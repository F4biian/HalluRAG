        "content": "Beth Israel Lahey Health (BILH) is a non-profit integrated health system based in Massachusetts, with locations in New Hampshire. Formed through the 2019 merger of two large Massachusetts health systems led by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, it is the largest health system in Massachusetts by count of hospitals, with 10 acute-care hospitals in the state.\n\n\n== History ==\nBeth Israel Deaconess (BID) and Lahey Health first publicly expressed their intention to merge in 2013, when they shared with employees that the two systems were in talks with each other and several physician groups, including Atrius Health, to form an alliance that may see a formal merger between the hospital systems. While talks were off and on for years, the two systems repeatedly expressed their desire to merge, largely to compete with Mass General Brigham (called Partners Healthcare at the time), which was a dominating force in the Massachusetts health care market.\nTalk about a merger became more serious in 2017, when BID and Lahey appeared to resolve a dispute over the leadership structure of the potential system which had halted talks in the past. As part of the agreement, BID's CEO Kevin Tabb, MD would take the help as the combined system's CEO, Lahey's board chairwoman would become the combined system's chairwoman, and the system's board as a whole would consist of an equal split of members from each system. Additionally, three small hospitals outside of either system joined the talks: New England Baptist Hospital of Boston, Mount Auburn Hospital of Cambridge, and Anna Jaques Hospital of Newburyport. The final merger agreement was signed by the hospitals in July 2013.\nState and federal regulators officially approved the deal in January 2018. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy placed requirements on the new health system, including that they cap price increases for their first seven years, make efforts to increase the number of Medicaid patients they serve and ensure their doctors accept Medicaid, and that they spend spend $72 million over eight years to support health resources for low-income and mental health patients, among other requirements. The system was required to pay for an independent firm to monitor their compliance with the AG's deal for 10 years. Following this deal, the newly formed health system was named Beth Israel Lahey Health.\nBILH's first big interstate expansion occurred in 2023, when the system acquired Exeter Hospital in Exeter, New Hampshire.\n\n\n== Services ==\n\n\n=== Hospitals ===\nThis is a list of BILH's acute care hospitals in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Worthy of note is that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts considers Addison Gilbert Hospital and Beverly Hospital to be two campuses of one hospital called Northeast Hospital. However, most of BILH's public facing information regards them as separate hospitals. These are considered separate entities for the purposes of this list.\n\n\n=== Other services ===\nAs an integrated care system, BILH offers a variety of services, including primary care, urgent care, assisted living, and Emergency Medical Services.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Soldiers of the Burkina Faso Armed Forces were deployed in United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) between 2013 and 2023. During the mission, Burkinabe forces were the largest contributor to the mission, and often belonged to the best elements of the Burkinabe army.\n\n\n== Badenya Battalion ==\nThe Badenya Battalion, meaning brotherhood in Bambara, was deployed in Timbuktu and Ber, and is sometimes called BFA BAT 1. The Badenya Battalion was first deployed in Diabaly as part of African-led International Support Mission to Mali (MISMA), the predecessor to MINUSMA, but then deployed to Gao and Timbuktu following MINUSMA's creation. Until 2017, the protection of the Timbuktu Airport was the battalion's main priority. They were replaced in 2017 by an Ivorian infantry company, although Burkinabe units defended the entrance to the nearby MINUSMA super camp. In 2018, the Badenya Battalion defended the camp and airport from jihadists during the 2018 Timbuktu attack at the camp.The Badenya battalion was also responsible for securing and defending a large number of MINUSMA supply convoys across Mali, and defended the MINUSMA base in Ber in 2018. In 2015, during a supply mission, the battalion was the target of jihadists in an ambush near Takoumbaout.\nThe Badenya Battalion's mandate was not renewed in January 2019, and the soldiers and their equipment were transferred to the Gondaal Battalion. Many Badenya soldiers were transferred back home to fight the growing jihadist insurgency in Burkina Faso.\n\n\n== Gondaal Battalion ==\nThe Gondaal Battalion, meaning \"good understanding\" in Fulfulde, was deployed in Diabaly from 2015 to 2023, with detachments in Léré and Goundam. It is sometimes referred to as BFA BAT 2. In September 2017, the Lere camp was transferred to the control of Malian forces from G5 Sahel. The Gondaal Battalion had 850 soldiers from 2015 to 2018.\n\n\n== Other units and equipment ==\nIn June 2016, 140 gendarmes were transferred to Gao under the command of Kanou Coulibaly within the 31st Peacekeeping Squadron, and were replaced by 140 new gendarmes in June 2017. A Burkinabe officer within MINUSMA committed suicide at his office in Gao on March 3, 2017.The Badenya's platoons are equipped with Serbian Zastava M70 assault rifles and Zastava M84 machine guns as well as RPG-7 rocket launchers. They are also equipped with DShK and ZPU-2 heavy machine guns and 81mm and 120mm mortars. The company is motorized on Toyota Land Cruiser pick-ups, Ural-4320 trucks, and 30 ACMAT Bastion personnel carriers. Due to constant movement, the equipment wears out quickly.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Georgia will compete in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2024 in Spain. For the seventh year in a row, the children's talent show Ranina will be used to choose Georgia's representative.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nPrior to the 2024 contest, Georgia have participated in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest sixteen times since its debut in 2007, having never missed a contest since then. Georgia is also the most successful country in the competition, with three victories in 2008, 2011 and 2016.\nIn the 2023 Junior Eurovision Song Contest, Anastasia Vasadze represented Georgia with the song \"Over the Sky\" following her victory in the sixth season of Ranina. She was joined on stage by the also Ranina finalists Nikoloz Kharati and Oto Bazerashvili, finishing 14th place with 74 points.\n\n\n== Before Junior Eurovision ==\n\n\n=== Ranina ===\nFor the seventh year in a row, Georgia are using an original children's talent show format, Ranina (Georgian: რანინა), as the selection method for their artist. GPB opened applications on 28 November 2023 and held castings in December to select the contestants. The final list of artists was revealed on 1 January 2024 on the official Facebook page of Ranina, publishing ten videos where the family of the contestants broke the news to them on New Year's Eve.\nClassical pianist Datuna Aladashvili is the main host of the seventh season of Ranina, a role that he has held since the first season. During the shows, former contestant Vache Ghviniashvili joins him at the studio.\nThe format of Ranina remains unchanged from previous seasons, as all ten contestants compete across four thematic tours in the main round, where they perform accompanied by a live orchestra and famous singers or bands from Georgia. Each tour is divided in two episodes. Each time that they perform, the artists are rated by a three-member jury, who can award up to ten points to each artist in four categories: vocals, performance, artistry and involvement. All the scores are added up and, at the end of the fourth tour, the five artists with the highest scores will advance to the semi-final. In the semi-finalists, the five artists are rated by the jury following the same system to select three finalists. The winner of the final will also be chosen by a three-member jury. Every episode is broadcast on Saturdays at 21:30 GET.\n\n\n==== Tour 1 ====\nIn the first tour, the ten contestants covered songs by the Georgian composers Roma Rtskhiladze and Gia Macharashvili, joined on stage by past Ranina contestants. The first episode featured five songs by Rtskhiladze, who sat in the jury, and the second episode featured five songs by Macharashvili, who also joined the jury.\n\n\n==== Tour 2 ====\nIn the second tour, the ten contestants covered Georgian classic songs accompanied by young Georgian musicians Giga Gigashvili and Beka Gochiashvili. The first episode of the tour featured Gigashvili on stage and Gochiashvili in the jury, and the roles reversed for the second episode.\n\n\n==== Tour 3 ====\nThe third tour is dedicated to Georgian folklore, as all ten contestants will perform traditional songs alongside the ensemble Shavnabada.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Fossils are known from the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia and North America. The monophyly of the group has been questioned, with some authors suggesting that Peradectes should be the only genus placed in the family. The morphology of peradectids has been considered to be similar to opossums. Phylogenetic analysis suggest that they are less closely related to modern marsupials than herpetotheriids are.\n\nCladogram after:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "41 and 43 Low Petergate is a historic building in the city centre of York, in England.\nThe building lies on Low Petergate, one of the main streets in the city centre.  The front section is a timber-framed building dating from the late 14th century.  It was extended to the rear, in brick, in the 18th century.  At the time, it was used as a coffee shop, and it remained the Garrick Coffee House until 1860.  The building was grade II* listed in 1954.  Since 2011, it has housed a branch of Neal's Yard Remedies.\nThe front of the three-storey building is jettied, with the timberwork covered in plaster and whitewashed.  At ground floor level is a timber shopfront, with a 20th-century bow window.  The upper floors have sash windows dating from the 1760s.  The cornice has an elaborate drainpipe head, decorated with rosettes.  The rear is also of three storeys, the left bay having a round-headed staircase window, with a sash above.  Inside, much timber framing is visible, as is the crown post roof in the front section.  Early features include the cellar door, the 18th-century first floor staircase, and a ladder staircase to the attic, along with 17th- and 18th-century panelling and doors in the front and back rooms on the first and second floors.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bhava Brihaspati was a 12th-century Kanyakubja Brahmin ascetic of Pashupata sect of Hinduism. He was the teacher of Paramara kings of Malwa and Chaulukya king Jayasimha Siddharaja.Born into city of Banaras, he left his home and migrated to Malwa and temporarily resided in Dhara and in Ujjain. There he superintended the Shaiva monasteries, gained certain Paramara chieftains for the Shaiva faith and wrote a textbook on explaining about doctrines of Pashupata Shaivism.\nSeeing the temple of Shiva in a ruined state, Brihaspati exhorted Chaulukya ruler Kumarapala to restore the decayed Somnath temple. The king readily agreed, made Brihaspati the lord of all Shaiva temple-priests in his dominions, bestowed presents of ornaments, two elephants and pearl-necklaces and entrusted to him the governorship of Somnathpattan.\n\n\n== Somnathpattan Prashasti inscription ==\nThe object of this inscription from the 12th century at Somnath temple is to celebrate the virtues of the Bhava Brihaspati and to hand down to posterity a record of his great deeds. The poet boldly asserts that Brihaspati was an incarnation of Shiva's attendant Nandishwara, who assumed a mortal body in order to insure the restoration of the god's sanctuary at Somnathpattan.the 9th paragraph of the inscription states:\nThat man [Bhava Brihaspati] of saintly disposition, being reminded by Shambhu of the cause of his descent into the world, turned his mind towards [the accomplishment of] its object, the renovation of the (sacred) locality. Even on that same day illustrious Siddharaja, joining his hands in supplication, bestowed on him out of great regard an unequalled greatness and honour.\nA later inscription, referring to Bhava Brihaspati, states: Lord Shiva, observing that dharma was disappearing under the rule of bad kings in the Kaliyuga, decided that his abode should be repaired. Shiva reincarnated a part of himself and took birth as Bhava Brihaspati in the family of a Kanyakubja Brahmin.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Babyloniaca is a text written in the Greek language by the Babylonian priest and historian Berossus in the 3rd century BC. Although the work is now lost, it survives in substantial fragments from subsequent authors, especially in the works of the fourth-century AD Christian author and bishop Eusebius, and was known to a limited extent in learned circles as late as late antiquity. Substantial sections, including one on the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II, are also preserved in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus, especially in his Antiquities of the Jews and Against Apion. Until the rediscovery of cuneiform texts in the 19th century (which, for a while, drew attention away from the study of the works of Berossus), the fragments of the works of Berossus were the only genuine surviving material known from Mesopotamian civilization. During the 1970s, a German archaeological expedition discovered cuneiform texts with a kings list in Uruk similar to what is recorded in the second book of the Babyloniaca, which reinstated some confidence in the ability of the Babyloniaca to attest to genuine material from earlier periods, which, in turn, revived the scholarship addressing this work.\nThe Babyloniaca is structured into three books. The first recounts Babylonian geography and a variant of the cosmogony of the Enūma Eliš, as well as the transition of the existence of man prior to the divine law and after it had been revealed. The second and third books largely concern kingly genealogies and an account of the flood. An English edition of the text was first published by Burstein in 1978. A detailed study on the sources Berossus consulted for the third and final book of the Babyloniaca has also been produced as well as his conception of the creation story.\n\n\n== Context and survival ==\nAfter the conquests of Alexander the Great, the response of the newly conquered local populations was largely that of despair. However, some of the cultural and religious elite embraced the new leadership and attempted to educate their Hellenistic overlords on Mesopotamian traditions. The first known example of such a text written in Greek was the Babyloniaca, composed in 281 BC in dedication to the ascent of Antiochus I Soter to the throne of the Seleucid Empire. This work can be thought of as emerging out of the cultural and scientific milieu fostered by the Esagila Temple. In the preface, Berossus states his intent in writing the Babyloniaca, identifying himself as both a contemporary of Alexander and a Chaldean priest of Bel. Most readers of the Babyloniaca in classical and late antiquity did not read the original Babyloniaca, but rather an abridgement of it found in a work by the first century AD writer Alexander Polyhistor. This text consisted of a history of Babylonia (relying mostly on Berossus) followed by a history of Assyria. This work is also lost, but yet another abridgement was made of the work of Polyhistor by Eusebius in the fourth century, in the first book of his Chronicon. Finally, this work of Eusebius is extant from the Ecloga Chronographica of the Byzantine monk George Syncellus. Fortunately for contemporary historians, both Polyhistor and Eusebius appear to have preserved the basic organization of the texts they were working with.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe Babyloniaca contains three books. Berossus followed the earlier Mesopotamian view, as opposed to the perspective of the Greek historians, that history was largely driven by divine revelation and intervention as opposed to the being the unravelling of human activities over time. The Babyloniaca is organized in reflection of this: the first book, after describing why Berossus wrote the Babyloniaca, contains information about cosmology and the geography of Babylonia and a description of mankind's animalistic state prior to revelation. Then, during the reign of the king Alorus, the divine messenger Oannes speaks to humanity and communicates the basic principles of civilization. The second book is divided into three sections: the reign of ten kings over 432,000 years prior to the flood; the catastrophe of the global flood; and the reign of kings after the flood, up until the reign of Nabu-Naṣir (Nabonassar) in 787 BC. The third book continues with the more recent succession of kings, from Nabu-Naṣir down to the reign of Alexander the Great, although the extant sections of the text do not allow us to know the degree to which Berossus merely listed this succession as opposed to providing more detailed commentary. According to Polyhistor, commentary was mostly lacking from the chain of dynastic succession contained in the second book. However, it is apparent that the period of the Achaemenid Empire (Persian rule) was treated briefly and that the reigns of Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar II were treated at more length.\n\n\n== Editions and translations ==\nBurstein, Stanley Mayer.

The attack killed nineteen people, mostly refugees, and many residents of the camp fled Nguetchewe following the attack due to fears about their safety. Some of the refugees made their way to the refugee camps in Kouyape, neat the town of Goldavi in Far North.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nAround 1,200 people were present in the village of Kouyape and the surrounding camps at the time of the attack. At 1:00 AM on September 1, around 100 Boko Haram fighters launched an incursion into the village. A vigilante present in Kouyape alerted the Cameroonian Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) of the attack, and BIR soldiers counter-attacked quickly. As Boko Haram withdrew from the village, a suicide bomber exploded and killed four people on the scene, excluding the bomber. Seven others were injured in the attack as well. \nTwo Boko Haram fighters were killed during the attack, including the suicide bomber and a fighter killed by BIR. The death toll later rose to seven killed, and fourteen others injured.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Independent Shakespeare Co. (commonly known as Indyshakes or ISC) is a nonprofit theatre company, based in Los Angeles.  They most frequently stage theatrical productions of the works of William Shakespeare and other Elizabethan and Jacobean classics, in addition to modern classics and developing new devised, musical, and solo works.\nThe company is responsible for the Griffith Park Free Shakespeare Festival, which draws audiences of roughly 50,000 Angelenos in an average summer and is one of the most attended and notable Shakespeare in the Park Festivals in the United States.\n\n\n== Founding and company history ==\nDavid Melville and Melissa Chalsma met as ensemble members in the 1995 Tony Award winning \nBroadway production of Hamlet starring Ralph Fiennes. This production, directed by Jonathan Kent, had transferred from the Almeida Theatre in London.\nAfter marrying and settling in New York City, they founded their own Shakespeare company in 1998. They named their company \"Independent\", in reference to their belief in centering the needs, growth, and empowerment of artists.\n\nIf you want to design a system to disempower people...you could design the system of acting in this country. Getting a job is a job in itself.\nISC's first 1999 production of Henry V cost just $800 to produce and took place at 10pm in a small theatre, following another ensemble's production of Pigoletto; Rigoletto with a pig.\nChalsma and Melville relocated to Los Angeles in June 2001 so they could raise their young family while continuing their art making. In 2002, they began performing in various venues throughout the city, finally finding a home at Barnsdall Art Park in 2004. Their first audience of just 20 people, grew to 300 the following year and increased every subsequent year until they outgrew Barnsdall and made the move to Griffith Park in 2010 where they quickly began to accommodate audiences of over 1,000.\nIn 2015, the Department of Recreation and Parks moved forward with building plans for the permanent stage at the Old Zoo site championed by Councilmember Tom LaBonge which has yet to be completed.\nISC weathered the COVID-19 pandemic by increasing remote and cinematic offerings. They also shifted their Griffith Park location further up the hill and limited their audience capacity for the summer festivals in 2021 and 2022. They returned to their primary location in 2023.\n\n\n== Production history and venues ==\nIndependent Shakespeare Co.'s early years were marked by a state of transcience, securing various spaces they could afford in New York and Los Angeles for performances and rehearsals.\nJust after their first summer in Barnsdall Art Park, ISC toured their production of Richard III in France as part of the 100th anniversary of the Entente Cordiale.\nISC's style is characterized by productions that are free and accessible, centering clarity of the text with an ensemble that also reflects the diversity of Los Angeles. Their productions are also known for their use of original music and covers breathe life into classical works that are frequently produced.\n\n\n=== Free Shakespeare in Barnsdall Art Park ===\nWith support from the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, ISC established a residency in Barnsdall in 2004 with their first production The Two Gentlemen of Verona. During this time they ran up to three productions in repertory.\nDuring this formative time for the company they performed for small audiences that were often interrupted by soccer games, helicopter traffic, and various forms of noise pollution.\n\nIt was our first year and a performance of 'Two Gentlemen of Verona'. And a mom with her kids was watching us rehearse. We said you should come back for the show tonight and she said, no she couldn’t afford it. And we said it’s free! She couldn’t believe it and we encouraged her to stay. She did, and we had a very small audience. Twenty two people that night so I saw her right there. And afterwards we pulled our little hats and buckets for donations; and I look over to David who was asking the meager crowd for donations. And this mother went up to him, took his hands, said thank you. And then her little boy reached into his pocket and took out all his change and put it into David’s donation bucket. And I had tears in my eyes. And I thought; ‘That’s it....apparently I will be doing this for the rest of my life.\n\n\n=== Griffith Park Free Shakespeare Festival ===\nHaving outgrown Barnsdall, the company moved to Griffith Park near the site of the Old Los Angeles Zoo on the park's east side in 2010, which enabled the company to accommodate bigger crowds. They began with average audiences of 700 people per performance; significantly more than Barnsdall's approved capacity of just 485. In the years since, that number has increased with audiences that range from 1,000 to the occasional 3,000 Angelenos on peak weekend evenings for popular works such as Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Nights Dream. ISC produces an average of two works in Griffith Park that run in repertory or separately.\n\n\n=== ISC Studio ===\nIn 2011, the company secured a dedicated indoor space for programming, rehearsals, and classes near Griffith Park in Atwater Village. The ISC Studio offers programming year round that tends to be devised, musical, and solo works born of their ensemble in early development or more experimental explorations of classics.\nEach year they produce a two-person version of A Christmas Carol titled A Christmas Carol with Charles Dickens in which David Melville performs the piece (with the help of an assistant) in the style of Dickens. ISC also produces Iambic Lab which is an annual exploration of theatrical themes with primarily free programming that ranges from guest lectures to staged readings.\n\n\n== Notable personalities ==\nThe ISC Advisory Council includes Ralph Fiennes, Jonathan Kent, Paul McCrane, John C.

        "content": "\"Gangsta\" is a song by American R&B band Free Nationals, American rapper ASAP Rocky and American singer Anderson .Paak. It was released on February 23, 2024, with an accompanying music video.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Gangsta\" is a retro-soul song combining elements of funk and jazz, and has been described as \"free-flowing\". The production contains \"psychedelic strings, pocket drumming, movie samples, and record scratches\". The song opens with the chorus, sung by Anderson .Paak, followed by a verse from ASAP Rocky, who reflects on how his father taught him his \"gangster\" ways and boasts the extravagant aspects of his lifestyle, including women.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nTallie Spencer of HotNewHipHop called the song a \"testament to the creative synergy that occurs when like-minded artists come together to push the boundaries of musical expression\" and \"standout track, solidifying its place as a must-listen in the evolving landscape of contemporary music.\" Aaron Williams of Uproxx commented the song \"amalgamates the signature components of each act, and results in untouchable musical chemistry.\" In addition, he described the production as \"brilliant\", that ASAP Rocky \"taps into a sense of bravado\", and Anderson .Paak's \"soulful\" performance as \"somehow making the life of a gangster sound smooth and sweet.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video was directed by François Rousselet and is set in a world governed by children. Kid versions of ASAP Rocky and Anderson .Paak wear stylish outfits and drive through a cartoon Los Angeles in a muscle car, where the streets are lined with playhouses; they rob a liquor store with others, perform in front of a private jet, defend themselves in court, engage in Super Soaker shootouts and throw Molotov cocktails. In one scene, it is revealed that the events of the video are from the imagination of a child playing in a bathtub.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The presidential standard of Turkey is the official flag that represents the President of Turkey in his capacity as the head of state and commander-in-chief of the Turkish Armed Forces. This distinctive flag, also known as the Presidential Flag, is an emblem of the authority and dignity vested in the office of the President.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe use of a presidential standard in Turkey dates back to the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923. Initially, the presidential standard closely resembled the national flag of Turkey, with the addition of a gold fringe around the edges to distinguish it from the standard flag. The first document to regulate the Presidential Standard officially is the Flag Regulation issued on October 22, 1925. In this regulation, the definition of the Presidential Standard is provided.\nThe origin of the coat of arms and emblem used today is attributed to Hüsnü Tengüz, the Chief Engraver of the Naval Press. Upon the order of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the production of a presidential coat of arms was requested. This request, conveyed to the Naval Press from the Istanbul Military Tailoring House.\nOn May 29, 1936, Law No. 2994 on the Turkish Flag was enacted, and on September 14, 1937, Regulation No. 2/7175 on the Turkish Flag was accepted. In the annex referred to in Article 36 of this regulation, it is stated that the sun rays in the Presidential Standard are ten each (ten oval, ten pointed). The dimensions of the standard are 70 cm by 70 cm. \nLater, with an Additional Regulation to the Regulation on the Turkish Flag, the dimensions of the standard were determined as 30 cm by 30 cm. This time, with the enforcement of the Regulation Amending the Regulation on the Turkish Flag on February 18, 1978, two new amendments were made. The sun rays in the center of the standard are arranged as 8 long and 8 short rays, lined up in the sequence of one long, one short. It was also determined that all 16 rays, which were determined to be a total of 16, have pointed tips (triangular in shape).\nThe current standard is used according to Article 28 of the Regulation on the Turkish Flag dated January 25, 1985, numbered 85/9034, and the relevant example referred to in this article. The view that the sun in the Presidential Standard represents the Republic of Turkey and the 16 stars represent the independent Turkish states was first put forward in 1969 by Map Officer Akîp Özbek in his book \"The Turkish Presidential Standard and its Meaning.\" This view has been accepted in the following years. In addition to this, other views have been expressed especially regarding the 16 stars. According to one view, 9 of the 16 stars represent the 9 banners used by the ancient (Central Asian) Turks, and the remaining 7 stars represent the 7 banners used by the Anatolian Turks. Thus, the total of 9+7 equals 16.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Design and symbolism ==\nThe Presidential Standard of Turkey features a red field with a white star and crescent emblem in the center. The star and crescent are traditional symbols of Turkish identity and are deeply rooted in the country's history and culture. The red background symbolizes valor, courage, and the blood shed by the nation's defenders throughout history.\nThe star and crescent emblem is positioned prominently in the center of the flag, with the star pointing upwards and the crescent facing to the right. This orientation of the star and crescent is consistent with the design of the national flag of Turkey, which also features these symbols.\nIn Article 27 of the \"Turkish Flag Regulation,\" numbered 85/9034 and dated January 25, 1985, the dimensions of were specified by the cabinet of Turkey.\n\nThe exact black, gold, and red colors to be used in the emblem are specified with reference to the regulations.\n\n\n== Usage and protocol ==\nThe presidential standard of Turkey is displayed whenever the President is present at official ceremonies, events, or functions. It is also hoisted on official buildings, residences, and vehicles associated with the President.\nAccording to protocol, the presidential standard is afforded the same level of respect and reverence as the national flag of Turkey. It is saluted by military personnel and civilians alike as a symbol of the highest office in the country.\n\n\n== Related symbols ==\nIn addition to the presidential standard, the Turkish president may also use other symbols and emblems to represent the office and authority of the presidency. These may include the Presidential Seal, which is used on official documents and communications, as well as other emblems of Turkey, which features the star and crescent emblem along with other national symbols.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nFlag of Turkey\nPresidential Seal of Turkey\n16 Great Turkic Empires\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Presidential flags of Turkey at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Julia Seton (also Kapp and Sears; 1862–1950) was an American physician, lecturer and author. After graduating from medical school and working as a physician, Seton modernized the concept of \"the Science of Names and Numbers\" to what is referred to today as numerology, and it is through her work that numerology became known by the general public. She was friends with Sarah Balliett who created the modern style of numerology.\nSeton's work represented a million and a half people, of whom 6,000-8,000 were confessed believers. She asserted that \"New Thought was a religion\", and she was its self-appointed high-priestess. According to Seton, New Thought was a product of the twentieth century thought and need and it had its birth in human experience and human enfoldment. Seton served the president of the New Thought School, Boston, Massachusetts, Brockton, Massachusetts, Brooklyn, New York, and Manhattan, New York. In 1905, she founded the New Civilization Church, in Santa Monica, California.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJulia Lorinda Seton was born in Illinois, December 27, 1862. Her parents were Israel Marion and Jane Rhoda (Dickerson) Seton.\nShe was educated in the schools of Cleveland, Ohio, and Boston, Massachusetts. Subsequently, to teaching for five years in Ohio, she studied medicine, and in 1898, was graduated M.D. at Gross Medical University (now, University of Colorado School of Medicine), Denver, Colorado. She pursued a post-graduate course in 1902–03 at Tufts Medical College, Boston.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSeton practiced as a medical physician until 1903.\nHaving been successful from childhood in applying subjective laws to objective expressions, her desire to deal more with the cause than with the effect impelled her to follow her inclinations and devote her life to metaphysical work. Beginning with a small class in Huntington Chambers, Boston, in 1904, she took larger quarters in Richards Hall a few months later.\nIn 1906, she went to New York City and commenced teaching and lecturing in a studio in Carnegie Hall. These quarters soon became inadequate for the Sunday service and in 1908, the Belasco Theatre was leased. In 1910, quarters were secured in the New York American building. That same year, Seton went to Europe and established in London the First New Thought Church and School of London. By the time Seton had returned to New York, the Sunday morning services of the New Thought Church in that city had moved to the Forty-eighth Street Theater and were attended by hundreds of people.\n\nSeton was the founder of the New Thought Summer School at the Home of the New Civilization, Oscawana-on-the-Hudson, New York. This was a school for students, post-graduate philosophers, scientists, metaphysicians, psychologists, and mystics. Self-healing and the higher physical, intellectual and spiritual unfoldment were taught, including such subjects as the following: \"Science of Life,\" \"Science of Success, \"Laws of Self-Healing,\" \"The Conquest of Poverty,\" \"The Truth on Life and Death,\" \"New Mysticism,' \"Concentration,\" \"Silence,\" \"Public Speaking,\" Fundamentals of New Thought Church and School,\" \"The Race Problem-Money\" and \"The New Civilization.\" The property of the Oscawana Association included 140 acres (57 ha) of woodland with walks, drives, trees, flowers, birds and running brooks. The grounds of the association were covered with tents and small bungalows, and a large inn. A teachers' class was held for those who wanted to qualify as instructors, teachers and preachers for the New Thought churches of the New Civilization. In addition, there were many associate teachers of philosophy and religion from different centers, and through this the student had the advantage of increased physical research.\nSeton lectured at the League for the Larger Life in Washington, D.C., in 1923 after having completed a trip around the world covering a period of two years in which she visited every continent.\nSeton's power of expression helped her to attain an enviable position as a writer of metaphysical literature. She was a prolific author of more than a dozen books. Her magazine articles appeared in Nautilus, Reality, Success, Aquarian Age, Rally (London), Liberty (Australia), and Woman's Way (New Zealand). She was a member of the Massachusetts Medical Society since 1903 and of the American Medical Association since 1908. Seton was also a member of the Denver Medical Society, and the Colorado Woman's Medical Association. She was the president of the New-Thought School in New York City and Boston. She was a member of the Silver State Circle No. 7, Women of Woodcraft.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe was twice married: (1) December 7, 1882, to Samuel Stephen Kapp (1859–1939), of Cleveland, Ohio; (2), November 16, 1903, in Denver, Colorado, to Franklin Warren Sears, pastor of New-Thought Church, New York City. After their divorce in 1914, she took again her maiden name of Julia Seton. There was one child by her first union: Dr. Juno Belle Kapp, wife of Dr. Roy Page Walton.\nJulia Seton died in Ocala, Florida, April 27, 1950.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to The Short Cut to Regeneration Through Fasting at Wikisource, by Julia Seton, M.D.\nWorks by or about Julia Seton at Internet Archive\nJulia Seton Sears, via cornerstone.wwwhubs.com",

        "content": "The Roundabout Club, formerly Sandy Town Hall, is a bar and music venue in Sandy, Bedfordshire, a town in England. It has never been the meeting place of any of the local authorities in the area.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn January 1904, a group of local businessmen, linked to the Liberal Party, formed a private company, known as the \"Town Hall Company\", to finance and commission a public events venue for the town. The group was led by a pioneer of the smallholdings movement, Sir Robert Edgcumbe, who lived at Sandye Place. The site they selected was open land just to the west of the local Baptist chapel.\nThe new building was designed by Alfred Ernest Anthony of Usher & Anthony in the Tudor Revival style, built in brick with exposed timbers by a local contractor, Messrs. Haynes and Fennemore, and was opened as Sandy Town Hall in September 1906. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto Bedford Road. The central bay featured a wide single storey portico formed by four Tuscan order columns supporting an entablature, a cornice and a balcony. The first floor was rendered, with an ornamental half-timbered effect, and fenestrated with three casement windows. There was a pedimented stone inscribed with the words \"town hall\" in the centre of the gable which was surmounted by a belltower.\nDuring the First World War, the building accommodated a Voluntary Aid Detachment hospital. In 1920, the building was converted into a venue for silent film shows known as the \"Victory Cinema\", with a capacity of 400 people and a proscenium arch which was 25 feet (7.6 m) wide. Silent film shows were accompanied by music from the Sandy String Band. The venue was later taken over by the Cox Cinema Company, based in Biggleswade.  The cinema was damaged in a fire in 1948, but was restored and reopened in 1950 as the \"Albany Cinema\".  It closed in February 1964, but was occasionally used by the Sandy Film Club to show films over the next few years.  By 1981, it had been converted into \"The Roundabout Club\".\nAlthough the building has never been the meeting place of either the former urban district council or the local parish council, now the town council, the pavement in front of the building performs a civic role as the location for the saluting stand for the annual military parade held each Remembrance Sunday.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "HAT-P-67 is a binary star system, made up of a F-type subgiant and a red dwarf star, which is located about 1,200 light-years away in the constellation Hercules. There is a hot Saturn planet orbiting the primary star, which is named HAT-P-67b.\n\n\n== Stellar system ==\nThe stellar system consists of the F class primary star with an red dwarf companion separated by 9 arc-seconds or about 3400 astronomical units. According to measurements taken by the Gaia spacecraft the two stars have nearly identical parallax and proper motions confirming that they are a binary system.\nThe primary star is a rapidly rotating subgiant star with a radius 2.65 times that of the sun and a mass 1.64 times that of the sun.\nLittle is known of the secondary star other than it is a M-dwarf.\n\n\n== Planetary system ==\nThere is one known planet orbiting HAT-P-67A. HAT-P-67b is a gas giant planet transiting its parent star  every 4.8 days, at an orbital distance of 0.065 astronomical units (9,700,000 km). It is one of the largest and lowest density planets known as of 2024.\n\n\n=== Discovery ===\nTransits of HAT-P-67b were discovered by the Hungarian Automated Telescope Network (HATNet), using small, wide field telescopes, located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona and at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. Observations were made in 2005 and 2008, analysis of the obtained data revealed the periodic transits of HAT-P-67b. Follow-up photometry of the transits were obtained using the 1.2 m telescope at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory. A full transit was observed on 2012 May 28, and five partial transits were observed in 2011, 2012 and 2013.\nThe high rotational velocity of the star made initial attempts to confirm the planet using radial velocity measurements difficult, with data from 2009 showing that the transiting object was less massive than a brown dwarf. Using measurements taken from 2009 to 2012 the Keck telescope was able to determine that the mass of the planet was less than 0.59 that of Jupiter. In 2016 Doppler tomography was used to confirm the planet.\n\n\n=== Characteristics ===\nWith a radius of over double that of Jupiter's HAT-P-67 b is one of the largest exoplanets known to date. It also one of the least dense at approximately 0.05 grams per cubic centimeter, a density lower than that of marshmallows.\nAn analysis of a radial velocity time series obtained at the Galileo National Telescope detected the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect and determined the projected spin-orbit angle to be 2.2 ± 0.4°. The calculated value suggests an aligned planetary orbit, indicating that the planet likely migrated to its present orbit through tidal interactions with a protoplanetary gas disk.\n\n\n=== Atmosphere ===\nGas giants with masses less than Jupiter's, and temperatures greater than 1800 K, like HAT-P-67 b, which has an equilibrium temperature of approximately 1900 K, are so inflated and puffed out that they are all on unstable evolutionary paths which eventually lead to roche lobe overflow and the evaporation and loss of the planet's atmosphere.\nA team of astronomers led by Aaron Bello-Arufe used the CARMENES spectrograph at the Calar Alto Observatory to study the atmosphere of HAT-P-67b. Based on this data, the planet's atmosphere seems to be highly ionized and may be escaping at a rate of 10 million tons per second. The team detected sodium and ionized calcium in the atmosphere of HAT-P-67b. Ionized calcium is typically found in hotter planets; however, it was detected quite prominently in the spectrum of HAT-P-67b.\nThe data also revealed absorption in the hydrogen and helium lines, typically a sign that part of the atmosphere is escaping into space. In the case of HAT-P-67b, these signals were detected before and after the planet's transit, suggesting the possibility of a vast cloud of gas escaping far beyond the planet. A different team led by Michael Gully-Santiago performed a multiyear spectroscopic survey of HAT-P-67 b, using the Habitable Zone Planet Finder on the Hobby–Eberly Telescope. They observed a prominent leading tail and a significantly fainter trailing tail, which they interpreted as direct evidence of preferential mass loss on the dayside. A third team using an average of many spectra acquired after transits found a clear absorption signal. They estimated an effective planetary radius 6 times that of Jupiter, indicating that the planet's atmosphere is evaporating.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia  entry for Hat-P-67b",

        "content": "Blue Bridge was built in the 1830s to span the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR) but now spans an empty cutting near Wolverton Works in Buckinghamshire, southern England. It was designed by Robert Stephenson, the L&BR's chief engineer and extended in the 188s when the line was widened. It is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge is an accommodation bridge, built to provide access to a farm after the road was severed by the construction of the railway. It has three elliptical arches in blue engineering brick which stand on piers of local coursed, squared limestone, faced with rock. The arches have substantial stone imposts and a stone course below parapet level. The parapets are in brick with a combination of stone and concrete coping. The much larger extension was built onto the end of the original. It has a pair of segmental arches almost entirely in blue brick. It has a broad stone roll cornice and a stepped parapet at the far end from the original bridge.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original bridge was designed by Robert Stephenson, the chief engineer to the London and Birmingham Railway, and was opened at roughly the same time as the line in 1838. The extension was built between 1878 and 1882 when the L&BR's successor, the London and North Western Railway quadruple-tracked the line. At the same time, the line was diverted slightly to the east to allow for an extension of Wolverton Works. The cutting under the original bridge is now empty. the line is now the West Coast Main Line, which passes under the extension. The bridge has since been bypassed by a modern replacement and is now disused.The original bridge is unusual among Stephenson's bridges in being built from stone rather than brick, likely material excavated from the cutting it spans. All other overbridges on this section of line were rebuilt in the 1950s when overhead electrification equipment was installed, making the Blue Bridge a possibly unique survivor. It is one of multiple surviving original L&BR bridges in the vicinity, including a bridge over the canal, that over Old Wolverton Road, and Wolverton Viaduct to the north of the town. The Blue Bridge has been a Grade II listed building 2001. Listed status provides legal protection from demolition or unsympathetic alteration.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sløborn (titled The Island in English release) is an apocalyptic German-Danish television series produced by Syrreal Entertainment, ZDF, Tobis Film, and Nordisk Film.  It consists of 3 seasons and 20 total episodes released between July 2020 and February 2024.\n\n\n== Background ==\nChristian Alvart was the primary creator of the series and its director.   It aired for three seasons between 2020 and 2024.  The series concerns a worldwide pandemic as it affects the residents of the fictional German island Sløborn located in the North Sea.  The first season was filmed before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, and debuted on the German ZDFneo channel in July 2020.  The parallels of the storyline to actual worldwide events helped fuel popularity of the series.\nThe vast majority of the show is in German, but the first season especially has scenes where characters with Danish background such as the roles played by Roland Møller and Mads Hjulman converse in Danish.  In the third season, two lesser characters speak English, and the main cast switch to English when addressing them.  \nThe title of the show is a play on the English phrase \"slow burn\", for a story that takes time to develop, which is most apparent in the first season of the show as the teenagers and adults on the island deal with more ordinary challenges of life as the \"Taubengrippe\" (Pigeon flu) begins to change their world.  The use of the \"ø\" in the title, a Scandinavian letter used in Danish, conveys that the fictional island is in a border area of Germany and Denmark.\nUnder the English title \"The Island\", seasons one and two of the show have been released with English subtitles.\n\n\n== Seasons ==\nThe first season (eight episodes) debuted on television in Germany on ZDFneo on July 23, 2020, when the first four episodes were aired, and the whole first season made available online on ZDF's website ZDFmediathek.   In November 2020, ZDF announced that the series had been renewed for a second season, with shooting to being in February 2021.  ZDF stated at the time that it had been the most successful streaming ZDFneo series to date.  In English, the series debuted on the UK's Channel 4 streaming service on July 14, 2023.\nThe second season (six episodes) debuted online in Germany on January 7, 2022, and three episodes played on television on ZDFneo on January 11 and 12, 2022, and in two-episode offerings on ZDF starting on February 21, 2022.\nThe third season (six episodes) debuted online on February 2, 2024, and was broadcast in Germany on ZDFNeo during the night of February 2-3, 2024.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nThe primary cast includes Emily Kusche, Alexander Scheer, Mads Hjulmand, Lea van Acken Karla Nina Diedrich, Adrian Grünewald, and Wotan Wilke Möhring. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSløborn on IMDB",

        "content": "Table for Two is a collection of six short stories and a novella by the novelist Amor Towles. It was published by Viking Press in April 2024. The book is divided into two parts, with the six short stories connected to New York City and the novella set in Los Angeles.\nThe six short stories include tales about the experiences of a Russian peasant during the Russian Revolution and an aspiring author who becomes embroiled in a literary con. The novella centers on a character from one of Towles previous novels, Rules of Civility. The short stories received positive reviews from critics. The novella received mixed reviews.\n\n\n== Writing and development ==\nTowles first began writing short stories in high school and college, early experiences that he described as preparing him to develop Table for Two. The writing process for the collection involved Towles working at his desk for about four hours each morning. In the afternoon, he often sat at the bar of a restaurant to revise his work. During the drafting of the book, Towles also stayed for a week at the The Beverly Hills Hotel. In an interview with NPR, he described the stay as helping him to set the mood for his novella, Eve in Hollywood, which is set in the same city as the hotel, Los Angeles. Towles also talked with NPR about his decision to name the book Table for Two, stating the following:\n\nI was preparing to hand in the manuscript to my publisher, and I really didn't have a title at that time... What really leapt out at me was that in almost every story and in Eve, there are critical moments where there are two central characters sitting across from each other at a small table, often in a kitchen, and hashing out some significant element of their lives which has come to the surface through the events of that particular story.\nAt least one of the stories in Table for Two is autobiographical. In an interview, Towles recounted feeling incensed after observing a guest recording a performance at Carnegie Hall in violation of the facility's rules. That memory inspired the fifth story in the collection, Bootlegger.\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\n\n=== The line ===\nA simple, kindhearted man named Pushkin is uprooted from his life as a peasant in the countryside. He moves to Moscow at the behest of his wife, Irina, who wants to participate in the Russian Revolution. In the city, a woman asks Pushkin to hold her place in one of the many long lines for household staples. The amiable Pushkin agrees, asking nothing in return, but the woman rewards him with candies. This scenario repeats itself many times, and soon, Pushkin finds himself the recipient of many tokens of appreciation. Later, he holds a place in line for a man desiring a visa to leave the Soviet Union. To pass the time while holding the place, Puskin fills out a visa application for himself, in which he writes about his love for the Russian countryside. Pushkin ends up accidentally submitting the form, and it is approved by officials who find his responses moving. The visa enables Pushkin and his wife to travel to New York City, where they become separated. A lost Pushkin stumbles upon a queue for a soup kitchen, taking comfort in the familiarity of a line.\n\n\n=== The Ballad of Timothy Touchett ===\nTimothy is a recent college graduate who aspires to become a novelist. His ability to write, however, is impeded by self-doubt. He worries that he has no story to tell due to a lack of life experience, and he reflects that most great writers had some formative hardship that inspired their novels, such as living through war or great personal loss. Meanwhile, Timothy obtains a job at a bookstore that deals in rare editions of novels, and one day, the purveyor asks him to forge an author's signature in a book, claiming that it is for a dying friend who covets a signed edition. Similar requests follow and eventually Timothy finds himself in an illicit partnership in which he executes the forged signatures and the purveyor sells the copies at a large markup. The scheme comes undone when a living author discovers a forgery of his signature by the pair. The police come to arrest Timothy for fraud and to take him to Rikers Island, a place where Timothy can finally get the life experience he craved.\n\n\n=== Hasta Luego ===\nTwo strangers meet in the airport following the cancellation of flights due to a snowstorm. The narrator, Jerry, is emotionally removed, while the other man, Smith, is sincere and gregarious. They share a cab to a hotel, where Smith reluctantly agrees to sit at the bar. Smith begins drinking heavily, breaking a one-year sobriety. Jerry gets a call from Smith's wife, who implores Jerry to prevent Smith from drinking further. Throughout the rest of the story, Jerry surprises himself by going to great lengths to make sure Smith gets on his plane home without incident.    \n\n\n=== I will Survive ===\nJohn is a prominent lawyer in his sixties with a secret: he likes to roller skate in the park with a group of other men. The group gives John the moniker Gloria because he skates to the song I will Survive by Gloria Gaynor. John does not tell his wife, Peggy, about his hobby out of embarrassment, instead telling her that he is playing squash. Peggy becomes suspicious of his whereabout, but she does not want to know his real activities, preferring to remain blissfully unaware. Her daughter, Nell, follows John and uncovers his hobby, which she reveals in a video to Peggy. The seemingly innocuous video causes a rift in the marriage of John and Peggy, eventually contributing to their divorce. Nell must reckon with her culpability in the dissolution of the marriage, following her reveal of the video.\n\n\n=== The Bootlegger ===\nTommy becomes increasingly frustrated each time he sees another patron, on old man, recording performances at Carnegie Hall. He views the old man's actions as a distraction and as an affront to the rules of the institution. Tommy causes a scene when he brings the recordings to the attention of an usher. Consequently, the old man receives an indefinite ban from Carnegie Hall and before leaving, he tells Tommy that he was doing the recordings for his bedridden wife. Tommy feels terrible and tracks the old man down to apologize. He is confronted by the old man's daughter, who curses Tommy for his actions.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe book received mostly positive reviews. Writing for The Los Angeles Times, Leigh Haber described the book as \"filled with drama, wit, erudition and, most of all, heart\". Haber praised the development of the characters, especially the arc of the protagonist in the story Hasta Luego. For the Star Tribune, Chris Hewitt called the book “incredibly satisfying, old-fashioned storytelling with characters you care about”. In The New York Times, Herbert Cain called the book a \"winner\".  He commended the novella, “Eve in Hollywood”, for its sharp rendering of the 1930s and for its plot.\nOther critics disliked Eve in Hollywood, with Eric Olsen of theThe Washington Post describing it as the only piece in the collection in which Towles faltered. Olsen viewed the piece as excessively sentimental and as containing too many overly detailed backstories. In The Wall Street Journal, Joanne Kaufman also expressed dissatisfaction with the novella, calling it a \"self-indulgent brand extension\". Her comment referred to how Towles's resurrection of a character from his previous novel, Rules of Civility. Kaufman criticized the book overall as having \"a tone that rarely varies and characters who rarely convince\". She viewed the stakes as low and disliked when characters broke the fourth wall in the narration.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2023 Philip Schofield affair scandal was a period between May and June 2023, when revelations emerged of the TV presenter Philip Schofield having an extramarital affair with a younger male ITV co-worker. The affair came to light after Schofield's brother, Timothy Schofield, was found guilty of sexual offences against a teenage boy. The scandal eventually culminated in Schofield's resignation from ITV and from This Morning. As a result, ITV began requiring all workers at the network – including staff, consultants, contractors, freelancers, apprentices, and individuals on work experience – to disclose all personal relationships with colleagues.\n\n\n== Scandal ==\n\n\n=== Resignation from This Morning, ITV ===\nFollowing months of speculation about his private life, and widespread reports of a feud with co-host Willoughby, Schofield presented This Morning for the last time on 18 May 2023, after more than 20 years in the role. Two days later, he announced his departure from the programme with immediate effect, saying: \"ITV has decided the current situation can't go on, and I want to do what I can to protect the show that I love.\" A broadcasting executive subsequently told The Times that Willoughby had given ITV an ultimatum that either she or Schofield had to leave the programme.\n\n\n=== Admitting to affair ===\nIn a statement to the Daily Mail on 26 May, Schofield admitted that, before leaving his wife in 2020, he had carried on an extramarital affair with a younger male ITV co-worker. He had first met the co-worker while giving a talk at the drama school where the latter was then a 15-year-old student. Schofield later arranged a job interview for the co-worker at This Morning, where he was hired as a production assistant. Schofield stated that the affair had begun when the co-worker was 20 years old, at which point Schofield was in his mid-50s, and admitted lying about it to ITV's management, his colleagues, his lawyers, his agent and his friends and family. He resigned from ITV and apologised for his lies, while calling the relationship \"consensual\" and \"unwise but not illegal.\"\nITV said it had investigated rumours of a relationship between Schofield and the co-worker in early 2020, but that both men had repeatedly denied the affair. Stating that it was \"deeply disappointed by the admissions of deceit\" made by Schofield, ITV severed ties with him, and instructed a King's Counsel to carry out an external review of its handling of the incident. ITV confirmed that This Morning would continue without Schofield, and announced that Jane McDonald would replace him as host of The British Soap Awards. The talent agency YMU dropped Schofield after representing him for 35 years, and the Prince's Trust announced that it would no longer feature him as an ambassador, saying it was \"no longer appropriate to work together.\"\n\n\n== Coverage ==\nNews of Schofield's affair and departure from ITV received extensive coverage in the British media. Following his resignation, he gave separate interviews to the BBC and The Sun, in which he apologised to the co-worker for bringing the \"greatest misery into his totally innocent life.\" He denied grooming the man, and said that he had lied not to protect his own career but to preserve the co-worker's privacy. He said that the two had never been in a \"love affair\" and were still friends. He said his career was over; said he had \"lost everything\" and felt \"utterly broken\", embarrassed and ashamed; and claimed that if not for his daughters Ruby and Molly guarding him, he would have attempted suicide. Although he acknowledged the age difference, he said he believed homophobia was a factor in the media coverage, suggesting that an affair with a woman would not have created such a scandal.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\n\n=== Holly Willoughby, This Morning ===\nHolly Willoughby, who had previously said she was hurt that Schofield had lied to her when she asked about the rumours, returned to This Morning on 5 June for the first time since his departure. Stating that she felt \"shaken, troubled and let down,\" she said that everyone at the programme had given \"love and support to someone who was not telling the truth.\" She expressed concern for Schofield's mental health, thanked viewers for their kindness and support, and said \"what unites us all now is a desire to heal.\" Willoughby left This Morning four months later.\n\n\n=== ITV ===\nAs a result of the Schofield controversy, ITV in October 2023 began requiring all workers at the network – including staff, consultants, contractors, freelancers, apprentices, and individuals on work experience – to disclose all personal relationships with colleagues. The policy applies to co-workers in romantic or sexual relationships, but also to those who are friends or relatives, who live in the same household, or who share other close connections. Failure to comply with the policy can result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment.\n\n\n=== Male involved in affair ===\nIn February 2024, the BBC reported that Schofield made a six-figure payment to a colleague with whom he had an affair. Schofield compensated his former lover for the loss of his job and home, as well as legal fees, in a deal that included non-disclosure agreements for both sides.\n\n\n== References ==",

Players can use a variety of different spaceship types, and the game comes with six scenarios as well as a Do It Yourself option.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDana L. Cadman reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"Second Conflict is easy to learn, as there are few rules to contend with. In addition, the game runs under Windows 3.0, so it is very mouse-oriented and easy to use. Moving fleets, attacking and changing production are all handled through the menus and icons. ... Second Conflict is a great game for those who abhor complex rules or enjoy games with short turns. For those who like to define the arena for a battle by changing the victory conditions to fit one's mood. Second Conflict is a must. And remember, there is no such thing as a benevolent Empire.\"The Italian magazine Videogame & Computer World approved of the graphics and found that working in a Windows environment made the game easier and faster to play, and also complimented the manual.\n\n\n== References ==",

The battle was the first major incident in the 2007–2009 Tuareg rebellion.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Niger Movement for Justice was formed in February 2007 by Tuaregs in the rural, northern areas of Niger in tandem with Malian Tuareg movements led by Ibrahim Ag Bahanga. The MNJ was created as a response to heavy French and Western mining in Tuareg lands, and MNJ leaders desired more uranium mining revenue be directed to the impoverished Tuareg-inhabited regions. The MNJ's first attack on February 8 was in the town of Iferouane, which solidified the group's existence.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nPrior to the attack, eighty-seven Nigerien soldiers were present at the base in Tezerzaït, which lies at the base of Mount Tamgak in the Aïr Mountains in northern Niger. The MNJ stated that the attack was a response to Nigerien President Mamadou Tandja's statements denying the existence of a Tuareg rebellion in the north. Around this time, three older Tuareg men had been kidnapped and murdered by Nigerien soldiers several weeks prior to the attack, prompting anger in Tuareg communities.\nFifteen Nigerien soldiers were killed in the attack, and seventy-two were taken hostage, forty-three of whom were injured. Around a hundred MNJ rebels and Tuareg fighters participated in the attack. A captured Nigerien officer then led MNJ fighters to the grave of the three old men immediately following the attack. \n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the attack, the MNJ engaged in talks with the Red Cross in returning the injured Nigerien soldiers. The Nigerien government declared a state of emergency in August 2007 after MNJ attacks escalated in the region, especially around the Tchigozerine coal mine and uranium mining facilities owned by foreign companies.

        "content": "Gaia BH3 (Gaia DR3 4318465066420528000) is a binary system consisting of a metal-poor giant star with spectral type G and a stellar-mass black hole. Gaia BH3 is located 1926 light years away (590.6±5.8 pc away) in the constellation of Aquila, making it as of 2024 the heaviest known black hole system second-closest to Earth. Gaia BH3 is the first black hole discovered from preliminary Gaia DR4 astrometric data.\nThe black hole and star orbit the system barycentre every 11.6 years, with an orbital distance ranging from 4.5–29 AU. The black hole's mass is 32.70 M☉, the heaviest known stellar black hole in the Milky Way.\nThe black hole Gaia BH3 is together with Cygnus X-1 the only black hole more massive than about 10 M☉. The mass of Gaia BH3 is quite similar to the mass of merging binary black holes found via gravitational waves. These massive black holes were suspected to be formed by metal-poor stars and the fact that Gaia BH3 has a metal-poor companion strengthens this conclusion.\nGaia BH3 was found to be part of a disrupted star cluster of low mass and this star cluster is today a halo stellar stream, called ED-2. This stellar stream is very old, with an age comparable to the globular cluster Messier 92. This means that Gaia BH3 likely formed more than 13 billion years ago and the black hole might have formed via direct collapse of a massive star. Alternatively the black hole could have formed via binary interaction inside the star cluster. ED-2 has a mass between 2,000 M☉ and 42,000 M☉.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nGaia BH3 was originally found by astrometric observations with Gaia in 2015 and became a black hole binary candidate by the European Space Agency on 16 April, 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"The Strange Death of Captain America\" is a 1969 story arc written and illustrated by Jim Steranko that ran in Captain America, an American comic book series published by Marvel Comics. The story follows the superhero Captain America as he struggles with his lack of a secret identity, while taking on Rick Jones as his new sidekick and fending off the fascistic terrorist group Hydra under its new leader Madame Hydra.\nSteranko began working at Marvel in the late 1960s, having gained a profile as a popular illustrator and comic book artist on the basis of his avant-garde and surrealist art style. In developing his run on Captain America, Steranko sought to reverse what he saw as deviations from the World War II-era story formulas that had initially generated acclaim and popularity for the character. His run is distinguished by its use of a cinematically influenced aesthetic, characterized by heavy use of answering shots, pan and tracking sequences, dramatic lighting, and reaction inserts.\n\"The Strange Death of Captain America\" has been acclaimed by comics critics and creators. Despite its short length of only three issues and the later reversal of several of the changes made by Steranko to character's status quo, it is regarded as highly influential in the editorial history of Captain America, with scholars considering the story arc as transitional point from the character's origins as a patriotic wartime hero towards stories that were more responsive to the changing political realities of the post-war era.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt Avengers Mansion in New York City, the Hulk's sidekick Rick Jones finds the uniform of  Bucky Barnes, the deceased sidekick of Captain America. Jones dons the uniform and asks Captain America to make him his new sidekick, a request he rejects. Suddenly, they are alerted that the fascistic terrorist group Hydra is attacking the city's water's supply. Captain America defeats the Hydra henchmen with assistance from Jones, and he agrees to take Jones on as his new partner.\nLater, Captain America is ambushed by Hydra assassins under the command its new leader Madame Hydra while in the guise of Steve Rogers, his civilian identity; he reflects on how his lack of a secret identity exposes himself and his companions to danger. Shortly thereafter, Jones experiences a violent psychedelic hallucination after he picks up a letter from Hydra laced with a psychoactive gas intended for Captain America. In a confrontation between Captain America, Jones, and Hydra, Captain America is shot and falls into a river; only his shirt and a mask with Steve Rogers' facial features, both riddled with bullet holes, are recovered.\nThe revelation that Captain America is dead and that \"Steve Rogers\" was a false identity become public. A funeral held by the Avengers is attacked by Hydra, though Captain America suddenly appears to join the fight; in the ensuing conflict, Hydra is beaten back and Madame Hydra is killed. Captain America privately reveals to the Avengers that he is Steve Rogers, that his death was a ruse, and that as Captain America has returned while the public believes Steve Rogers to be dead, he once again has a secret identity.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Context ===\nCaptain America was revived as a standalone ongoing comic book in 1968, following a five-year period in which stories starring the title character were published in the anthology series Strange Tales. The revival was initially written and edited by Stan Lee with art by Captain America co-creator Jack Kirby, both of whom had authored stories featuring the character dating back to the 1940s. Many of the comics in Lee and Kirby's revivial of Captain America were referential to the character's roots as a patriotic wartime superhero; stories featured, for example, an Adolf Hitler impersonator and the Nazi villain Red Skull as antagonists.\nJim Steranko began working for Marvel in the late 1960s, after previously working at Harvey Comics as writer and illustrator for the comic Spyman under editor and Captain America co-creator Joe Simon. His first work at Marvel was as inker for the ongoing feature \"Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" in the anthology Strange Tales, which was also illustrated by Kirby; Steranko would later assume Kirby's role as illustrator for the series. By the time his run on Captain America began in 1969, Steranko had already achieved a high degree of acclaim and notability for his avant-garde art style, which draws inspiration from op art and artists associated with the surrealist movement such as Salvador Dalí.\n\n\n=== Production ===\n\nAfter publishing Captain America #109, which features a retelling of Captain America's origin story, Kirby departed as the regular artist for the series. Steranko requested and was given authorship of Captain America by Lee in part to resolve a dispute between the two: Steranko had quit \"Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" after Lee placed a fill-in issue in the middle of Steranko's run that Steranko felt had broken the series' continuity. Comics scholar Ben Saunders notes how Steranko's run on \"Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" had elevated that title from a \"second-tier strip into a fan favourite\", and that Lee \"clearly hoped that Steranko would bring a fresh feel to Captain America’s adventures, too\".\nSteranko sought to reestablish what he saw as \"the formula that had made [Captain America] a cultural icon\". To this end, he had three primary goals for his run: the first was to reestablish Captain America's secret identity, following his unmasking in Captain America #105 (1968). Steranko felt this decision had diminished \"the universal mystique once surrounding\" the character, and made him \"something less than the quintessential symbol of patriotism\". He also sought to resolve the character's ongoing guilt over the death of his wartime sidekick Bucky Barnes, and to introduce new villains who were more contemporary than the World War II-era adversaries the character continued to face. The former was resolved through the introduction of Rick Jones as the new Bucky – that the new Bucky would be Jones was a directive from Lee, according to Steranko – while the former was resolved through the addition of Hydra, who Steranko had previously used as villains in \"Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", to Captain America's rogues' gallery.\n\nIn developing the artwork for his run, Steranko traded the self-described \"zap art style\" he had used for \"Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" in favor of one he described as \"more expressive and sophisticated, more worthy of [Captain America's] historical eminence\". To this end, he developed a more cinematic aesthetic characterized by its use of answering shots, pan and tracking sequences, dramatic lighting, and reaction inserts. Steranko's art in general is highly referential, to both comics and other media: the climax of \"The Strange Death of Captain America\" is a reference to the story \"Spy Ambush\" from Captain America Comics #10 (1942), while Rick Jones' hallucination is influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1945 film Spellbound. Steranko used actor Burt Lancaster as reference for both the visual appearance and personality of Steve Rogers, stating that he drew the character as \"a living powerhouse\" by \"layering muscle on top of muscle\" to achieve anatomy that was \"realistic, yet of ultrahuman proportion\". Steranko also designed a new logo for the ongoing Captain America comic book.\nBeyond Steranko, creative staff for \"The Strange Death of Captain America\" included Joe Sinnott and Tom Palmer as inkers, and Sam Rosen  and Artie Simek as letterers. The centerspread in the run's final issue was penciled, inked, lettered, and colored by Steranko, and was the first time that Marvel had published a spread that had been fully illustrated and formatted in this manner by a single individual.\nCredit for authorship of \"The Strange Death of Captain America\" has been the subject of dispute. According to the Grand Comics Database, Steranko stated in a 1970 interview published in Fantastic Fanzine that he plotted the issues while the dialogue was written by Lee. Steranko has subsequently downplayed Lee's involvement and expressed frustration over not receiving full authorship credit for \"The Strange Death of Captain America\", as this has impacted his royalty payments for reprints of the story arc. Brian Cronin of Comic Book Resources notes that Lee is not credited as a writer of any of the issues in Steranko's run, and that Steranko has stated that he was paid a full writing credit for his issues of Captain America; Cronin hypothesized that Lee's direct role in the story was likely limited to dialogue adjustments. In 2015, Steranko stated in a post on Twitter that Marvel was now crediting him as the sole author of \"The Strange Death of Captain America\".\n\n\n=== Release ===\n\"The Strange Death of Captain America\" was originally published in Captain America issues #110 (February 1969), #111 (March 1969), and #113 (May 1969); Captain America #112 (April 1969) is a fill-in issue written by Lee and illustrated by Kirby, as Steranko missed the publication deadline. The series has been anthologized several times, notably as a Marvel Masterworks edition published in 2006, and as part of the Captain America volume of the Penguin Classics Marvel Collection published in 2022.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\n\"The Strange Death of Captain America\" has been acclaimed by comics critics and creators. In its commemoration of the story arc's fiftieth anniversary, the ArtCenter College of Design wrote that \"many still consider [it] the greatest Captain America story ever told, for both its story and its art\" and noted its reputation as \"a tour-de-force of [Steranko's] verbal and visual storytelling skills and talents that branded him the Jimi Hendrix of Comics\". Writer Ed Brubaker cited Steranko's run as an influence on his own run of Captain America, particularly his storyline \"The Winter Soldier\", and writer-producer Jeph Loeb described the run as \"one of the things that helped define what is is that I do\".\nOn its list of \"The Ten Essential Captain America Stories\", Comics Alliance ranked \"The Strange Death of Captain America\" first, commending its \"psychedelic visuals\" and calling its two-page spread artwork \"some of the greatest in comics history\". Screenrant listed Steranko's run second on its list of the \"10 Best Captain America Runs of All Time\", describing it as containing \"perhaps the most important comics in Cap's history\" and offering praise for its \"vivid, boundary-breaking style, with inventive layouts and pop-art psychedelia\".\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nLee would ultimately not maintain many of the changes introduced to Captain America by Steranko. Rick Jones departed Captain America to join up with Captain Mar-Vell in Captain Marvel #17 (October 1969), and Marvel's first African-American superhero Falcon was introduced as Captain America's new sidekick shortly thereafter; Madame Hydra would also be revived in Captain America #180 (December 1974) with the new name \"Viper\". Captain America's questioning of his place in the world as a 'man out of time' would quickly return as a recurring plot and thematic element of the series, contrasting Steranko's desire to position the character as a more iconoclastic and mythic figure.\nDespite these reversals and the general brevity of Steranko's run, \"The Strange Death of Captain America\" is nevertheless regarded as highly influential in the editorial history of Captain America. Comics scholar Ben Saunders writes that  its contemporary artwork belies its status as \"an essentially nostalgic approach to the character and concept\", representing \"the last serious effort to revive the World War II formula that first established the character as a national icon–the last attempt to present Captain America as an uncomplicated symbol of the American fighting spirit, without qualms or misgivings, and mercifully free of psychological trauma\". He writes that the ultimate abandonment of this formula \"reflects less upon [Steranko] than it does upon the historical transformation of American society in the years since the war\", and that subsequent changes such as the introduction of Falcon were a \"recognition that American society was continuing to evolve, and that Captain America needed to evolve with it, if he hoped to survive\".\nComics scholars Christopher Hayton and David Albright similarly argue that \"The Strange Death of Captain America\" was significant as a moment \"of transition and uncertainty\" for Captain America, as the character moved from his origins as a patriotic wartime hero to one who represented \"the dichotomy that was developing in public consciousness between American ideals and American practice\". Subsequent Captain America stories, such as \"Secret Empire\" (1974), would address this dichotomy directly.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nStewart, Alan (November 4, 2018). \"Captain America #110\".

        "content": "Elizabeth \"Goody\" Garlick was a resident of East Hampton, Long Island, who was accused of witchcraft in 1657. Her case is a significant one in the history of witchcraft accusations in North America, predating the more famous Salem witch trials by several decades. The accusation stemmed from the death of 16-year-old Elizabeth Howell, the daughter of prominent citizen Lion Gardiner and wife of prominent resident Arthur Howell.\nIn February, 1658, 16-year old Elizabeth Gardiner Howell, who had recently given birth to a child, fell ill. During the illness, Elizabeth reportedly suffered from nightmares and claimed she saw a \"black thing at the bed's feet\" and that Garlick stood by her bed at night “ready to pull me in pieces.” As friends ministered to her, she was reported to have shrieked in hysteria: \"A witch! A witch! Now you are come to torture me because I spoke two or three words against you!”Following Elizabeth's death, local magistrates launched an investigation. Several of Goody Garlick's other accusers claimed that she employed black magic to harm people and livestock. Garlick was also accused of performing “works above the course of nature to the loss of lives of several persons.” Goodwives Edwards and Davis blamed Garlick for causing their children to fall ill, while additional witnesses attributed the death of two other children to her malignant power.In the spring of 1658, Elizabeth Garlick traveled from her home on Long Island (which was under Connecticut’s jurisdiction at the time), to stand trial in Hartford for witchcraft. The record of the trial—on May 5, 1658, about three months after Elizabeth Gardiner Howell’s death—is brief. Goody Davis testified that Garlick was responsible for the death of one of her children. However, during the trial both Jeremiah and Katherine Vaile, servents of Lion Gardiner, challenged her assertion, reporting that they heard the Gardiner say that “Goody Davis had taken an Indian child to nurse & for lucre [profit] of a little wampum [valuable shell beads] had merely starved her own child.” The court was headed by Connecticut Governor John Winthrop the Younger, and the indictment was severe: “Elizabeth Garlick…that not having the fear of God before thine eyes thou hast entertained familiarity with Satan the great enemy of God and mankind, and by his help since the year 1650 have done works above the course of nature to the loss of lives of several persons (with several other sorceries) and in particular the wife of Arthur Howell of East Hampton, for which both according to the laws of God and the established law of this commonwealth thou deserveth to die.”After hearing testimony, the jury reached a verdict of not guilty, and the court duly released her from custody. Her husband, however, had to enter a bond of thirty pounds to ensure that he and his wife would “carry good behavior to all the members of this jurisdiction” and appear before the next court held at Easthampton, so it could confirm that  Garlick had not been a source of disorder. Though her date of death was not recorded in local records, Elizabeth Garlick was buried at the South End Burying Ground in East Hampton.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A Difficult Game About Climbing is a 2024 indie climbing video game and rage game produced by solo developer Ponypants in the Unity engine and inspired by the gameplay of Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nTaking inspiration from other rage games like Getting Over It, Only Up!, Pogostuck, and Jump King, the primary objective is climbing through a themed platforming obstacle course to the top of a mountain. What sets A Difficult Game About Climbing apart is its unique movement style, where mouse or joystick input directs force vectors applied to the player character's arms through Unity's physics simulation tools. This behavior is somewhat similar to Getting Over It's hammer or the manual leg controls of QWOP. Restricting movement to the character's two arms and hands limits traversal to what is possible with only two points of contact, but gaps can be crossed by swinging to create momentum.\nBodies of water are used as a checkpoint system when players fall. Each new game area or level is associated with a new body of water, so falls resulting from failing platforming challenges do not return players to the beginning of the game, but the beginning of the area.\n\n\n== Development ==\nPontypants released a dev log on Youtube on March 6, 2024, discussing the process of building out the physics, gameplay, sound design, and map design of the game. Prototyping began in Godot before migrating to Unity.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game performed well on the Steam charts immediately on release. Like with other rage games, A Difficult Game About Climbing became popular during a window on release as a livestreaming and Let's Play title on sites like Twitch and YouTube. It also begame a popular game to speedrun.\nSteven V. Santos gave a score of 70/100 for Game8.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Isis was an encyclopedic journal that focused on articles on natural science, medicine, technology, economics as well as art and history. It also published important articles on science policy and the organization of science. Edited by Lorenz Oken and published by Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus, Isis was the first interdisciplinary journal in the German-speaking world.\nThe 41 volumes of the journal named after the Egyptian goddess Isis were nominally published from 1817 to 1848. However, the first issue appeared on August 1, 1816, while the printing of the last issue was delayed until February 1850. Until 1832, Isis bore the title Encyclopädische Zeitung. After the focus of the articles published in it had changed, Oken changed the title to Encyclopädische Zeitschrift, vorzüglich für Naturgeschichte, vergleichende Anatomie und Physiologie in 1833. Initially printed in Jena, the journal was banned in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and from the summer of 1819 was produced in nearby Rudolstadt in the court printing works of the Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. The magazine's original print run of 1,500 copies fell rapidly in the first few years of its existence and amounted to around 200 copies in the last few years.\nOriginally conceived as a non-political journal, Oken was forced to vehemently defend the freedom of the press in the first years of Isis' existence. This resulted in numerous lawsuits against Oken, some of which overlapped in time, which led to temporary bans on Isis in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. In the run-up to the Carlsbad Decrees, this led to Oken's dismissal as a professor at the University of Jena at the end of June 1819 under pressure from the states of the Holy Alliance.\nFrom 2006 to 2013, a project funded by the German Research Foundation at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena studied the significance of Isis for scientific communication and the popularization of the natural sciences in the first half of the 19th century.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nIn a letter dated April 11, 1814, Lorenz Oken contacted the publisher Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus for the first time and offered him his publication Neue Bewaffnung, neues Frankreich, neues Theutschland for printing. Brockhaus did not print it, but Oken subsequently contributed to Brockhaus' Conversations-Lexikon and, from June 1815 at the latest, was a contributor to the Deutsche Blätter, which Brockhaus had been publishing since October 1813 following the Battle of Leipzig and which became the most important journal in central Germany in 1813/1814. Presumably at the end of June/beginning of July 1815, Oken took over the editorship of the Tagesgeschichte, a supplement to the Deutsche Blätter, which was dedicated to daily politics and for which he wrote and edited numbers 1 to 16. With the end of the Wars of Liberation, the focus of the Deutsche Blätter shifted from war reporting to general daily politics, which was associated with a considerable decline in circulation from an initial 4000 to 1100 copies. On February 22, 1816, Brockhaus announced that he would discontinue the Deutsche Blätter. Oken regretted this decision and repeatedly urged Brockhaus to continue the Deutsche Blätter in another form. He presented Brockhaus with his encyclopedic concept of a new journal, which would not focus on current politics, but on the natural sciences, critique, history and political science. Brockhaus was only to bear the printing and postage costs. The first publishing contract for the Encyclopädische Blätter was signed with Brockhaus on March 31, 1816. Oken presented his concept to readers in the last issue of Deutsche Blätter.\n\n\n== Conception ==\nThe design concept for Isis was delayed until July 1816, as Oken was still working on the zoological section of his textbook on natural history. Oken reached an agreement with Brockhaus that a copper plate should appear in each booklet, and he worked towards a low sales price. They were at odds over the arrangement of the information in the title head and the text and image design. Oken had a woodcut made for the title head, in the middle of which the goddess Isis is depicted on an ancient Egyptian throne. On the left, she is flanked by her husband Osiris, who carries a vulture's head and a staff. To her right is Anubis with a jackal's head, palm branch and snake sceptre. Oken commissioned the rector of the Academy of Fine Arts Leipzig, Veit Schnorr von Carolsfeld (1764–1841), to create the frontispiece and later copper plates. There were differences of opinion as to whether foreign-language contributions should be translated into German. Oken spoke out against it due to the difficulty of translating certain technical terms. Brockhaus was in favour of a translation for reasons of popularization.\nThe title Isis first appeared in correspondence between Oken and Brockhaus at the end of July, shortly before the first issue went to press. The two agreed on Encyclopädische Zeitung as the additional title, in line with the originally intended title of the journal. Oken sent the draft of the first edition, produced by the printer Johann Georg Schreiber in Jena, to Brockhaus' publishing house in Altenburg on July 13, 1816, with the remark that it was to be published in a new edition. Oken introduced this first issue of Isis, which appeared on August 1, 1816, with an excerpt from the Basic Law on the State Constitution of the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. In it, he presented the programmatic orientation of his new journal. Isis was to cover natural sciences, medicine, mathematics, technology, economics, art and history. Law and theology were expressly excluded. Oken wrote \"That is why history is the mirror of this journal, nature its floor, art its pillar wall. We leave the sky open.\" Anyone could send articles to Isis for publication. Oken did not pay a fee for published articles.\n\n\n== Oken's fight for freedom of expression and the press ==\n\n\n=== Legal dispute with Eichstädt ===\n\nEven before Isis was published, the classical philologist Abraham Eichstädt from Jena learned of the planned new journal. Eichstädt, who published the Jenaische allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, had held an exclusive right to publish reviews in Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach since 1803. As he feared for the financial security of his paper, Eichstädt turned to the President of the State Ministry in Weimar, Christian Gottlob Voigt, and obtained a renewal of this privilege on July 17, 1816. Oken saw this as a violation of the freedom of the press guaranteed in the Weimar Constitution of May 15, 1816 and sneered in the second issue of Isis: \"Whether we really have freedom of the press, or whether it is to be mocked as a grimace through literary privileges and arbitrary interpretation and extension of the same, will be taught by the progress of Isis.\" Eichstädt filed a lawsuit against Oken and Isis on August 1, 1816. In a judgment dated August 23, Oken was ordered to refrain from publishing reviews and political articles. In the event of non-compliance, he was threatened with a fine of 50 thalers and a ban on Isis. Oken, who became aware of the verdict eight days later, protested against it to the Weimar government on September 2 and attached the first five issues of Isis to his letter in support of his position. In the course of September 1816, the verdict against Oken and Isis was finally withdrawn. Looking ahead, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe commented on the events in his diary on July 30, 1816, with the remark: \"Isis as Hydra.\"\n\n\n=== Goethe's recommendation for a ban ===\nIn order not to exacerbate the disputes with Eichstädt, Oken had filled the first four issues exclusively with scientific topics and suggested to Brockhaus that he initially refrain from including controversial political articles, as political newspapers in the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach were still subject to censorship. However, Brockhaus did not agree to this and delayed the delivery of the first four issues. As the dispute with Eichstädt progressed, Oken finally felt compelled to include political topics in Isis. In the sixth issue of Isis, he placed a prize issue in which he questioned the legitimacy of literary privileges. In the ninth issue and the two following issues, Oken criticized the Basic Law on the Landständische Verfassung des Großherzogthums Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach, which came into force on 5 May 1816. In the third issue of Isis, Oken also printed a letter dated December 5, 1811, from the Rostock professors Samuel Gottlieb Vogel, Wilhelm Josephi, Georg Heinrich Masius (1771–1823) and Karl Ernst Theodor Brandenburg (1772–1827), in which they rejected Oken's appointment to the vacant chair of natural history at the University of Rostock due to his pompous natural philosophy. Oken illustrated the print with a vignette depicting donkey heads.\nOn September 10, 1816, Christian Gottlob von Voigt drew up an indictment in response to these Isis editions. Oken was accused of insulting the highest royal dignity of the sovereign, insulting official dignity, attacking some German governments and their rulers, as well as insulting foreign official authorities and the Rostock professors. A week later, Grand Duke Karl August sent the indictment to the State Directorate for examination. The expert opinions written by Anton Ziegesar (1783–1843), the head of the administrative and police authority Karl Wilhelm von Fritsch, and the head of the school and church system Ernst Christian August von Gersdorff were collected together with the first eleven issues of Isis in a file entitled Acta Geheimer Staats-Canzley Den Unfug der Preßfrechheit besonders der Isis betr. 1816.\nGrand Duke Carl August sent this file to Goethe at the end of September and asked him for his judgment. As can be seen from his diary notes, Goethe needed several days to consider the matter of Isis. In his reply of 5 October, Goethe recommended to the Grand Duke not to prosecute Oken personally, but to take action against the printer of Isis and thus enforce a ban on printing the journal. Carl August did not follow Goethe's advice, but instead discontinued the prosecution.\n\n\n=== The Wartburgfest and the confiscated number 195 of Isis ===\n\nBefore the end of 1816, Isis was banned in Austria. Meanwhile, Oken continued to campaign for freedom of the press and, for example, published a report on the meeting of the Dutch estates under the title \"Against the Restriction of Freedom of the Press\". In June 1817, the Prussian Minister of Police, Wilhelm Ludwig Georg Fürst zu Wittgenstein, complained to Carl August about a derogatory criticism of a Prussian decree of 1811 that had appeared in the Oppositions-Blatt and a small note in Isis, in which Oken complained about Prussia's presumption in wanting to interfere even in insignificant matters such as those of the Vienna Agricultural Society. Six days later, a serious warning was issued to the editor of the opposition journal Friedrich Justin Bertuch and Oken, stating \"that in the event of further disregard of the sovereign's or authorities' orders, the suppression of this journal will be pursued\".\nDuring the Wartburg Festival, which Oken and other professors from Jena attended, an auto-da-fé took place on the evening of October 18, 1817, during which parts of a Prussian Uhlan uniform, a Hessian soldier's braid and an Austrian corporal's baton, as well as several books by authors considered reactionary, including Karl Albert von Kamptz, Theodor Schmalz, Karl Ludwig von Haller and August von Kotzebue, were burned. Fourteen days later, Oken published a report on the meeting at Wartburg Castle, which also contained a list of the burned books and objects, along with mocking signs.\nKamptz, the head of the Ministry of Police in Berlin, whose Codex der Gensd'armerie was one of the burned books, railed in a letter dated November 9, 1817 to Grand Duke Carl August about the \"bunch of feral professors and seduced students\" and went on to write: \"If true freedom of thought and freedom of the press really flourishes in Your Royal Highness's states, then censorship practiced by fire and pitchforks, by enthusiasts and minors, and terrorist proceedings against freedom of thought and freedom of the press in other states are certainly not compatible with this.\" The following day, a report by Weimar State Minister Karl Wilhelm von Fritsch exonerated Oken and the other professors, stating that they had not taken part in the burning. Nevertheless, on November 27, 1817, number 195 was confiscated and a temporary ban on the printing of Isis was issued, which was lifted on December 15. From December 2 onwards, a commission consisting of members of the Weimar state government investigated the Isis incidents. Oken was interrogated several times in Weimar. The commission submitted its report to the state government on December 20. The government was willing to return the confiscated copies of Isis if the disputed passages were removed. Oken did not agree to this deal. On January 24, 1818, Oken was sentenced to six weeks in prison for \"offenses against the highest dignity of the sovereign, offenses against the official dignity of the upper state authorities and the academic senate in Jena, denigration of German rulers and governments and insulting foreign official authorities\". Together with his statement published by the Bremer Zeitung at the end of March 1818, Oken had the sentence printed in full in Isis. Oken appealed against the sentence to the Jena High Court of Appeal and was acquitted on April 29, 1818.\n\n\n=== The August von Kotzebue incident ===\nThrough an indiscretion, the history professor Heinrich Luden from Jena came into possession of one of the numerous bulletins written by the Russian consul general Kotzebue and intended for Tsar Alexander I in mid-December 1817. He wrote a biting commentary on it for the journal Nemesis, although Kotzebue was able to prevent its publication and dissemination by court order on January 15, 1818. Oken nevertheless published Luden's article in the first issue of Isis in 1818. After the issue was published, the remaining copies were confiscated. Isis was banned again on January 31, 1818, and was not published again until the end of April. Both Luden and Oken were sentenced to three months imprisonment and a fine of 60 thalers by the Königlich Sächsischen Schöppengericht in Leipzig. Oken chose the fine and again published the files relating to the trial in Isis. On March 23, 1819, Kotzebue was murdered in Mannheim by the Jena fraternity member and theology student Karl Ludwig Sand.\n\n\n=== Oken's dismissal ===\nThe attacks against Oken's Isis from the states of the Holy Alliance continued relentlessly. On January 29, 1819, Karl August von Hardenberg submitted a complaint to Grand Duke Karl August because of a derisive remark about the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III, which was printed in the twelfth issue of 1818, but this time without consequences for Oken and Isis.\nAt the Aachen Congress in the fall of 1818, the Russian Tsar Alexander I distributed an anonymously written memorandum by Alexander Scarlatovich Sturdsa (1791–1854) entitled Memoire sur l'état actuel de l'Allemagne, in which Sturdsa commented on the dangerous activities at German universities. Oken's replies again caused a sensation. Under pressure from the Russian envoy to the Saxon court, Vasily Vasilyevich Chanykov (1759–1829), the Weimar state treasurer Carl August Constantin Schnauss (1782–1832) was forced to file charges against Oken on April 20, 1819. On May 11, Grand Duke Carl August of Weimar and Duke August of Gotha instructed the Senate of the University of Jena to give Oken the choice of either discontinuing Isis or resigning his professorship. The Senate tried to give in, but had to present Oken with this choice eleven days later. After three days of deliberation, Oken responded evasively: \"I have no answer to the request made to me. Perhaps they have come to a different conclusion that an answer is unnecessary.\" In its reply to the dukes, the Senate once again referred to Oken's outstanding reputation as a teacher and researcher, but to no avail. On June 1, 1819, Duke Carl Friedrich ordered Oken's dismissal and the withholding of his salary from June 15 onwards in the name and on behalf of his father. A similar order from the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg followed six days later. On June 26, 1818, the printing of Isis was provisionally banned.\nTo avoid the ban, Oken moved the printing of Isis to nearby Rudolstadt in the Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. There, Carl Popo Fröbel (1786–1824), stepbrother of the educator Friedrich Fröbel and owner of the court printing works since 1815, took over the printing of Isis from August 1819. After Fröbel's death in 1824, the print shop was initially taken over by Fröbel's widow and finally continued by his son Günther Fröbel from 1832, who produced the last issues of Isis in 1850. A small part of Isis was produced in Eisenberg until 1824/25.\nAfter the Carlsbad Decrees of September 1819, it became increasingly difficult to deal with political issues. Their share of articles in Isis fell sharply. After Brockhaus' death, Oken announced in the first issue of 1824 that Isis would no longer print political articles.\n\n\n== Content ==\nIn addition to Oken, many natural scientists and humanities scholars, writers and artists contributed to the content of Isis. Among the authors who published articles in the first volume of Isis were Alexander von Humboldt, Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, Madame de Staël, August Wilhelm Schlegel, Georges Cuvier and Johannes Peter Müller. There were reviews of Goethe's Aus meinem Leben. Dichtung und Wahrheit, Luigi Valentino Brugnatelli's (1761–1818) Kreistafel der chemischen Aequivalente, Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck's System der Pilze und Schwämme, Leopoldo Cicognara's (1767–1834) Von den vier venetianischen Kunstpferden, Charles Robert Cockerell's Ueber die ursprüngliche Anwendung der Niobe und ihrer Kinder and Ludwig Wachler's Deutschlands Zukunft in der Gegenwart. Isis reported on the state of affairs at German universities, published their course catalogs and also regularly set prizes.\nFrom the outset, Isis devoted considerable space to summaries and abstracts of publications published in foreign scientific and academic journals. Initially, the relevant journals came from the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Switzerland. These were later supplemented by journals from Scandinavia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Russia and the United States. Oken's approach to editing the articles varied greatly. Sometimes Oken's texts consisted of an abridged translation of the corresponding article, usually they summarized its main content in one paragraph. As a rule, the majority of the articles were only listed with their title - usually translated into German.\nIn 1821, Oken published the first call for an assembly of German naturalists in Isis, which led to the founding of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians in September 1822. Detailed reports on the society's annual meetings were published regularly until the end.\nFrom 1833, Isis bore the new title Encyclopädische Zeitschrift, vorzüglich für Naturgeschichte, vergleichende Anatomie und Physiologie. This change reflected the changing focus of the articles over time. The already small number of articles dealing with mathematics and physics decreased further.\nIn the last volume of 1848, Christian Ludwig Brehm published original articles in Isis with Ueber das allmählige Fortrücken der Vögel, Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Siedhofs (1803 - ca. 1867) with Naturgeschichtliches aus den Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerica, Johann Jakob Kaup with Uebersicht der Eulen (Strigidae) and Christian Gottfried Giebel with Das subhercynische Becken um Quedlinburg in geognostisch-paläontologischer Beziehung. Some of the publications discussed in this volume were Sebastian Egger's (1803–1866) Ueber die Pflichten gegen die Thiere, Franz von Kobell's Mineralogie, Christian Gottfried Giebel's Fauna der Vorwelt, Mauro Rusconi's (1776–1849) Riflessioni sopra il sistema linfatico dei rettili, Johann Malfatti's Neue Heilversuche, Karl Bernhard Stark's Kunst und Schule and Joseph Hippolyt Pultes (1805–1869) Organon der Weltgeschichte.\nIn the last edition, Oken ended Isis with the words: \"This is the end of Isis.\"\n\n\n== Circulation ==\nIn the initial period from August 1816 to February 1817, the circulation of Isis, which cost eight thalers a year, was 1500 copies. On March 4, 1817, Brockhaus reduced the print run to 1100 copies due to a lack of sales and reduced it by a further 100 copies a week later. When the actual sales figures were known in June 1817, there was a further drastic reduction of 650 copies. In 1825/1826, only 400 copies were printed. This was followed by a slight increase to up to 500 copies for the next few years until 1830. After that, the circulation fell continuously and was around 200 copies in the last ten years of Isis' existence. This relatively low circulation was nothing unusual. For example, the circulation of the Jahrbücher für wissenschaftliche Kritik, one of the most important journals for scientific reviews, was around 500 copies in the years from 1827 to 1846 and that of the Medizinische Annalen, edited by Johann Friedrich Pierer, was 500 to 700 copies.\n\n\n== Research ==\nIn 2001, the German historian of science Dietrich von Engelhardt characterized Isis as \"a first-rate scientific and cultural-historical document from that transitional epoch from idealism and romanticism to positivism and realism\", the analysis of which was still pending. Since 2006, the Institute for the History of Medicine, Natural Science and Technology at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, headed by Olaf Breidbach, has been investigating the significance of Isis for scientific communication and the popularization of the natural sciences in the first half of the 19th century, as well as its economic structure, in a project funded by the German Research Foundation. In a three-year project that began in July 2006, Claudia Taszus initially focused on the company documents found in the Fröbel court printing works. This was followed in 2009 by a project aimed at cataloguing the correspondence between Oken and the Brockhaus publishing house. The activities funded by the German Research Foundation also include the project carried out by the Thuringian University and State Library and the Ereignis Weimar-Jena. Kultur um 1800 at the University of Jena, the digitization, indexing and online presentation of Isis.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Articles in Isis ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBrockhaus, Heinrich Eduard, ed.

        "content": "Abidine Guindo is a Malian colonel and the former commander of the 33rd Parachute Commando Regiment. He participated in and led the failed counter-coup attempt against Amadou Haya Sanogo in April 2012.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGuindo was born in Mopti Region, and joined the 33rd Parachute Commando Regiment in 1975. As a 2nd class soldier in the Malian Army, he met Amadou Toumani Touré (ATT) in the late 1970s. In 1979, he was appointed as the jump instructor. Guindo later became one of ATT's most trusted companions, and was one of the eleven paratroopers responsible for the arrest of Moussa Traoré during the 1991 Malian coup d'état. The coup restored multi-party democracy in Mali, and Guindo subsequently became ATT's military second-in-command during the 1990s.Guindo became commander of the 33rd Regiment following ATT's victory in the 2002 Malian presidential election. At the start of the Mali War in 2012, Guindo and the 33rd fought Tuareg rebels in northern Mali, but quickly retreated south. Guindo was also present at the 2012 Malian coup d'état that overthrew ATT and installed Amadou Haya Sanogo. There are differing accounts to Guindo's role in the 2012 coup; some state he was responsible for ATT's extraction while another source states Guindo advised ATT to surrender to the mutineers.In late April 2012, Guindo was summoned to the Soundiata-Keita military camp in Kati by Sanogo. Guindo, fearing for his safety, put the 33rd Regiment on alert. Guindo launched a counter-coup attempt on April 30, but it had failed by the following day. He then fled into hiding, but was arrested by Sanogo's Malian Army on July 11, 2012. Guindo was released on November 9, 2013, as part of reconciliation measures between the 33rd regiment and Sanogo's troops. On February 20, 2018, Guindo was charged with \"undermining the internal security of the state and illegal use of weapons\" in regards to the counter-coup attempt.Guindo's son Aidine Guindo, a lieutenant in the Malian Army, died in November 2017 during a jihadist attack in Niafunké. Guindo's adopted son Boubacar Mamadou Guindo, a sergeant, committed suicide on March 13, 2019.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "MV Behshad is an Iran-flagged general cargo ship built in 1999 and owned by the Iranian company Rahbaran Omid Darya Ship Management Company. She is suspected of serving as a command post and spy ship for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and a front for the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. For these reasons, she has been sanctioned by the United States Treasury. During the Red Sea crisis, she has been suspected of acting as a reconnaissance vessel for the Houthis in their attacks against shipping in the Red Sea and surrounding waters. \n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nBehshad is a general cargo vessel which sails under the flag of Iran, with her home port being Qeshm. She has a length overall of 174 metres (571 ft), a width of 26 metres (85 ft), and a height of 13.9 metres (46 ft). Her gross tonnage (GT) is 16,694 and her deadweight tonnage (DWT) is 23,176 tons. She has previously sailed under the names of Bianca in 2012, Magnolia in 2011, Sea Flower and Limnetic in 2008, and Iran Seestan in 1999. She uses a diesel engine that supplies 9,480 kW (12,889 hp) of power. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction and management ===\nBehshad was built in 1999 by Guangzhou Shipyard International. Currently, she is registered as a merchant vessel under the Rahbaran Omid Darya Ship Management Company. \n\n\n=== Usage by Iran ===\nIn 2018, Behshad and MV Saviz, another Iranian spy ship registered as a cargo vessel, were sanctioned by the United States under the Donald Trump administration following the withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. \nIn 2021, she garnered media attention after she replaced Saviz in the Red Sea. Saviz had been patrolling the Bab-el-Mandeb strait since 2016, but was damaged by a suspected Israeli limpet mine attack in April 2021. She was towed away by two tugboats just days before Behshad arrived. In early July, Behshad left the port of Bandar Abbas. Nine days later, she arrived at the Bab-el-Mandeb, according to satellite images obtained by CNN. She has operated in the lower Red Sea, close to the strait, until early January 2024. \n\n\n=== Red Sea crisis ===\n\nOn 19 November 2023, Houthi rebels boarded and hijacked the Israeli-owned Galaxy Leader cargo ship in an operation allegedly led by Quds Force commander Abdolreza Shahlaei. Behshad allegedly played a role in locating the vessel and disclosing it to the Houthis, as her automatic identification system (AIS) was turned off after passing Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. She is also suspected of coordinating the missile strike on the Marlin Luanda, a Marshall Islands-flagged vessel owned by the British company Oceonix, and there have been speculations that she was involved in the fatal attack on the MV True Confidence that killed three of its crewmembers, since she was only 43 nautical miles (80 km; 49 mi) away from the site the vessel was struck. \nOn 22 December 2023, the Wall Street Journal published a report that Behshad had been responsible for directing Houthi attacks on commercial vessels. The report said that she provides the Houthis with real-time intelligence, allowing them to locate and attack vessels which have made attempts to avoid detection. \nIn early January 2024, Behshad relocated from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. This occurred around the same time the Houthis began to shift their attacks towards the same region. In early February, she once again relocated, this time docking at a port in Djibouti, around 3 nautical miles (5.6 km; 3.5 mi) from the Chinese naval base. Around this time, the frequency of Houthi attacks began to decrease significantly.\n\n\n=== Cyberattack ===\nOn 28 January, Iran-backed militants carried out a drone attack on Tower 22, a US outpost in Jordan, killing three service members. As part of the United States' response to the attack, they conducted a cyberattack against Behshad. It came despite Iranian warnings not to target the ship. The attack was carried out in an attempt to hinder Iran's ability to contact and provide intelligence to the Houthis, according to US officials. Following the attack, she temporarily left the area she normally patrolled, but later returned.\n\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\nOn 18 April 2024, after nearly three years at sea, Behshad began to voyage back to Bandar Abbas. According to AIS data provided by the marine tracking website MarineTraffic, she crossed into the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Gulf in the early morning and began to move towards the port of Bandar Abbas. Analysts said that the ship was a high-profile target for Israeli strikes, and her withdrawal came as Israel weighed how it would respond to Iranian attacks on its soil.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n\n=== Usage ===\nDespite Iran denying the ship's usage for military purposes and insisting that it is used to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia, analysts have concluded that Behshad has connections to the IRGC and its proxy groups. \nMichael Knights, a journalist for the think tank Washington Institute for Near East Policy who focuses on Iran and its proxies, has concluded that Behshad and Saviz disguise themselves as anti-piracy garrisons that can be visited by Iranian and Syrian shipping, but are actually used for the shipment of Iranian weaponry, and that military trainers for Hezbollah could also use them. He added that the vessels are equipped with electronic intelligence that is passed to the Houthis in order to assist them in locating vessels. \nJon Gahagan, the president of the maritime risk-based website Sedna Global, said that it is unusual for a cargo vessel to move in the way of Beshad while being registered and flagged in Iran. He asked about the vessel, \"If she isn't providing the Houthi regime with intelligence on vessel movements, then just what is she doing?\" \n\n\n=== Movement and location ===\nBehshad's AIS tracker has shown her move in erratic courses in the Gulf of Aden, in what have been described as \"patrol boxes\". According to MariTrace, the vessel had been on standby 100 kilometres (62 mi) east of the port of Djibouti from 11 January to 3 February 2024, when she anchored close to the Chinese military base there. Military analysts suspect that the vessel was placed there to discourage US forces from attacking or boarding her. \nAccording to an analysis by NBC News and other experts, the vessel has been present at a distance of several miles away during Houthi attacks on commercial vessels.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "George Borlase Childs (11 August 1857 - 4 March 1909) was a Church of England vicar and association footballer who played in the 1880 FA Cup final.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nChilds was the third son of Thomas Cave Childs, a clergyman from Nympton St George.  He was educated at Forest School, one of the earliest and most fervent hotbeds of the association game, and represented the school side in matches against adult sides from 1872.In 1876 he went up to Magdalen College, Oxford on a demyship, and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1880.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nForest School entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1875–76, and Childs captained the side in its first round tie with Oxford University, played at the Kennington Oval, which the university side won 6–0.  He also played for the Essex representative side in a 1–1 draw against Surrey, also at the Oval, in February 1876.Having gone up to Oxford, he did not break into the university first XI until the 1878–79 season, and was in \"rare form\" in the first round of the 1878–79 FA Cup hammering of Wednesbury Strollers, although he did not score.  He did however score twice in Oxford's second round win over the Royal Engineers.Childs played in every round of the 1879–80 FA Cup, switching from his usual right-side to the left-side of the forward line for the 1–0 win over Maidenhead in the fourth round, and he captained the side in the semi-final against the Royal Engineers.  He also scored the winning goal in the semi-final against Nottingham Forest, following up a Francis Crowdy shot which had only been parried.  However Oxford lost the final 1–0 to Clapham Rovers, Childs twice coming close to scoring, one shot going just wide and another being well saved by Reginald Birkett.As he graduated in 1880, he was no longer eligible to play for Oxford University, and joined the Swifts of Slough for the 1880–81 FA Cup, playing as a left- and right-sided forward in each of the Birds' two ties.  In the 1881–82 FA Cup he played for the Old Foresters in their quarter-final replay defeat to Great Marlow at the Swifts' Dolphin Ground; it was his final recorded match.\n\n\n== Representative matches ==\nHe came close to representing England in international football; he was selected to play as a right-sided forward on 1 March 1879 fixture against Scotland at the Kennington Oval, but the match was postponed due to frost, and he was not chosen for the re-arranged fixture, replaced by Arthur Goodyer.  He did however represent the London Football Association against the Birmingham Football Association in the \"mini-international\" in February 1880, played before a crowd of 10,000 at the Aston Lower Grounds; Childs scored the opening goal of the match, but the Birmingham FA ran out 5–2 winners.He obtained his blue by playing in the Varsity match in 1879 and 1880, both of which Cambridge University won - Oxford was particularly unlucky in the timing of the latter as the match fell between the original semi-final and replay against the Royal Engineers in the Cup.\n\n\n== Post-football career ==\nHe was ordained in 1881, and was curate of St. Mary-the-less, Lambeth, and York Town, Surrey, until 1885.  He performed missionary work in Canada from 1886 to 1890.  In 1891, after his return to England, he was appointed as secretary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in the dioceses of Lichfield and Chester.  He was curate of Christ Church, Reading, Berkshire, in 1896–97, of Holy Trinity, East Finchley, from 1897 to 1900, and of St. Paul, Haringey, in 1901–2.He died on 4 March 1909, at Brook House, Upper Clapton; he had been living in Deal, Kent at the time.  His estate was left to his younger brother Charles.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Al-Ajrad is a mountain located in the northwest of Medina, about 90 kilometers from it, to the northeast of Yanbu, about 100 kilometers from it. Buwat Valley is located below it. It is called Al-Ajrad (hairless) because it is stripped of vegetation and has few trees, which is the opposite of the Al-Ashaar (hairy), which is dotted with trees.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAl-Ajrad is one of Juhaynah's two mountains, Al-Ajrad and Al-Ashaar. Now inhabited by the Juhaynah tribe, the two mountains form a mountain range with a height of about 1280 meters, which is located west of the city and Radwa Mountain. The waters of Al-Ajrad flow into Al Hemed Valley from the north. The mountain was mentioned in Muhammed's hadith, on the authority of Abdullah ibn Salman al-Aghar, on the authority of Nafi, from Abdullah ibn Umar, that Muhammed said: \"If temptations arise, you should go to the two mountains of Juhaynah\". Abu Ali al-Hijri said: I found the description of the two mountains, Al-Ashaar and Al-Ajrad, the two mountains of Juhaynah, I quoted it for the hadith that Muhammad talked regarding safety in the temptations. It is mentioned in Al-Tabqaqat al-Kubra book: \"For the two mountains of Juhaynah, Al-Ashaar, and Al-Ajrad, they are two mountains of paradise that will not be touched by temptations\".\n\n\n== What historians have mentioned ==\nAl-Bakri al-Andalusi said: Al-Ajrad is one of the two mountains of Juhaynah, and the other is Al-Ashaar, after which their valleys are named. Al-Ajrad comes after Buwat Al-Gelasi, and there are two valleys in Buwat. From the valleys of Al-Ajrud that flow in Al-Gelasi: Mabkatha, which is in front of Buwat valley. Mabkatha is followed by Rashad, which flows into Edam, it was named Ghawa, according to Juhaynah, so Muhammad named it Rashad, and it is for the tribe of Dinar, the brothers of Al-Rabaa. After Rashad is Alhadera, which has the tomb of Abdulaziz ibn Muhammad ibn Abdulaziz ibn Umar ibn Abdulrahman ibn Awf, and also a water spring. Albaly is down streaming on Alhadera, where there are also palm trees, and it belonged to Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Allahabi, then next to Alhadera is Taborz, which has small springs:  A spring belonging to Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Imran al-Talhi, called Alazanbah, Al Dhaleel of Mubarak Al Turki, and other springs that dissipate in the mountain. From the valleys of Al-Ajrad that flow into Al-Ghor is Hazar, and it is for Gasham tribe, and Rahet for Malek tribe, which Abu Dhu'ayb says about it: \" It was the crown of people of Hazar and the waters of Juhaynah at Al-Ajrad: The well of Bani Sabaa, and the well of Hawatka, which in Zaqab Al-Shatan, and was mentioned by Ktheir. And it is in between the spring of Hashim tribe, which is in Malal, and the spring in Edam.\nAl-Askandari said: Al-Ashaar and Al-Ajrad are two mountains of Juhaynah between Medina and the Levant.\nYaqut al-Hamawi said: A place where there is no vegetation. On the authority of Abu al-Qasim Mahmud, on the authority of Sayyid Ali al-Alawi, he has a mention in the hadith of Hijrah from Muhammad ibn Ishaq. Also, Nasr said: Al-Ashaar and Al-Ajrad are two mountains of Juhaynah between Medina and the Levant.\nAbdulmumin al-Baghdadi said: It is devoid of vegetation: A mountain among the tribal mountains. It was said: Al-Ajrad and Al-Ashaar are two mountains of Juhaynah between Madinah and the Levant.\nAl-Samhudi said: Al-Abjar tribe, which is Khadra bin Ouf bin al-Harith bin al-Khazraj, the brothers of the Khadara tribe, went out and inhabited their house which is known as Bani Khadra. They inhabited a mountain called Al-Ajrad, where there is a well owned by Malik ibn Sinan, the grandfather of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri. Ibn Hazm mentioned that Al-Harith ibn Al-Khazraj the elder had a son named Al-Khazraj ibn Al-Harith, also said: that some of his sons traveled to the Levant with Ghassan, so they were not among the Ansar, and then he called those who remained Ansar. Al-Samhudi also said: Al-Ajrad is a mountain belonging to Khadra tribe at Busa, and a mountain belonging to Jahinah with Buwat  Al-Gelasi with also Al-Ashaar mountain and Al-Ajrad is located before Madalaja Ta'ahn.\nShurab said: \"It was mentioned on the path of Muhammad's migration: The investigators said: This is a misrepresentation, but the mountain on the way of migration is Ajaired with diminutive. As for Al-Ajrad, it is a large mountain west of the city, surrounded by Edam from the east and north and seventy-five kilometers from the city, It is far from the migration route. Al-Ajrad is the mountain whose well is called Albusa and belonged to some of the Khazraj people and also belonged to Malik bin Sinan, the father of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri.\nAl-Baladi Al-Harbi said: Ajrad is without vegetation. According to the text: Then he took them to Al-Jadjad, then on the Al-Ajrad. Today it is known by the diminutive Ajaired, a branch flows into Thaqib valley, and Thaqib is one of the tributaries of Al-Qahah, with Al-Madalaj, on the old path of migration that has been deserted. These places are located about 160 kilometers south of the city, close to Al-Far'a Valley, and the waters flow into it.\nHamad Jasser said: Al-Ajrad, is one of the villages of Shujwa in the Medina region.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountains in Saudi Arabia",

        "content": "Teloschistes velifer is a species of corticolous (bark-dwelling), fruticose lichen in the family Teloschistaceae. It occurs in Australia, New Zealand, and South America.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe lichen was first described scientifically by the Australian minister and lichenologist, Francis Wilson, in 1889. He noted the rare lichen to prefer the bark of small twigs of the plant Hymenanthera banksii, a bush upon which it would often cover an entire side.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Teloschistes velifer is characterised by its partially shrubby, upright thallus—this is the body of the lichen—which often forms dense, cushion-like patches approximately 10 mm in diameter. The upper surface of the thallus displays a radiating pattern and consists of elongated, linear lobes, each about 10 mm long and 1–2 mm wide. These lobes are slightly ridged and branch at their ends, featuring yellow, hair-like outgrowths known as fibrils that are about 0.5–1.5 mm long. The edges of the lobes often appear hooded and bear fine, greenish to greyish powdery clusters of reproductive cells known as soredia, which are exposed on the non-cortical underside of the lobes.\nThe upper side of the Teloschistes velifer is an orange-yellow colour, and when treated with potassium hydroxide (K), it turns purple. The underside is grey to whitish and mirrors the slight ridging observed on the upper side.\nThe reproductive structures, or apothecia, are about 1–3 mm in diameter and initially form broadly directly attached to the upper surface of the lobes, surrounded by conspicuous curved edges made of the same material as the thallus. Eventually, they appear to be terminal on 1–2 mm tall, ridged stalks and become convex with their margins no longer enclosed by fibrils. The disc of the apothecia is an orange-red colour with a matte texture. The asci, or spore-producing cells, are club-shaped and measure 50–60 by 12–15 µm. The ascospores themselves are two-chambered, ellipsoid, and range from 10 to 16 by 68 µm in size.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Barfußgäßchen is a 160 m (524.9 ft) long residential street in the city center of Leipzig. It connects the market with the Dittrichring and is one of the city's party miles.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the first half of the 13th century, a monastery of the Franciscans, who were also called discalced or barefooters because they wore no shoes or at most sandals, was built in the northwest part of the city. So the name Barfußgasse (barfoot alley) became common for the route from the market to the monastery. It led from the market west to Klostergasse coming from the south and then northwest to the monastery, past a small passage through the city wall, the Barfußpförtchen. As early as 1439, the rear part of Barfußgäßchen from Klostergasse to the monastery and further to the Ranstädt gate was called Fleischergasse, which was divided into Große and Kleine Fleischergasse in 1839. This ended the Barfußgäßchen at Klostergasse.\nFrom 1902 onwards, houses on Klostergasse and Kleine Fleischergasse were demolished in order to create a continuation of Barfußgäßchen westwards to Thomasring as section of the Inner City Ring Road (from 1917 Dittrichring). The new section of the street was built with residential and commercial buildings in the historicist style until 1910.\nBy the bombing of Leipzig in World War II, the numbers 11 were slightly damaged and the number 15 was badly damaged in this part. Of the latter, only the ground floor remained. The complete reconstruction did not take place until 1996. Apart from a travel agency at No. 11 and a children's goods store at No. 13, after the well-known Senf brothers' stamp shop closed in 2008, the ground floor area of Barfußgäßchen is almost exclusively used for gastronomy.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe entrance from the market is flanked on the north side by the König-Albert-Haus, built in 1913, which is opposite the former Kaufhalle trade fair building from 1848 on the south side. Between the two buildings that form part of the market, the Barfußgäßchen has its narrowest point at around 6 m (19.7 ft); the following section is about 8 m (26.2 ft) wide.\nOn the south side, there are three houses adjoining the department store, which were built together with the department store's predecessor in the 16th century and still have cross vaults on the ground floor. These so-called Zinshäuser (revenue houses) are the oldest apartment buildings in the city. As a corner house on Klostergasse, the traditional Zills Tunnel inn follows its design from 1887. To the west of Klostergasse there is a complex of three four-story buildings built between 1904 and 1906, which is called the Trifugium.\nOn the north side, the König-Albert-Haus with four house numbers (2–8) extends far into Barfußgäßchen. After another building, Kleine Fleischergasse enters at an angle, creating a small triangular square on which the Lipsia Fountain, also known as the Puttos Fountain, has stood since 1913. The Lipsia House was built on the west side of the square in 1909/1910, where the Filmeck cinema operated until 1963.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Gastronomy ==\nThere are eleven dining establishments from traditional bourgeois restaurants to hip, alternative pubs with the address Barfußgäßchen on the 160 m (524.9 ft) length of the street.

        "content": "Urfa was founded as a city under the name Edessa by the Seleucid king Seleucus I Nicator in 303 or 302 BC. There is no written evidence for earlier settlement at the site, but Urfa's favorable commercial and geographical placement suggests that there was a smaller settlement present prior to 303 BC. The indigenous Aramaic name for the site prior to the Seleucid period was Orhai or Orhay, which survives as the basis of the city's modern Turkish name. Perhaps Orhai's absence from earlier written sources is due to the settlement having been small and unfortified prior to the Seleucid period. Seleucus named the city Edessa after the ancient capital of Macedonia.\nIn the late 2nd century, as the Seleucid dynasty disintegrated, it became the capital of the Arab Nabataean Abgar dynasty, which was successively Parthian, Aramean/Syriac kingdom Osroene, Armenian, and Roman client state and eventually a Roman province. Its location on the eastern frontier of the Empire meant it was frequently conquered during periods when the Byzantine central government was weak, and for centuries, it was alternately conquered by Arab, Byzantine, Armenian, and Turkoman rulers. It fell under the rule of the Seljuks until the First Crusade. On 10 March 1098, the Crusader Baldwin of Boulogne induced the final Armenian ruler to adopt him as his successor then, after seizing power, established the first Crusader State in the East, known as the County of Edessa. Unlike other crusaders states, Christian groups such as Armenian Apostolic were allowed to keep their customs and institutions, and a level of religious tolerance was established towards Indigenous Christians, Jews and Muslims.\nUrfa was conquered by Imad al-Din Zengi in 1144 after a month-long siege, and from that point the city came under the Zengid dynasty. The last Crusader count of Edessa besieged the city again in 1146 in an attempt to retake it from the Zengids, but only held the city for six days before being defeated by Zangi's son Nur ad-Din. Urfa's population was massacred in the process, and its Christian community never recovered.\nAfter the Zengids, Urfa was ruled by the Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty from 1182 to 1260, when it was captured by the Mongols. In the early 1300s, it became part of the Mamluk Sultanate, and then the Aq Qoyunlu captured it in the early 1400s. The Ottoman Empire took Urfa from the Safavids around 1517 and ruled it until the 20th century. Under Ottoman rule, Urfa was initially was sanjak centre in Diyarbekir Eyalet, lately made capital of Raqqa Eyalet, finally made part of the Aleppo Vilayet. The area became a centre of trade in cotton, leather, and jewellery.\n\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\nUrfa shares the Balikh River Valley region with two other significant Neolithic sites at Nevalı Çori and Göbekli Tepe. Settlements in the area originated around 9000 BC as a PPNA Neolithic sites located near Abraham's Pool (Site Name: Balıklıgöl).\nIn prehistoric times, the Urfa Region was attractive for human habitation because of its dense grazing areas and the presence of wild animals on migration routes. As a result, the area became densely populated, particularly in the Neolithic period.: XXIII \nIn Urfa itself, there was a prehistoric settlement at Yeni Mahalle Höyüğü (aka Balıklıgöl Höyüğü), located immediately north of Balıklıgöl in the heart of the old town.: 15  Now buried under single-story houses, the site was accidentally discovered during road construction in the 1990s and then excavated in 1997 by the Şanlıurfa Museum Directorate. The findings included flint tools, arrowheads dated to the early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B phase, and two round buildings with terrazzo floors. Animal bones found at the site indicate hunting activity, and charred seed samples indicate that the villagers cultivated wheat and barley. The village at Yeni Mahalle is radiocarbon dated to roughly 9400–8600 BCE.: 15 \nA much later artifact is a black stone pedestal with a double bull relief, found at a hill called Külaflı Tepe in the former village of Cavşak in the 1950s when the village was being evacuated to build a base for the Urfa Brigade. The pedestal contains an inscription with an invocation to the god Tarhunza and mentions a city whose name is only partly visible, but which Bahattin Çelik restores as \"Umalia\", in the country of Bit Adini.: 16–7 \n\n\n== City of Edessa ==\n\nAncient sources describe Seleucid Edessa as following the typical plan for Hellenistic military colonies: its streets were laid out in a grid pattern, with four main streets that intersected each other. There were four city gates, and the main citadel was outside the walls. Macedonian soldiers were settled in the new city,: 89  but they never formed a majority of its population. The city's culture remained predominantly Semitic (specifically Aramaic), and any Hellenization was minimal.: 89, 91–2 \nEdessa was an important commercial center in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.: 198  Previously, the main east–west trade route across Upper Mesopotamia had gone through Harran, but the founding of Edessa caused that route to shift northwards.: 195 \nThe Seleucids declined in the 2nd century BC, and Edessa became the capital of the Abgarid kingdom of Osrhoene in about 132 BC. Originally from Nisibis, the Abgarids appear to have been an Arabized dynasty and may have ruled their kingdom \"much as Arab shaikhs, through a council of tribal elders\".: 89–90  The Abgarids were generally allied with the Parthian Empire and were under Parthian cultural influence as well.\n\nIn the early second century AD, however, the Abgarids came under Roman influence. Abgar VII supported the Roman emperor Trajan's campaign in Mesopotamia and received him \"sumptously\" at his court, but later rebelled. In retaliation, the Romans captured and destroyed Edessa, and Abgar VII was killed. The Romans installed a Parthian prince, Parthamaspates, on the Edessan throne as a puppet ruler in 117, but the Abgarids were later restored to power. Similarly, the Parthians captured Edessa in 163 and installed Wa'el bar Sharu as a puppet king. The deposed Ma'nu VIII went to the Romans, who took Edessa in 165 and restored Ma'nu to power. In 166, Osrhoene became a Roman client kingdom.: 90 \nMa'nu VIII died in 177 and was succeeded by Abgar VIII, also called Abgar the Great. Abgar sided with Pescennius Niger in his civil war against Septimius Severus. Severus ended up winning that conflict and, as punishment, stripped Abgar of most of his kingdom. Osrhoene now became a Roman province, while Abgar himself was left to rule just Edessa.: 90  Abgar mostly retired from international politics and spent the rest of his reign as \"one of the Near East's greatest patrons of the arts and learning\".: 91 \nIn 201, much of Edessa was destroyed by a major flood. According to the Chronicle of Edessa, over 2,000 people died. Abgar granted a remission of taxes for all who were affected by the flood and immediately began a large-scale reconstruction project of the city after the old Seleucid plan. Abgar repaired the old royal palace by the river, which had been damaged by the flood, but he also built a new palace on higher ground.: 91 \nIn 1979, an archaeological excavation at present-day Çamlık Parkı in central Urfa uncovered seven rock-cut tombs dating back to the first centuries AD. Mosaics on the floor appear to contain portraits of several members of the Abgarid dynasty, possibly including Abgar the Great. The tombs have since been closed back up with the mosaics still inside.: 15 \n\n\n=== Ancient Edessa's diverse religious background ===\n\nAncient Edessa was an eclectic melting pot of different religious groups.: 92  Unlike Harran, where the cult of the moon god Sin predominated, the people of Edessa worshipped a whole pantheon of gods that can generally be identified with planets.: 195  The most important were Nabu and Bel. The cult of the sun and moon that was later known in Harran as the Sabians also had followers in Edessa. The fertility goddess Atargatis, whose cult was based at Manbij, was also worshipped in Edessa.: 92  Fish were an important symbol of Atargatis, and in ancient Edessa there was a fish pond filled with sacred carp dedicated to Atargatis – today's Balıklıgöl.: 79–80  Other gods worshipped in pagan Edessa included the Nabataean deity Dushara, the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar, and also the moon god Sin. Another important cult at Edessa involved the veneration of a virgin mother and her child.: 93 \nIn addition to polytheists, Edessa also had a prominent Jewish community.: 93  Many of Edessa's Jews were merchants, involved in long-distance trade between the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean.: 94 \nBy the end of the 2nd century, a small Christian community had appeared in Edessa.: 195  The city's cosmpolitan religious background meant that its people were open and accepting towards this new religion, which just added another element into the mix. Christianity also resonated with several religious themes already present in Edessa – besides the concept of a virgin mother and child, there was also the concept of a divine trinity and a hope for life after death.: 95  The people of Edessa were also familiar with monotheism, through exposure to Judaism, and Edessa's Jewish community was probably partly responsible for the rapid spread of Christianity in the city.: 94–5  Abgar the Great reportedly converted to Christianity around the turn of the 3rd century, which if true would make Edessa the first Christian polity in the world.: 95  In 232 the relics of Thomas the Apostle were brought from Mylapore, in today's Tamil Nadu in India.\nStill more religions joined the mix during the 3rd century.: 95  One was the Bardaisanites, founded by the important philosopher Bardaisan who Abgar the Great was a patron of.: 94  Another was the Elkesaites, a syncretic religion that combined elements of Christianity, Judaism, and paganism. Its founder, Elkesai, claimed to be a reincarnation of Jesus, and the Elkesaite belief in reincarnation is possibly a sign of Buddhist influence. The prophet Mani was an Elkesaite before founding Manichaeism – another syncretic religion that \"found ready ground in Edessa\".: 96  There was already an active Manichaean community in Edessa during Mani's lifetime: there is a reference in the Cologne Mani Codex to a letter he wrote to his followers in Edessa. Manichaeism's spread to Edessa was attributed to two of Mani's disciples named Addai and Thomas. Edessa's Manichaean community remained prominent until the 5th century.: 95 \n\n\n=== Edessa under Roman rule ===\nAbgar the Great died in 212 and was succeeded by Abgar IX, also called Severus as a sign of Roman influence. Abgar IX only reigned for a year – in 213, he was summoned to Rome by the emperor Caracalla, who then had him murdered. In 214, Caracalla made Edessa a Roman colony, officially ending any autonomy the city had. A son of Abgar IX, known as Ma'nu IX, appears to have been nominally a king until 240; he received an embassy from India in 218, during the reign of Elagabalus, but he did nothing else of note. The monarchy seems to have been restored to power at some point – and Abgar IX was apparently king until 248, when the emperor Philip the Arab had him banished after Edessa rebelled.: 91 \nIn 260, the Sasanian emperor Shapur I defeated the Romans in the Battle of Edessa and captured the emperor. However, either Shapur never actually captured the city or he only held it for a very short time – it is not listed among the cities he captured in his inscription on the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, and in the aftermath of the battle he had to bribe Edessa's garrison to let his army pass unmolested.\nAs a result of Diocletian's reorganization of the empire in 293, a state-run factory was built at Edessa to make weapons and equipment for the soldiers stationed along the border. In 298, after Galerius Maximianus's victory over the Sasanians, Edessa was made capital of the new province of Osrhoene. It served as a military base in the Mesopotamian limes, although it was secondary to Nisibis in that system.\n\n\n=== Edessa during late antiquity ===\nIn the 4th through 6th centuries AD, Edessa went through arguably its period of greatest prosperity. It was again an important commercial center, and merchants grew rich on trade in luxury goods from the east, particularly silk. As with later periods, the city had a council of notable citizens who were at least partly in charge of local government and administration. In the 5th century there were three different theological schools in Edessa: the School of the Syrians (affiliated with the patriarchate of Antioch), the School of the Armenians, and the famous School of the Persians (whose teachers were not actually Persians but rather members of the Church of the East). The School of the Persians was closed down in 489 and its staff relocated to Nisibis. There were many churches in the city and monasteries in the area. Just outside the walls were several infirmaries and hospitals.: 198 \nWhen the Roman emperor Jovian surrendered Nisibis to the Sasanians in 363, an influx of refugees came to Edessa, including many Christians. One of these refugees was the writer and theologian Ephrem the Syrian, who was a co-founder of the School of the Persians in Edessa. According to T.A. Sinclair, as Christianity gained more of a presence in Edessa, the pagan planet-worshippers increasingly emigrated to Harran.: 198 \nBy the early 6th century, a small lake had formed on the west side of the city. In 525, a flood destroyed part of the western city wall and damaged some of the city. Afterwards, a deep ditch was dug on the north and east sides of the city to act as a flood channel. In normal weather, a low dam kept the Daisan river in its original course, but if the dam overflowed, then the floodwaters would flow through the artificial channel instead of into the city. At some point later on, the flood channel became the normal course of the river.: 3 \nEdessa successfully held out during a siege in 544. In 609, however, the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II captured Edessa during his campaign in Mesopotamia. Many of the city's Monophysites were deported to Iran. In 628, the Byzantine emperor Heraclius captured Edessa.\n\n\n== Age of Islam ==\nUrfa surrendered to the Rashidun general Iyad ibn Ghanm in 639 without resistance, supposedly when Iyad \"stood at its gate riding a brown horse\" according to al-Baladhuri.: 46  Several versions of the terms of surrender appear in historical sources, mentioning the citizens would be responsible for \"repairing 'bridges and roads'\".: 46  The pact also guaranteed that the city's Christians would keep ownership of the cathedral.: 244  Sometime shortly after Urfa submitted to Muslim rule, a mosque was built in the city, although its location is unknown.: 245 \nIn the early centuries of Arab rule, and particularly under the Umayyads, Urfa was still a major Christian city.: 201  It formed part of the province of Diyar Mudar.: 589  The city reportedly had 300 or 360 churches, and there were many monasteries. The population was mostly Syrian Orthodox but with significant Melkite and Jewish minorities; there were relatively few Muslims.: 201  The city was led by a group of distinguished citizens, including magnates and agricultural landowners, who \"formed a partly self-governing body\" that dealt with the caliphal government rather than the bishop.: 3, 201  Some of the leading families in this period included the Gūmāyē, the Telmaḥrāyē, and the Ruṣāfāyē.: 589 \n\nDuring the reign of the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur, the city walls were demolished after the local Muslim governor revolted.: 3  The old walls had already been damaged by floods in the 7th and 8th centuries.: 11  In 812, Urfa's citizens had to pay a large sum to the anti-Abbasid rebel Nasr ibn Shabath al-Uqayli to prevent him from attacking the unprotected city.: 589  Afterwards, the citizens had new defensive walls built around the city.: 3  According to Bar Hebraeus, the walls were commissioned by someone named Abu Shaykh and paid for by the citizens.: 589–90  The walls and towers visible today belong to this rebuilding effort, albeit with later renovations.: 3  The citadel was likely begun at the same time, probably with the addition of a moat on the south side.: 6 \nWhen the caliph al-Ma'mun came to power in 813, he dispatched his general Tahir ibn Husayn to Urfa to put down Nasr ibn Shabath's rebellion. The rebels besieged Tahir's forces in Urfa, but the local civilians (one of them was the future Syriac church leader Dionysius I Telmaharoyo) supported the soldiers and the siege was unsuccessful. Tahir's troops later mutinied, however, and he was forced to flee to Raqqa; he later appointed someone named 'Abd al-A'la as governor of Urfa.: 590  In 825, while Tahir's son Abdallah was governor of al-Jazira, his brother Muhammad enacted a series of anti-Christian policies in Urfa. He ordered the destruction of several churches, claiming that they had illegally been built after the Muslim conquest. That same year, he also had a new mosque built in the tetrapylon in front of the city's Melkite cathedral. Before its conversion into a mosque, the tetrapylon had been a meeting place for church leaders. The locations of the mosque and cathedral are unknown.: 245 \nIn the spring of 943, the Byzantine army campaigned in upper Mesopotamia, capturing several cities and either threatening Urfa or, according to Symeon Magister, besieging it outright.: 19  The Byzantines demanded that the mandylion (called al-mandīl in Arabic), by now a famous Christian relic, be handed over to the emperor. In return, the city would be spared and 200 Muslim prisoners would be released. With permission from the caliph al-Muttaqi, the people of Edessa handed over the mandylion and signed a truce with the Byzantines.: 46 : 589  The mandylion was translated to Constantinople; it arrived \"triumphantly\" on 15 August 944.: 19 \n\n\n== 11th century ==\nThe Numayrid emir Waththab ibn Sabiq declared independence in 990 and annexed Edessa early in his reign. Waththab appointed his cousin 'Utayr as governor of the city.: 204  'Utayr installed someone named Ahmad ibn Muhammad as his na'ib (deputy) here, but then later had him assassinated.: 590  This evidently made 'Utayr unpopular with the locals, since Ahmad had treated them well.: 204  In 1025/6 (416 AH), the city's inhabitants rebelled and appealed to Nasr ad-Dawla, the Marwanid emir of Diyar Bakr.: 590 : 204  At first, Nasr ad-Dawla appointed someone named Zangi to be his deputy in Edessa, but Zangi died in 1027. Meanwhile, 'Utayr had been assassinated.: 590  This time, Nasr ad-Dawla ended up appointing two deputies to jointly control Edessa: he chose 'Utayr's son, known only by the nasab \"Ibn 'Utayr\", to be in charge of the main citadel, while he appointed a different Numayrid named Shibl ad-Dawla to be in charge of the smaller citadel – i.e. the converted east gate, now the Bey Kapısı.: 204 \n\nIn October 1031, the Byzantine general George Maniakes conquered Edessa. This would ultimately be the last significant territorial acquisition by the Byzantine Empire in Mesopotamia.: 20  The accounts of this event differ heavily.: 590  According to one version, Ibn 'Utayr had entered into negotiations with Maniakes, intending to sell him the citadel. His desire to sell was apparently motivated by a threat from Shibl ad-Dawla.: 204  In John Skylitzes's version, however, Maniakes had bribed Salman, a deputy of Nasr ad-Dawla's, into surrendering the city to him in the middle of the night.: 20  If this was the case, then Salman either had some authority over Ibn 'Utayr or had otherwise deposed him.: 204 \nWhoever Maniakes had been negotiating with, Byzantine forces gained control of some of the fortifications but not the rest of the city.: 204  Exactly which parts Maniakes had taken control of are unclear – Skylitzes described Maniakes had taken possession of \"three heavily fortified towers\", but his description of Edessa's geography is completely inaccurate and he clearly had never been to the city himself. Matthew of Edessa's account, which is more reliable, mentions \"three citadels\"; according to Tara Andrews, the upper citadel must have been one of them.: 20  According to T.A. Sinclair, Maniakes had already gained control of the upper citadel.: 204  That winter, Nasr ad-Dawla came with an army in an attempt to drive out the Byzantines.: 590  Nasr ad-Dawla tried to besiege the Byzantine positions but was unsuccessful and decided to loot the city and tear down buildings, then burn the city to the ground while retreating with camels carrying off precious objects. According to Skylitzes, Maniakes was able to then capture the citadel and, summoning external reinforcements, secure the whole city.: 20 \nManiakes remained in charge of Edessa for several years and, according to Honigmann and Bosworth, appears to have been relatively autonomous from the Byzantines, merely sending an annual tribute to Constantinople.: 590  On the other hand, while Skylitzes does mention that \"Maniakes sent an annual tribute of 50 pounds [of gold] to the emperor\", Niccolò Zorzi remarks that this \"does not necessarily imply that Edessa 'enjoyed a certain amount of independence from Byzantium'\".: 21  The citadel became known as \"Maniakes's citadel\" at some point.: 21 \nIn May 1036, the Numayri prince Ibn Waththab plundered the city and took the patricius of Edessa as prisoner, but the fortress remained in the hands of the Byzantine garrison.: 590  A peace treaty was reached in 1037; under its terms, Edessa came directly under Byzantine control and it was refortified.: 590  Edessa now became an important Byzantine command placed under a series of katepanos and dukes.: 204  The \"duchy\" of Edessa probably comprised the whole area beyond the Euphrates under their control with several fortresses north of the river.: 20  The city \"was still inhabited by many Christians\" at this point.: 590 \nIn 1065-6 and 1066–7, the city was attacked by the Turkish leader Khurasan-Salar.: 590  For 50 days beginning on 10 March 1071, Urfa was besieged by the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan.: 23  Alp Arslan eventually lifted the siege in return for a large payment and possibly also the submission of its ruler, the doux Basilios Alousianos (son of Alusian of Bulgaria).: 23  After the Battle of Manzikert, Edessa was intended to be handed over to the Seljuks, but the Byzantine emperor Romanos Diogenes was deposed and in the political chaos its katepano Paulus ended up siding with the new emperor.: 590 \nIn 1077 or 1078, Basil Apokapes besieged and captured Edessa, displacing the Byzantine governor Leo Diabatenos.: 23  He was an agent of Philaretos Brachamios, the main Byzantine agent in the region who governed from Marash; however, Basil ruled Edessa independently.: 205  In 1081–2, an amir named Khusraw unsuccessfully besieged the city.: 590  After Basil's death in 1083, the citizens of Edessa elected an Armenian named Smbat to succeed him.: 23  Smbat was in charge for six months before Philaretos came in person on 23 September 1083.: 590  He appointed a Greek eunuch as governor and gave him the title parakoimomenos; this eunuch was later assassinated by an official named Barsauma.: 23 \nHowever, Edessa was in a particularly vulnerable position \"caught between two blocks of Uqaylid territory\", and it was particularly vulnerable to the Seljuks.: 205  In 1086–7, the Seljuk sultan Malik Shah I sent his general Buzan to take the city: 205  while he himself campaigned in Syria.: 23  A three-month siege followed, with Barsauma defending the city.: 23  The city surrendered in March 1087 and Buzan appointed a Seljuk commander to head the citadel.: 23  At some point, an Armenian named Toros in charge of the city administration – according to the Syriac Chronicle of 1234, this happened in 1087, while Matthew of Edessa wrote that it happened after Buzan's death in 1094.: 23  Toros appears to have begun a rebuilding project on the Bey Kapısı fortress, but it wasn't finished until after his rule.: 13  Meanwhile, Malik Shah had died in 1092 and a Seljuk dynastic crisis had broken out.: 23  In 1094, Malik Shah's brother Tutush demanded the city's surrender, but both Toros and the Seljuk citadel commander refused.: 23  Tutush's forces seized the citadel and made their encampment on the west side of the city.: 23  Fearing an attack from them, Toros apparently tried to cut the citadel off by building a wall between it and the city.: 23  After Tutush died in 1095, however, his forces abandoned the citadel and Toros now took control of the whole city as a de facto independent ruler.: 23 \nDuring the 11th century, there was a large influx of Armenian immigrants into the region, especially the towns.: 6  In Urfa, they supplanted Syrians as the leading citizens and wealthiest landowners.: 6 \n\n\n== County of Edessa ==\n\nUrfa was capital of the crusader County of Edessa for about half a century beginning in 1098.: 590  The crusaders' subjects were a mix of Armenians and Syrians.: 6  In Urfa itself, Armenians were the dominant group.: 6  The crusaders themselves don't seem to have undertaken much construction in Urfa.: 6  The only extant structure that can be attributed to them is the southernmost tower of the Bey Kapısı, on the east side of the city walls.: 6  This was completing the rebuilding that Toros had begun before the crusaders seized Edessa and was finished in 1122–3, while the count Joscelin I was in captivity at Harput.: 13 \n\n\n=== Sieges of 1144 and 1146 ===\n\nThe County of Edessa had survived largely because their Muslim rivals were disunited.: 590  The rise of a single powerful Muslim rival – namely Imad ad-Din Zangi, the crafty atabeg of Mosul – spelled disaster for the county.: 590–1  The tipping point came in late 1144, when Joscelin II left Edessa with a big chunk of his soldiers to assist Zengi's rival Kara Arslan.: 461 \nUpon becoming aware of the city's weakness, Zengi led a series of forced marches and laid siege to the city on 24 November.: 461  By 24 December, he had successfully gained entry to the city; the citadel fell two days later on the 26th.: 461  Zengi's forces spared the native Christian population and their churches, but the Franks were killed and their churches destroyed.: 461  Zengi then appointed Zayn ad-Din Ali Küçük, the commander of his guard, as governor of the city.: 461 \nThe fall of Edessa was a direct motivator for the Second Crusade.: 466–8  Christian pilgrims returning to Europe brought news of the city's conquest, and emissaries from the crusader states also came to appeal for help.: 466  The pope responded by issuing the papal bull Quantum praedecessores on 1 December 1145, which directly called for another crusade.: 466–7  Meanwhile, in the Muslim world, news of this victory made Zengi a hero.: 461  The caliph gave him many gifts and titles, including al-malik al-mansūr – \"the victorious king\".: 461 \nIn May 1146, there was a plot by Urfa's Armenian community to overthrow the Turks and restore the city to Joscelin II.: 86–7  The Turks suppressed this plot and settled 300 Jewish families in the city.: 86–7  However, after Zengi was assassinated on 14 September 1146,: 461  the Armenians again conspired with Joscelin II to take the city.: 531  Sometime in October, Joscelin II and Baldwin of Marash came and laid siege to the city.: 531  This second siege proved far more destructive than the first.: 531  The Franks succeeded in entering the city, but they were not properly equipped for a siege of the main citadel.: 531  During their six-day-long reoccupation of Urfa, the Franks indiscriminately looted shops belonging to Christians and Muslims alike.: 86–7  The city's Muslims either fled to Harran or took shelter in the citadel with the Turkish garrison.: 86–7 \nMeanwhile, Imad ad-Din's successor Nur ad-Din Zengi had arrived with an army of 10,000 soldiers and surrounded the city.: 531  When the Franks realized they were trapped, they attempted to retreat, but it ended in disaster and they were slaughtered as they tried to escape.: 10–12  Moreover, the city's population was massacred – the men were put to death, while the women and children were sold into slavery.: 86–7  The city's Christian community, one of the oldest in the world, had been destroyed and never recovered.: 240 \n\n\n== Zengid rule ==\nAlthough Nur ad-Din was an active builder elsewhere, only one building at Urfa can be attributed to him: the \"rather plain\" Great Mosque, which was probably on the site of an earlier church.: 6 \nAfter Nur ad-Din's death in 1174, Urfa was captured by his nephew Sayf al-Din Ghazi II.: 591 \n\n\n== Ayyubid dynasty ==\n\nSaladin captured Urfa in 1182 after a siege; he then separately besieged the citadel.: 48  He ended up paying the defenders off to let him take control of the citadel.: 48  He then appointed Muzaffar al-Din Gökböri as governor of Urfa along with Harran.: 48  During Saladin's reign, the cathedral of the Melkites was demolished.: 6  Part was used as building material for Urfa's citadel, and part was taken to Harran.: 6 \nThe Ayyubid empire essentially functioned as a dynastic \"confederation of principalities united under one leading prince\".: 212  During Saladin's reign, he established a principality based at Harran; Urfa was part of this principality.: 213  After Gökböri, the Harran-Urfa principality was also held by Saladin's brother al-Adil, who later ruled as the Ayyubid sultan himself.: 213 \nDuring Ayyubid rule, Edessa had a population of approximately 24,000, according to J.C. Russell's estimate (Russell generally favored smaller, more conservative estimates).: 59 \nIn June 1234, the city was taken by the Seljuk sultan Kayqubad I's army, and its inhabitants were deported to Anatolia.: 591  However, it was recaptured within four months by the Ayyubid ruler al-Kamil.: 591  Sometime shortly thereafter, the citadel was slighted on al-Kamil's orders.: 9–10 \n\n\n== Mongol rule ==\nIn 1260, Urfa voluntarily submitted to the troops of Hulagu and thus came under Mongol rule.: 591  Because the city had surrendered peacefully, its inhabitants were spared.: 591 \nThe Mongols never garrisoned Urfa; it was near their western border with the Mamluk Sultanate and was probably seen as \"too difficult to defend\".: 7  Its ruined fortress was \"probably not thought worth repairing\".: 7  The city was desolate at this point; its inhabitants had evacuated or abandoned it and \"only Turcoman nomads lived in the otherwise empty city\".: 7 \n\n\n== Mamluk rule ==\nThe Mamluks gained control of Urfa sometime in the early 14th century.: 7  They renovated the ruined citadel probably during the third reign of an-Nasir Muhammad (1309–40), but the city \"attracted few inhabitants\".: 7, 216  The Mamluk garrison only occupied the citadel itself; the surrounding city was still practically deserted and not worth committing any soldiers to defend.: 218  Located close to the Mamluks' eastern frontier, Urfa had \"no commercial importance\" because merchant traffic in Upper Mesopotamia was taking a route through Mardin and Ra's al-'Ayn rather than through Amid and Urfa.: 7, 218–9 \nThat changed in the late 14th century, toward the end of the Mamluk period.: 7, 218  Some commercial traffic had begun passing through Urfa en route to Aleppo, and the city became at least partly repopulated.: 218  By around 1400, al-Qalqashandi wrote that Urfa had been rebuilt and was prosperous again.: 591  Meanwhile, in 1394, Timur occupied Urfa without much resistance; he \"admired the buildings and took away some of the portable wealth\".: 219 \n\n\n== Aq Qoyunlu ==\nThe Aq Qoyunlu took over Urfa in the early 15th century.: 7  They apparently regarded it as a strategic military outpost on their western frontier.: 7  The citadel was again repaired, and the Hasan Paşa Camii may date to this period as well.: 7  The Aq Qoyunlu took it in perhaps the late 1410s or early 1420s.: 219  At some point, the Aq Qoyunlu ruler Kara Osman granted Urfa to his son Ali.: 59  But due to Ali's quarrels with his brothers beginning in autumn 1428, and the brothers wrote Kara Osman, Kara Osman got upset with Ali and relieved him of his post.: 59  Instead, he appointed one of the brothers, Habil, as governor of Urfa.: 59 \nAli left Urfa in 1429 and headed north, where he ended up besieging Harput.: 59  The governor of Harput wrote to the Mamluk sultan, al-Ashraf Barsbay, for assistance, offering to give him control of Harput in return.: 59  Barsbay agreed and began mustering an army in Damascus, but while his forces were still gathering Harput surrendered to Ali.: 59  With their primary objective undermined, the Mamluks decided to attack Urfa instead.: 59  This way, they could eliminate an Aq Qoyunlu base that could be used to attack Mamluk-held Aleppo.: 59 \nOne day before the main Mamluk army arrived, a \"local Arab contingent\" reached Urfa and fought a battle against Habil's Turkic forces.: 59  They were defeated.: 59  The Mamluk army arrived the next day and began a siege of the city.: 59  On 24 July, the citadel surrendered, and the Mamluks sacked the city.: 59  They demolished the fortress, enslaved the women and children who lived in the city, and killed many others.: 59  Habil himself was captured and taken to Egypt in chains.: 59  Contemporary historians compared the violent event to Timur's sack of Damascus in 1400.: 59 \nAbout a decade later, Urfa was involved in the civil war between Ali Beg's son Jahangir and Jahangir's uncle Hamza for control of the Aq Qoyunlu.: 59  The contemporary historian Tihrani Isfahani wrote that Hamza's troops besieged Urfa but did not elaborate.: 60  Jahangir ended up making Urfa his main base at some point, from which he attacked Hamza in Erzincan and then later sent a raid against Ergani.: 60  Urfa was then the site of a battle in 1451, where Uzun Hasan successfully defeated other Aq Qoyunlu leaders shortly before gaining control of the tribal confederation as a whole.: 219  In 1462–3, under Uzun Hasan's reign, Urfa's citadel was renovated.: 10 \nIn early November 1480, a large Mamluk army under Yashbak min Mahdi, who was dawātdār-i kabīr or executive secretary to the Mamluk sultan Qaitbay, laid siege to Urfa.: 60  Yashbak bombarded the city walls with heavy cannon fire and used catapults to hurl fireballs into the city.: 60  This happened during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, prompting Fazlallah Khunji Isfahani to liken Yashbak's actions to the tyrant Nimrod torturing the prophet Abraham with fire – also in Urfa, according to tradition.: 60  Aq Qoyunlu forces quickly arrived at Urfa from Diyar Bakr and, after a failed attempt at negotiations, a pitched battle took place.: 60  The Aq Qoyunlu army's right wing was commanded by Sulayman Beg Bijan and the left wing was commanded by Khalil Beg Mawsillu.: 60  The Mamluk forces were utterly defeated, and Yashbak was later executed.: 60 \n\n\n== Ottoman period ==\n\nUrfa was likely initially incorporated into the Ottoman Empire during the rule of Selim I around 1517.: 591  The earliest surviving Ottoman tax register for Urfa, compiled in 1518, documented 1,082 families (700 Muslim and 382 Christian), suggesting a total population slightly exceeding 5,500 people.: 591  The relatively low population figure can be attributed to political turmoil in the region, particularly the ongoing conflict with Safavid Iran.: 591  By 1526, the city's population had increased to 1,322 families (988 Muslim and 334 Christian), indicating an estimated population of approximately 8,000.: 591 \nUrfa experienced a renaissance under Ottoman rule.: 7  Industry and commerce picked back up, and its population rebounded, although it never reached the same population heights it had once held in the classical and early medieval periods.: 7  The high point lasted for about a century and a half, beginning with its conquest by the Ottomans.: 7  According to Mehmet Adil Saraç, Urfa's population first became majority Turkish sometime during this period, sometime between 1520 and 1570.: 22 \nOne important event that contributed to the upswing in commerce was Süleyman the Magnificent's successful Mesopotamian campaign against Safavid Iran in 1534–36, which took Baghdad and increased the security of trade routes in Urfa's region.: 31  By 1566, a tax register shows the city with an estimated 13,000 to 14,000 people (1,704 Muslim families and 866 Christian families).: 591  At this point, the city was described as having five large mahalles, each named after one of the five city gates, and it \"must have had an active textile industry\".: 591  A bedestan is also recorded.: 591 \nUrfa's prosperity in the 1500s was based on both trade and agricultural production.: 66  In the countryside, there was a major \"expansion of cultivated and inhabited land\", resulting in abundant harvests reaching the city's markets.: 66  Meanwhile, the caravan trade continued to stimulate commercial activity: 66  – Urfa was an important entrepot on trade routes between Iran and Aleppo.: 7 \nBecause of its prosperity, Urfa's population grew as it attracted residents from nearby cities.: 66  In 1571, a government report indicated that most of the government employees under the governor of Diyarbakır were actually living in Urfa instead.: 66  In 1586, Ottoman authorities created the Eyalet of Raqqa out of territories that had previously belonged to the Eyalet of Diyarbekir, and Urfa became \"the center of economic and political power\" in this new province.: 258 \nAt the same time, the city's prosperity attracted bandits and nomadic tribes.: 66–7  A report from October 1565 indicates that the wealthy, populous villages around Urfa were suffering from banditry, and another report from November 1588 indicates that there was a large-scale uprising of Bedouin tribes in the region.: 67  For most of the 1500s, this was mostly a rural problem; Urfa itself was mostly unaffected.: 67  That changed at the end of the century, when the revolt of Karayazıcı Abdulhalim turned Urfa into a battlefield.: 67 \nRelatively little is known about Karayazıcı, but he was presumably a tribesman who worked as a bureaucrat in the local administration (Yazıcı means \"scribe\").: 67  His army was recruited from other local tribal members.: 67  In 1599–1600 (1008 AH), Karayazıcı's army laid siege to the outer and then inner citadel and thus gained control of Urfa.: 67  The contemporary historian Mustafa Selaniki blamed Urfa's fall on the governors of Aleppo and Damascus failing to send reinforcements in time.: 67 \nKarayazıcı's plan seems to have been to capture the citadel quickly in order to gain access to guns and ammunition that would enable his forces to resist Ottoman reinforcements.: 67  He set up a \"quasi-state\" based at Urfa's inner citadel, declaring himself sultan and Hüseyin Pasha (who had worked with him to capture the citadel) as grand vizier.: 67  Eventually, though, Ottoman troops (backed by reinforcements from Damascus and Aleppo) surrounded the inner citadel, dug trenches, and engaged the rebels in a bloody battle in the middle of the city.: 68  The rebels ran into ammunition shortages during the battle and had to melt down coins to use as bullets.: 68  Hüseyin Pasha was killed in the battle, but Karayazıcı himself managed to escape.: 68 \nThe instability accompanying the Celali revolts, and especially Karayazıcı's occupation of the city, must have sapped Urfa's prosperity.: 591  Several 17th-century accounts refer to parts of the town as being in disrepair.: 592  For example, when Jean-Baptiste Tavernier visited Urfa in 1644, \"there were so many empty lots that [he] compared the town to a desert\".: 592  The central Ottoman state's control of the surrounding Raqqa Eyalet weakened significantly in the early 1600s.: 259  Powerful ümera families from Urfa assumed responsibility for governance of the eyalet, while the actual office of governor was a sinecure for prominent Ottoman generals or their sons.: 259–60 \nUrfa court records from about 1629 to 1631 (1039–40 AH) provide insight into local government during the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1623–1629.: 259  The Ottomans were in the process of mobilizing troops and resources in the area for the war effort, and the qadi of Urfa was responsible for billeting troops and gathering provisions.: 259  In August 1638, Sultan Murad IV stayed at Urfa along with his army while en route to Baghdad in the final campaign of the war.: 12  He ordered restoration work on the citadel, which is mentioned in written sources and confirmed by an inscription on the walls that still exists.: 12 \nThe most detailed account of early Ottoman Urfa was written by Evliya Çelebi, who visited the city in 1646.: 591  Part of his interest may have been because one of his relatives was a qadi here.: 591  His account mentions only three gates, with different names than those of the 1566 tax register.: 591  Evliya wrote that he counted 2,600 houses in the fortified part of the city, which probably indicates a population total similar to 1566.: 591  At this point, Urfa had houses generally made of mud brick; more opulent houses, belonging to paşas and qadis, had their own gardens and baths.: 591  Evliya also recorded 22 mosques, 3 medreses, and 3 zaviyes.: 591–2  He listed several hans, including the Yemiş Hânı, the Samsatkapısı, the Hacı İbrâhim Hânı, the Beykapısı Hânı, and the Sebîl Hânı.: 306  He also wrote that the city had 400 shops and several mills, including one named after one Tayyaroğlu Ahmed Paşa.: 592  However, he was apparently unimpressed by the city's shops and markets.: 592 \nEvliya also wrote that Urfa had a tannery that produced high-quality yellow maroquin leather.: 592  Tavernier also noted the city's leather, saying that along with Tokat and Diyarbakır it produced some of the best maroquin leathers.: 592  Besides leather, Urfa was also renowned for its cotton fabrics during this period.: 592 \nAccording to Onur Usta, part of why Urfa appeared to European visitors as \"a derelict city with houses reduced to rubble\" during this period was because it had a lot of residents from nomadic and tribal backgrounds.: 68  These people would have still engaged in nomadic transhumance activities during most parts of the year and \"only needed a roof over their heads during the winter\".: 69  The abandoned-looking houses would have belonged to them.: 69 \n\nInformation about Urfa during the 1700s is relatively scarce, but one source is the fiscal records of the new Rızvaniye Mosque.: 592  These document the waqf properties assigned to the mosque, including shops, gardens, mills, and public baths, as well as information about tenants and rents.: 592  There was a mulberry orchard in front of the medrese at this point, as well as a prosperous marketplace with little empty space available for rent.: 592 \nBased on various fiscal and tax documents, it seems that Urfa suffered a series of troubles in the 1750s and began to sink into poverty.: 70  One of the most serious problems was rampant banditry, which both impeded agricultural production in surrounding rural areas and hindered economic recovery.: 70–1 \nA serious outbreak of plague hit Urfa in the 1780s, and many people died.: 22  Iraqi Turkmen, particularly from the regions around Mosul and Kirkuk, were deported and resettled in Urfa to help repopulate the city.: 22  The connection with Kirkuk in particular left cultural and linguistic traces in Urfa, and some present-day Urfalis have described the two cities as having an \"uncle-nephew relationship\".: 19, 22 \n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nIn the Ottoman period, Urfa was a center of commerce because of its location at a crossroads with Diyarbakır, Antep, Mardin, and Raqqa.: 292  Many Jewish, Armenian, and Greek merchants were present in Urfa, especially from Aleppo.: 292 \nJames Silk Buckingham visited Urfa in 1816 and ended up stuck there for a while because the roads were closed due to the ongoing Ottoman-Wahhabi War.: 592  Buckingham's account of early-1800s Urfa is one of the most informative of the late Ottoman period.: 592  By this time, the name \"Urfa\" had come to predominate, with only the city's Arab Christians still calling it \"al-Ruha\".: 592  The standard of living in Urfa had evidently increased since the 1600s – the mud brick houses recorded by Evliya Çelebi had given way to finer masonry structures that Buckingham compared to the houses of Aleppo.: 592  The houses described by Buckingham had harem and selamlik quarters separated by a courtyard, with the selamliks boasting \"opulently furnished reception rooms\" on their upper floors.: 592  Buckingham described the city as being divided into janissary and sharif factions, also like Aleppo.: 592  Many of the city's bazaars were closed due to the war, but Buckingham noted that Urfa had a thriving cotton trade during peacetime and observed some of the city's cotton printers at work.: 592  Coarser wool cloth and rugs were also manufactured in Urfa.: 592 \nIn the mid-1800s, Urfa benefitted from a general increase in commercial activity in the region.: 8  Most of the larger courtyard houses in the present-day old town probably date from this period.: 8  The large Armenian church on the western main street was built in 1842 and many mosques were probably also built around this time.: 8  According to Suraiya Faroqhi, though, the city's population \"must have been at a low ebb for several decades in the mid-century\".: 593 \n\nHowever, in the late 1800s, Urfa declined in importance as a commercial center.: 292  In particular, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 caused a major realignment of trade routes, shifting away from overland caravans and towards maritime commerce.: 292  As a result, the volume of commercial traffic coming through Urfa decreased markedly compared to previous periods and became increasingly local/regional in nature.: 292  The local economy shifted away from producing goods for export and toward meeting the basic needs of the local population.: 292  Workshops produced less in general during this period and their focus was more on cheap basic goods like local fabrics and household goods.: 292  Imports also declined because the locals were focusing more on consuming cheap basic goods rather than luxuries; they were living simpler, more frugal lives.: 292  Because people were using more local products, the cost of living also decreased and people had to work less to meet their expenses.: 292–3  Contemporary court records document that there was extensive commercial contact between Muslims and non-Muslims; they bought and sold goods freely between each other and entered into commercial partnerships together, indicating that there was relatively high trust between both groups.: 293–4 \nThe main centers of commercial activity in the Ottoman period were the bazaars, where both local and imported goods were bought and sold.: 309  Generally, a bazaar would be named after its primary function and main goods sold there.: 309  For example, the İsotçular Çarşısı was named because of the homemade chili peppers sold in this street.: 309  Among the bazaars mentioned in late 19th-century records: Kadıoğlu, Köroğlu, Eski Arasa, Teymurcu, Sarayönü, Belediye, Beykapı, Akar, Sipâhî, Bedestan, Hânönü, Kafavhâne, and Hüseyniye.: 309 \nThere was a huge increase in the number of hans recorded in the Aleppo Salnames in the late 1800s: from just 7 in 1867 to 11 in 1888, 18 in 1889, and 32 in 1898.: 306  According to Yasin Taş, this is because not only were new hans being built, but records were simply counting more types of commercial buildings as hans.: 306  Muslim and non-Muslim travelers would both use the same hans regardless of religion.: 309 \nIn the countryside surrounding Urfa, life went on largely unchanged.: 314  Most rural villagers were involved in agriculture, and farmlands were typically plowed using the same low-tech methods that had been used for thousands of years.: 314  Cows and oxen were kept as draft animals.: 314  Irrigated farmland around the Euphrates and some streams was more expensive than the waterless fields called \"deştî land\" which was not able to be irrigated.: 314  Irrigation channels were repaired jointly among the people who used the water.: 314  Sometimes there would be people living in the city (often non-Muslim) who would own farmland outside the city and deputize local villagers (often Muslim) to run the farm under the muzâraa contract.: 314–5  In 1846, taxes could not be collected because of drought and locusts.: 315  In 1861, 1863, and 1886, there were locusts; in 1870 there was a drought due to lack of rain.: 315 \nUp until the mid-1890s, about 20,000 of the city's 60,000 residents were Armenians.: 620  In 1895, however, thousands of Armenians were killed in a series of massacres by both civilians and soldiers.: 620  First, in October, Turkish and Kurdish locals killed hundreds of Armenians over a two-day period.: 620  Then for two months the Armenian quarter was effectively subjected to a siege, with no food or water allowed in.: 620  The Turks claimed that the Armenians had a weapon cache, which they demanded in return for lifting the siege.: 620  In December, the siege ended when \"a crowd of Turkish soldiers and civilians\" entered the Armenian quarter and killed thousands of its inhabitants.: 620  About 3,000 survivors sought shelter in a nearby church – which is normally recognized as a place of refuge under Islamic law.: 620  However, soldiers burned the church to the ground, killing everyone inside.: 620  The troops went on to loot and burn the rest of the Armenian quarter.: 620  According to Lord Kinross, some 8,000 Armenians were killed in total.\nThere was a small but ancient Jewish community in Urfa, with a population of about 1,000 by the 19th century. Most of the Jews emigrated in 1896, fleeing the Hamidian massacres, and settling mainly in Aleppo, Tiberias and Jerusalem. There were three Christian communities: Syriac, Armenian, and Latin. The last Neo-Aramaic Christians left in 1924 and went to Aleppo (where they settled in a place that was later called Hay al-Suryan \"The Syriac Quarter\").\n\n\n== First World War and aftermath ==\n\nDuring the First World War, Urfa was a site of the Armenian and Assyrian genocides, beginning in 1915. Members of Urfa's Armenian community were deported and killed. In May, 18 families were deported from Urfa, and in June, 50 people were arrested, tortured, and then deported to Diyarbakır, where they were killed on the road. Urfa was also a stop on the deportation route, and the Urfa resistance in October was composed of Armenians deported from Van and Diyarbakır. Survivors from killings elsewhere had begun to arrive in Urfa, and by mid-August, massacres had begun in Urfa itself. Some 400 Armenians were taken to the edge of town and killed during a four-day period from 15 to 19 August. Another massacre took place on 23 September, when 300 Armenians were killed.\nIn response to the Urfa resistance in October, Mehmet Celal Bey, who had served as governor of Aleppo before being sacked for refusing to comply with the order to deport the local Armenians, commented: \"Each human has the right to live. A trampled worm will squirm and wriggle. The Armenians will defend themselves.\" The final event of the resistance was on 15 October, when several thousand Turkish troops attacked their position. The next day, some 20,000 Armenian deportees in transit were killed in and around Urfa.\nMeanwhile, during the Russian occupation of Western Armenia, many Turks fleeing those regions came and settled in Urfa.: 22  Mehmet Adil Saraç estimates that around 8 to 10 thousand Turks migrated to the Urfa region this way.: 22 \nAt the end of the First World War, the Treaty of Sèvres assigned Urfa to the French-controlled Mandate of Syria, 5 km south of the border with Turkey.: 15  As a result, Urfa was occupied by British and then French troops.: 17  Locals from Urfa formed a militia and successfully drove out the occupying troops on 11 April 1920.: 17  The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne officially settled the matter by including Urfa as part of the new Republic of Turkey.: 593 \nUnder the new republic, Urfa was made capital of the new Urfa Province on 20 April 1924.: 17 \nUrfa Halkevi was established on 23 February 1934,: 2  on a site that had earlier been occupied by a vocational school called the Mekteb-i Sanayi.: 190  The halkevi opened with only 7 branches: Language and Literature, Fine Arts, Representation, Sport, Social Assistance, Library and Publication, and Villagers.: 1–2, 99  An eighth branch, People's Classrooms and Courses, was added in 1935.: 99  Throughout its existence, the Urfa Halkevi faced financial difficulties.: 878  It was eventually closed down when the halkevi program was abolished in 1951.: 877 \nDuring this period, there were 7 newspapers in Urfa: the Urfa'da Milli Gazete (\"National Gazette in Urfa\"), Yeni Işık (\"New Light\"), Yenilik (\"Newness\"), Işık (\"Light\"), Urfa, Akgün (\"White Day\"), and İrfan (\"Knowledge\").: 102 \n\n\n== 21st century ==\nDuring the Syrian Civil War, thousands of Syrian refugees fled to Turkey, and many of them settled in Urfa.: 111–2  When Raqqa became the capital of the Islamic State, Urfa became a gateway for jihadists entering Syria because of its closeness to the Akçakale-Tall Abyad border crossing and to Raqqa itself. The city's general religious-conservative climate meant that many locals who adhere to Salafi thought sympathized with the Islamic State, and many of its members lived in the city as well.\nOn 6 February 2023, Urfa suffered some damage from the twin Turkey-Syria earthquakes.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The competition begins with a group stage featuring sixteen teams divided into two groups. Matches are played in a double round-robin system with home-and-away fixtures, fourteen in total for each team. In Groups A and B, the top two teams automatically qualify for the quarter-finals, with teams ranked 3rd to 6th entering the playoff round.\nThe knockout stage includes four rounds: the playoffs, quarter-finals, and a final-four tournament comprising two semifinals and the final. In the playoffs, eight teams are paired against each other in two-legged home-and-away matches (third-placed in group A plays sixth-placed group B; fourth-placed group A plays fifth-placed group B, etc.). The four aggregate winners of the playoffs advance to the quarterfinals, joining the top-two teams of Groups A and B. The eight quarterfinalist teams are paired against each other in two-legged home-and-away matches, with the four aggregate winners qualifying to the final-four tournament.\nIn the final four tournament, the semifinals and the final are played as single matches at a pre-selected host venue.\n\n\n== Rankings ==\nThis season, the EHF decided to make separate rankings for each club competition.\n\nAssociations 1–9 can have their league champion qualify for the Group Stage and apply for a wildcards.\nThe Association that won the past season's EHF European League can have their league champion and runner up qualify for the Group Stage but cannot apply for a wildcard.\nAssociations below the top 9 can only have their league champion apply for a Wildcard.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024–25 EHF European League\n2024–25 EHF European Cup\n2024–25 Women's EHF Champions League\n2024–25 Women's EHF European League\n2024–25 Women's EHF European Cup\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

He is the grandson of longtime ARCA driver and team owner Wayne Peterson.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nIn 2019, Peterson made his debut in the ARCA Menards Series at Salem Speedway, driving the No. 0 Ford for Wayne Peterson Racing. After setting the slowest time in both practice and qualifying, he went on to finish 21st after running only three laps due to brake issues. He then entered in the next event at Lucas Oil Raceway, where after once again setting the slowest time in practice, he did not set a time in qualifying and did not start the race; he would officially be classified in 22nd position.\nIn 2024, Peterson participated in the pre-season test for the ARCA Menards Series at Daytona International Speedway, driving the No. 06 Toyota for Wayne Peterson Racing, and placed 70th in the overall results between the two testing days. In April of that year, it was revealed that Peterson will drive the No. 0 Toyota at Talladega Superspeedway.\n\n\n== Motorsports career results ==\n\n\n=== ARCA Menards Series ===\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

        "content": "NGC 747 is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation Cetus. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 5,100 ± 19 km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 75.2 ± 5.3 Mpc (∼245 million ly). NGC 747 was discovered by American astronomer Francis Leavenworth in 1886. The luminosity class of NGC 747 is II and it has a broad HI line. To date, four non-redshift measurements yield a distance of 83.900 ± 4.166 Mpc (∼274 million ly), which is within the Hubble distance range. Note, however, that it is with the average value of independent measurements, when they exist, that the NASA/IPAC database calculates the diameter of a galaxy and that consequently the diameter of NGC 747 could be approximately 23 .9 kpc (∼78,000 ly). In the same area of the sky there are, among other things: the galaxies NGC 713, NGC 731, NGC 755 and NGC 767. The object was discovered in 1886 by the American astronomer Francis Preserved Leavenworth.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of NGC objects (1–1000)\nLists of galaxies\nGalaxy cluster\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 747 at SEDS USA\nNGC 747 at SIMBAD",

        "content": "Memories of You: Remembering Joe Williams is a 2003 studio album by Mark Murphy.\nMemories of You is the 41st recorded album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was about to turn 71 years old and released by HighNote Records in the United States in 2003. The release is a collection of blues in tribute to Joe Williams, and includes many of his hits and the standards associated with him. Norman Simmons, who worked closely with Williams, was the producer, arranger and pianist for the album. Murphy recorded the tunes in The Studio, NYC.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPeter Jones in the biography This is Hip: The Life of Mark Murphy, relates that Murphy had wanted to do a tribute to Joe Williams for a long time. In this collection Murphy is relaxed, and sings the old-style material simply, avoiding inappropriate extravagance with no need to be hip or experimental. Producer and pianist Norman Simmons had recorded five albums with Joe Williams in the 80s and 90s and selected possible tunes for Murphy to consider and did the arrangements. Murphy felt an affinity with Williams, Basie, and the urban blues and he had his own roots in the Swing Era. Murphy recalls Williams grinning at him from the wings during a show at Kent State University in Ohio, and \"Ever since then, his blues picked me up more times than I can remember\". \n\n\n== Recording ==\nMark Murphy recorded the tracks in one day, February 4, 2003. Producer Norman Simmons arranged the tunes and also plays piano. They are accompanied by Bill Easley on tenor and soprano saxophone, Daryl Hall on bass (ninth annual Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition winner), Paul Bollenbeck on guitar and Grady Tate on drums. In the liner notes Murphy says, \"A very mellow recording experience, I must say. On this I wanted everything to be copasetic and organic, like the stuff I grew up with. That's a departure. For the last few years I've been bringing in stuff that was new to me, because I liked it or had written it and so on.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn The Penguin Guide to Jazz Richard Cook assigns Memories Of You 4 qualified stars: ***(*), meaning an excellent record, with some exceptional music, only kept out of the front rank by some minor reservations. He says the album is a \"Joe Williams tribute (with Joe's old pianist Norman Simmons on hand) which suits him splendidly, the rocking Williams swing and big, hearty emoting resting comfortably on Murphy's shoulders. The voice may have frayed a little, but the mastery is absolutely intact\".\nBiographer Peter Jones calls the recording one of a trilogy of late career masterpieces, alongside Once to Every Heart and Love is What Stays. Joel Roberts says, \"Murphy delivers a master class in jazz singing and one of the best albums of his career\". Scott Yanow includes the album in his list of \"other worthy recordings of the last twenty years\" by Mark Murphy in his book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide. \nZan Stewart in a JazzTimes article from December 2003 said, the \"two slow ballads lie at the heart of the album: the last cut, \"A Man Ain't Supposed to Cry\", which had been recorded by Williams during an early '60s date for Roulette Records, and the title track, which Murphy builds with rhythmic ebbs and flows, the swallowed words and bent notes that make him so special\". Stewart comments that both Murphy and Williams \"had a way of making the words and the melody felt and believed...Murphy recalls being moved during a show at Kent State University in Ohio, when Williams had grinned at him from the wings...'I'm not considered a blues singer', admits Murphy, 'but I do love to sing the blues'. These two tracks [\"Everyday\" and \"The Comeback\"] prove it.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"The Comeback\" (Charles Frazier, Memphis Slim) – 5:22\n\"In the Evenin'\" (Leroy Carr, Don Raye) – 6:38\n\"Everyday\" (Memphis Slim) – 5:03\n\"Memories of You\" (Eubie Blake, Andy Razaf) – 5:59\n\"Just Squeeze Me \" (Duke Ellington, Lee Gaines) – 4:30\n\"If I Were a Bell\" (Frank Loesser) – 3:07\n\"Close Enough for Love\" (Johnny Mandel, Paul Williams) – 4:35\n\"Love You Madly\" (Ellington) – 3:24\n\"I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)\" (Ellington, Paul Francis Webster) – 5:21\n\"Supposin' \" (Paul Denniker, Razaf) – 3:05\n\"A Man Ain't Supposed to Cry\" (Norman Gimbel, Frankie Laine, Irving Reid) – 6:25\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nPerformance\nMark Murphy – vocals,\nBill Easley – tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone\nDaryl Hall – bass\nPaul Bollenbeck – guitar\nNorman Simmons – piano, arranger\nGrady Tate – drums\nProduction\nKatherine Miller – engineer\nNorman Simmons – producer\nJoe Fields – executive producer\nBob Barry – photography\nKeiji Obata – design\nTed Panken – liner notes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMemories of You at MusicBrainz (release group)\nMemories of You at Discogs (release)\nMemories of You at AllMusic (release)\nMemories of You at Internet Archive\nMark Murphy in MusicHound Jazz at Internet Archive\nMark Murphy in The Penguin Guide to Jazz at Internet Archive\nMark Murphy in The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Album Guide at Internet Archive\nTed Pankin Mark Murphy interviews and liner notes.",

It is held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nMeissonier's largest and most ambitious painting depicts one of the greatest victories of Napoleon, which he won over the Russian troops in the Battle of Friedland, on June 14, 1807, during the War of the Fourth Coalition. Napoleon is shown on a white horse with a raised bicorn in his right hand, accompanied by several of his officers, identified as Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Jean-Baptiste Bessières, Géraud Duroc and Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty, while inspecting the triumphant cuirassiers.\nMeissonier worked in the painting for fourteen years, from 1861 to 1875. He started by painting the sky and made separate studies for each horse and man, using, among others, wax models. The one used to paint the hussar visible in the front, on the left side of the painting, has survived. The finished work caused a sensation and was widely praised, although there were also many voices of criticism. Among his critics were American novelist Henry James and the painter Édouard Manet, who stated, jokingly, that in the painting \"everything looks like it's made of steel... except the cuirasses.\" The critic Henry Houssaye noted that the painting was fictional, since Napoleon did not review his troops at Friedland.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nBrazilian painting Independence or Death (1888), by Pedro Américo, which depicts the Brazilian declaration of independence by Pedro I of Brazil, is very similar to Meissonier's work, to the point it has been claimed to have been plagiarized by the Brazilian painter.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Royal Train Shed was part of the former Wolverton railway works in Milton Keynes, southern England. It was built in 1899 and changed use several times before it was used to house the British Royal Train from 1963 to 1991. The building has since been converted into residential use and is now a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe building is sited on an embankment built in the 1830s for the London and Birmingham Railway. The first building on the site was the original Wolverton railway station, which was demolished in the 1840s. The site is just north of the Grand Union Canal and adjacent to an 1830s bridge which was originally part of the main line and abutting the embankment it stands on is an 1830s bridge over Old Wolverton Road.The building is in red brick and has a slate roof with skylights. It is long and narrow, built to accommodate three tracks, and consists of 33 bays with gable ends. A smaller shed was built onto the north-western end of the original. Both ends have tripartite openings. The bays all have identical windows. The walls are supported by wrought-iron and steel trusses for added strength.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was first erected in 1889 as part of Wolverton railway works. It was designed by C. A. Park, the carriage and wagon superintendent for the London and North Western Railway as part of a planned overhaul of the layout of the works. It began life as a lifting shop, equipped with cranes for maintenance of carriages. It was converted to an underframe shop in 1926 and then a heavy machine shop in 1934. It was converted to house the Royal Train—which was built in the adjacent works—in 1963. It closed in 1991 After a period of disuse as the works contracted post-privatisation, the building was converted into residences.The shed was designated a Grade II listed building in 2001. Listed building status provides legal protection from demolition or unsympathetic alteration. Its list entry recognises it as \"an important component of what was in the 1890s one of the most important integrated large-scale manufacturing sites in the world\".\n\n\n== References ==",

He designed the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized web protocol, and Filecoin, a peer-to-peer file storage network.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBenet graduated from Stanford University where he studied machine learning. \nFrom January 2010 to December 2011, he was CTO of Loki Studios, leading development on the location-based multiplayer mobile game Geomon. The firm was acquired by Yahoo! in May 2013.\nBenet founded Protocol Labs in May 2014, going through the Y-Combinator incubator that summer, to support development of IPFS and related infrastructure for a distributed web. These included libp2p for network communication, and Filecoin for insuring decentralized storage. To support the Filecoin launch, Benet developed the SAFT legal framework with Marco Santori, and founded CoinList, a token sale and investment platform.\nIn 2018, Benet was named one of Fortune magazine's \"40 under 40\" in recognition of his work creating IPFS.  \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Arenaerpeton is an extinct genus of chigutisaurid temnospondyl found in the Terrigal Formation of New South Wales, Australia. The type species is A. supinatus. The genus name is derived from the Latin \"Arena\", meaning \"sand\" (a reference to the sandstone block in which the holotype was found); and \"erpeton\" meaning thing that creeps (commonly used in fossil amphibians). The species name \"supinatus\" means \"supine\", referring to the fact that the fossil is lying on its back.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nThe holotype, AM F125866, a skull and partial skeleton, originated from the Kincumber Quarry, where the Terrigal Formation is present.\nIn the October 1996, Mihail Mihaildis, a retired chicken farmer, purchased a large slab weighing roughly 1,450 kilograms (3,200 lb) for use in the construction of a garden retaining wall at his private property in Umina Beach, New South Wales. While landscaper David King was cleaning the rocks, he discovered the holotype specimen of Arenaerpeton supinatus. \nThe holotype specimen was found in 60 centimetres (24 in) to 80 centimetres (31 in) of surrounding quartz-rich sandstone.\nShortly after, Mihaildis contacted the Australian Museum, Sydney about the discovery and in 1997, it was put on display at the \"Dinosaur World Tour\", a Canadian touring exhibition, which was showing in Sydney at the time; one of the describers of the specimen, Lachlan Hart, saw the specimen while it was on display in 1997 at the age of twelve. The fossil was eventually donated to the Australian Museum in 2000.\nIn c. 2020, shortly before it was described, the holotype was taken to the facilities of the Australian Border Force so a more complete view of the skeleton could be seen by using X-ray scanners normally reserved for the inspection of cargo. Despite this, there was insufficient difference in X-ray attenuation between the fossil and the surrounding matrix, possibly due to the similar density between the quartz and the apatite of the fossil, or due to the low surviving quantity of surviving bone.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe length of Arenaerpeton was calculated to be 1.2 metres (3.9 ft); the surviving section of the holotype measures around 94 centimetres (37 in) long.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nArenaerpeton is placed in the family Chigutisauridae as the sister taxon to Kuttycephalus and Compsocerops.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPrehistoric amphibian\nList of prehistoric amphibians\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Volkart Brothers (German: Gebrüder Volkart) colloquially Volkart Brothers Importers was a Swiss merchant company headquartered in Winterthur, Switzerland primarily trading in colonial goods and cotton. Volkart was the fourth largest cotton merchant in the world, until its dissolution in 1989. Later the merchant activities merged into Paul Reinhart Ltd. Since 1951 there is the Volkart Foundation which retains the family name to this day.\nFounded in 1851, the company initially had offices in Winterthur and Bombay, Indian Empire. There were subsidiaries in Colombo (1857), Cochin (1859), Karachi (1861) and London (1868). At its peak in 1926 it employed 7,600+ people worldwide.\n\n\n== History ==\nTwo years after the repeal of the Navigation Acts for India, on February 1, 1851, the partnership Gebrüder Volkart was founded in Winterthur and Bombay by Salomon Volkart and his brother Johann Georg Volkart. The trading company imported colonial goods like cotton, tea, oils, coffee, cocoa, spices, rubber, and other colonial products from India, exporting soap, paper, matches, watches, textiles, machinery, and other industrial goods in return. The business flourished, expanding to Colombo (1857), Cochin (1859), and Karachi (1861). In 1859, Villa Wehntal, became the headquarters of the firm in Winterthur prior to moving into the Noetzlihaus in 1864.\nWhen Johann Georg Volkart unexpectedly passed away in 1861, Salomon Volkart continued the business with non-family partners. This period saw the establishment of a subsidiary in London (1868). Due to political and economic challenges, frequent changes in leadership, and his declining health, Salomon Volkart withdrew from active business in 1875, remaining a silent partner until his death in 1893. The headquarters relocated again in 1879 to the former Bank in Winterthur building. In 1905, the company built its first administrative building, the Volkart-Haus, near Winterthur's main train station.\nThrough the marriage of Lilly Volkart (1855–1916) to Theodor Reinhart, the business passed to the Reinhart family in 1912, who still oversee its operations today. By 1926, the company had 80 branches in India, making it Switzerland's primary representative there. The headquarters moved once more to Gebrüder Volkart building at St. Georgenplatz 2, near the station. The leadership returned to the Volkart-Haus in 1955. The sons of Theodor, Georg, and Werner, later joined the company, continuing their father's philanthropic efforts. \n\n\n== Mergers ==\nIn 1985, Andreas Reinhart took over the company, initiating an ambitious investment strategy that ultimately weakened the company. The company sold its coffee business to the Erb Group in 1989, operating under the name Volcafe thereafter. Until 1999, it was the world's fourth-largest cotton trader. The company also held a majority stake in the Suhrkamp Verlag until 1999. \n\n\n== Recent activity ==\nToday, Volkart's website only mentions its various foundations; the former trading giant is no longer active in business, apart from several investments.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Inspector shopping is a colloquial term referring to the deliberate manipulation of the inspector selection processes to secure more favorable outcomes or avoid unfavorable consequences during assessments, audits, and inspections. Inspector shopping involves strategically selecting inspectors based on their perceived inexperience, leniency, or susceptibility to bribery or other corruption. Individuals or entities may delay inspections until a preferred inspector is available, request a specific inspector for a job, or manipulate the selection process to ensure a desired inspector is assigned to their case. The term \"inspector shopping\" has a negative connotation and its corrupt gamesmanship and manipulation undermine the legitimacy of the regulatory process in order to obtain an unfair advantage.\nThis practice occurs in various industries, including construction, food safety, environmental regulation, healthcare, and manufacturing. Inspector shopping negatively impacts public safety, consumer protection, and environmental standards, as it leads to substandard work, dangerous products, or hazardous conditions going unnoticed or unreported. \nTo mitigate the risks posed by inspector shopping and preserve the integrity of the inspection processes, regulatory agencies and industries have implemented countermeasures including random inspector assignment, regular rotation of inspection personnel, and rigorous monitoring of inspector selection protocols.\n\n\n== United States ==\nBoeing manufacturing and design issues have been attributed in part to inspector shopping.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJudge shopping\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "OpenNap was an open-source Napster server, extending the Napster protocol to allow sharing of any media type, and adding the ability to link servers together. It became popular after the original Napster network was shut down in 2001, but was subject to similar pressures and its use soon declined. As of 2024, the WinMX client is the only one still in use.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original Napster peer-to-peer file sharing service was a protocol which allowed users to transfer files directly between their clients. The protocol was reverse engineered by a developer nicknamed Drscholl and several other programmers. The first OpenNap servers appeared in 1999, operating in the same manner as Napster servers did.  A client program connects to a centralized OpenNap server, search for, share and download files. The OpenNap server keeps track of all available files and provides clients the ability to search the index of available files and initiate a direct transfer between the clients. The files available via OpenNap servers are stored on the clients, never passing through the server. In addition, instant messages (private chat) and group chat services similar to IRC were also available.\nOpenNap servers could be interconnected with each other to form networks. Clients could connect to multiple OpenNap networks. In 2000-2001 an indexing service for all OpenNap servers was created, called Napigator. Napigator allowed server administrators to add their server to a central list, so they could be easily (and often automatically) found by client software. The network was used for research into music tastes and preferences.\nAs the RIAA began to successfully dismantle Napster in the end of 2000, the population of OpenNap began to surge. Even though it appeared OpenNap would become the next Napster, it suffered from the same vulnerability as Napster: centralized servers. During OpenNap's peak in February 2002, the RIAA on behest of its member companies, began sending “Cease and Desist” notices to the biggest OpenNap networks. OpenNap was reduced from a population of over 250,000 to little more than 50,000 in less than five months.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nopennap repository on GitHub\nopennap-ng fork of opennap on Gitlab",

        "earliest_creation_date": "2006-07-05 13:03:01",
        "content": "Hildebrand Veckinchusen (born around 1370, probably in Westphalia; died July 1426 in Lübeck) was a merchant living in Bruges at the time of the Hanseatic League. In addition to the fact that Hildebrand and his brother Sivert were among the most respected Hanseatic merchants of their time, Veckinchusen is of outstanding importance for research into the business practices and lives of merchants in the late Middle Ages due to the survival of more than 500 letters and ten trade books.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Origin and education ===\nHildebrand Veckinchusen's year of birth is not known, but is generally estimated to be around 1370. His mother's first name was \"Rixe\", his father's is unknown. There is no conclusive information about Hildebrand's origins. Luise von Winterfeld assumes that Hildebrand was also born in Dortmund based on a statement by Hildebrand that he had seen the emperor in Dortmund at the beginning of 1377 when he was a child. Dollinger considers a Livonian city more likely due to the fact that Hildebrand's third brother was a councillor in Riga and mayor between 1402 and 1408 and a Bertold Veckinchusen is documented as a councillor and later mayor in Reval (now Tallinn) between 1342 and 1353. Irsigler, on the other hand, cites an inheritance contract from 1395, recorded before the council of the town of Radevormwald in Westphalia, in which a Gottschalck Veckinchusen compared himself to his brothers Hans, Hildebrand, Sievert, the clergyman Mr. Ludwig and three sisters. The fact that the family name \"Veckinchusen\" is derived from the village of Fockinghausen near Radevormwald or from a village of the same name near Meschede also suggests that Veckinchusen came from Westphalia. In any case, the unusually high mobility of the family should be noted, as merchants of this name appeared throughout the Hanseatic region in the 14th century.\nIn his youth, Veckinchusen trained as a merchant's assistant in Livonia together with his older brother Sivert before following the latter to Flanders, where he presumably continued his training. His first commercial activities are recorded for the year 1390 in Dordrecht, where Hildebrand had himself certified at the stack that he had duly purchased two terlings of cloth and twelve bots of wine.\n\n\n=== Business and social situation around 1400 ===\nHildebrand is mentioned for the years 1393 and 1398 and Sivert for the year 1399 as an alderman of the Hanseatic trading post in Bruges, which indicates a rapid rise in business for the two brothers. This is supported by the fact that Hildebrand's first marriage was to the sister of Dortmund councillor and mayor Claus Swarte. According to Rolf Hammel, this and Sivert's ownership of three houses in Bruges, which later became the residence of the Hanseatic kontor, lead to the conclusion that the two brothers were \"among the most respected Hanseatic merchants in Flanders\" in those years.\nShortly after the death of his first wife, Hildebrand remarried with the help of his brother Caesar, who lived in Riga. In 1398, Caesar put him in touch with Margarethe Witte (around 1382 - after 1433), who came from a wealthy Riga merchant family and is described in a letter from Caesar to Hildebrand dated July 1, 1398 as a \"handsome maiden of 15 years\" (sůverlike juncvrouwe van 15 jaren). After a short stay in the house of his father-in-law Engelbrecht Witte, Hildebrand traveled to Novgorod, then fell out with Engelbrecht over a dowry of 100 marks and finally settled in Lübeck, following the example of his brother Sivert. There he obtained citizenship and married Taleke, his daughter from his first marriage, to Peter van dem Damme from a Lübeck council family around 1400, thereby expanding his circle of relations in Lübeck. However, Hildebrand returned to Bruges as early as 1402, where he remained until 1426, apart from a few short trips. However, he retained his Lübeck citizenship for the rest of his life; his wife Margarethe and his children also lived in Lübeck.\n\n\n=== Expansion and organizational structure of trading activities ===\nThanks to the analysis of business letters discovered by the economic historian Wilhelm Stieda in the last third of the 19th century, it is known that Veckinchusen was involved in a widely ramified network of trade relations from Flanders, mainly based on family ties, which spanned the entire Hanseatic region from Novgorod to London and extended south to Venice and west to Bayonne on the French Atlantic coast.\nOrganizationally, the Veckinchusens' business was often based on trading companies that were entered into with a small number of partners for a fixed period of time. This form of organization offered the advantage that larger capital could be invested and the risk for the individual could be reduced. The capital investment was usually divided equally between the individual partners and profits and losses were later also shared equally.\nUnlike in the mid-13th century, when Hanse merchants usually accompanied their goods themselves and sold them in barter, Hildebrand Veckinchusen managed his business from his Bruges office and only traveled on important occasions, such as the regular trade fairs. The goods bearing his house mark were usually entrusted to the carrier - in the case of sea trade transactions, the captain of the merchant ship concerned - or accompanied by a journeyman and sold at their destination by Veckinchusen's correspondent.\n\n\n=== Trade between Flanders and Livonia ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, Veckinchusen traded mainly with Livonia, where he shipped cloth, salt and spices and bought wax and furs in return. Hildebrand and his brother Sivert were organized into several trading companies for this trade between Flanders and Livonia. On August 3, 1405, they entered into a company together with the brothers Hartwig and Gottschalk Steenhus, whose individual transactions are described in detail in a comprehensive account by the Riga councillor Hartwig Steenhus from December 1407. According to Walter Stark's calculations, the Veckinchusen/Steenhus company made a profit of 12% in the two years of its existence, although this would not have been achieved if a single very successful transaction involving wax from Livonia to Lübeck had not made up for the losses of the other sub-operations. In 1406, Hildebrand and his brother Sivert founded another trading company together with partners in Reval and Dorpat, which, however, did not make a profit in the six years of its existence, as the profits from the sale of cloth did not offset the losses from the fur and wax trade. Irsigler attributes this to the fact that the price level for these goods on the Flemish and Livonian markets had converged too far at that time.\n\n\n=== The \"Venice selscop\" ===\n\nIn the first decade of the 15th century, twelve merchants, including Sivert and Hildebrand Veckinchusen, founded the so-called \"venedyesche selscop\" (Venetian Company) in order to establish direct contacts with northern Italy and eliminate the Venetian middlemen based in Bruges. The members of the Venetian Company transported their goods almost exclusively by land and sold the goods they bought in Venice, such as spices, sugar, brazilwood, alum and incense, on the markets of Flanders, England, the Holy Roman Empire and Scandinavia. In return, amber prayer wreaths, cloth and furs were brought to Venice. By 1409, the business of the Venetian Company was apparently doing so well that the partners Peter Karbow, Heinrich Slyper and Sivert Veckinchusen wrote a letter from Cologne to their Bruges co-partners Heinrich op dem Orde and Hildebrand Veckinchusen proposing an increase in the company's capital from 5,000 to 11,000 marks in Lübisch.\nPresumably due to the ruinous business practices of the merchant Peter Karbow, who was sent to Venice on behalf of the trading company, and his nephew of the same name, the Venetian Company fell into a crisis around 1411. Karbow purchased overpriced goods and ruined the prices on the Venetian market with an oversupply of furs, so that in April 1411 the goods purchased in Venice worth around 70,000 ducats were ultimately offset by Hanseatic trade goods worth around 53,000 ducats. Moreover, the company's large turnover could only be financed by bills of exchange drawn on partners based in Bruges, Cologne and Lübeck, which often matured before the date of sale of the goods. Added to this was the apparent dishonesty of Peter Karbow, who was finally arrested in Lüneburg in 1412. After his capture, Karbow gave up all the goods stored in Venice to society in order to buy his freedom. The ban on trade with Venice issued by King Sigismund in 1417 marked the end of the company.\n\n\n=== Lack of money and risky business ===\nThe first signs of Hildebrand Veckinchusen's business decline can be found in the reminders from his business partners from 1414 onwards, which indicate that Veckinchusen was at times in dire financial straits. Hammel attributes these problems to the losses in trade with the East caused by sales problems. Added to this was the fact that Veckinchusen did not get back his share of a loan made to the Roman-German King Sigismund in 1417 on his accession to power when he was pressed by his creditors.\nHowever, Hildebrand did not give up the risky trade with Venice. In 1417/18, he suffered considerable losses when he sent a large quantity of cloth to Venice, apparently misjudging the market situation. In May 1418, two bills of exchange drawn on London burst, foreshadowing the later catastrophe. In the late summer of 1418, Hildebrand moved to Lübeck with his family and bought a prestigious house in Königstrasse. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Bruges without his wife and children and was elected Alderman of the Bruges Kontor in 1419, which indicates that he still enjoyed credit and prestige in Bruges, at least at this time.\n\n\n=== Debtor's prison and death ===\nThe high interest rates that Veckinchusen had to pay to the Bruges-based moneylenders for the loans he had taken out up to that point made him increasingly dependent on them. Added to this was the failure of a speculation in French salt, which caused his Livonian business partners to become disgruntled. As the situation continued to deteriorate, Hildebrand used the Antwerp Whitsun Fair in the spring of 1421 to flee from his creditors. After stays in Lübeck and Cologne, however, he returned to Bruges in the fall of 1421 to attempt to repay his loans.\nBut in February 1422, at the insistence of one of his creditors, a Genoese banker, he was imprisoned in the Bruges debtor's tower for a debt of 120 pounds Flemish. In the years that followed, most of his friends turned their backs on him. His wife Margarethe, who remained in Lübeck with the children, became increasingly financially strapped and was sued out of the house by his brother Sivert's mother-in-law and lost it. Sivert only supported Margarethe and the children to the extent that they did not have to go begging, as this would have damaged his own reputation in Lübeck.\nFrom the fall of 1424, the last remaining friends of Hildebrand intensified their efforts and finally managed to secure Hildebrand's release by spending considerable financial resources and obtaining a guarantee from his son-in-law Peter van dem Damme. After his release from the debtors' prison on April 14 or 15, 1426, Hildebrand made one last attempt to pay off his creditors by resuming trading activities, but then embarked for Lübeck on May 1, 1426, at Margaret's insistence, where he died a few weeks later.\n\n\n== The source situation and editorial history ==\nThe surviving written evidence of the business activities of Hanseatic merchants is extremely poor. Of all the Hanseatic merchants of the Middle Ages, Hildebrand Veckinchusen and his brother Sivert left behind by far the most extensive source material.\n[[\nFile:Briefwechsel_Hildebrand_Veckinchusen_Titel.png|link=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Briefwechsel_Hildebrand_Veckinchusen_Titel.png%7Cthumb%7C336x336px%7CTitle page of the edition of letters published by Wilhelm Stieda in 1921.]]\nWilhelm Stieda began the first comprehensive processing of this material in the summer of 1879, around a year and a half after taking up his professorship at the University of Dorpat (now Tartu). According to his own statement, he used the semester break for a trip to Reval, after he had become aware of the letters in the city archives there through a collection of registers by Eduard Papst and Gotthard Hansen. During this stay, he found further source material himself: \"A lucky coincidence led me to discover a wooden box in the archive one day, which contained a large number of letters, also from and to Hildebrand Veckinchusen, under a thick layer of pepper, many more than had previously been recorded in the aforementioned place.\" In 1887 and 1895, Stieda published the first 35 letters as part of two treatises dealing with a monetary transaction between Hildebrand Veckinchusen and the future Emperor Sigismund and with the Veckinchusens' trade relations with Venice. The publication of a two-volume complete edition planned by Stieda, the first volume of which was to contain the letters and the second the trading books also found in Reval, was repeatedly delayed due to a lack of money, the outbreak of the First World War and unfavorable circumstances. It was not until 1921 that Stieda succeeded in publishing the letters in the volume Hildebrand Veckinchusen. Briefwechsel eines deutschen Kaufmanns im 15. Jahrhundert. With Stieda's death in 1933, the plan to print the remaining material remained unfinished. It should also be noted that Stieda did not publish all of the surviving letters. Rather, he had a whole series of original letters sent from Reval to the Rostock city archives, which he did not later publish and which are still in Rostock today.\nHildebrand Veckinchusen's thirteen trading books, which contain the individual entries of his transactions, were kept in the Reval city archives until the Second World War. It was there that the Russian historian Mikhail P. Lesnikov first inspected the materials in 1940 and received two of the books for transcription in Moscow, where he made complete copies. Lesnikov transcribed the trade books with the archive signatures Af 2 and Af 5 (today the trade books are usually referred to according to their signatures in the Tallinn City Archives catalog published in 1924, which differ in numbering from another catalog from 1896), but without any thought of publication. During the Second World War, all but two of the trade books were taken to Germany and transferred to the Göttingen State Archive Storehouse. Lesnikov made copies of the books Af 1 and Af 6 that remained in Reval at the end of the 1940s; he only found out about the whereabouts of the remaining volumes at the beginning of the 1950s. Finally, in 1959, Heinrich Sproemberg, then chairman of the \"Arbeitsgemeinschaft Hansischer Geschichtsverein in der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik\", of which Lesnikov had become a member in 1957, suggested that the materials Lesnikov had worked on be printed. In retrospect, Lesnikov himself wrote that it would have been a dereliction of duty to science if he had not \"seized the opportunity to open wide the doors to a treasure trove that had been closed for so long, such as the Veckinchusen books are for the economic historian\", as the economic-historical significance of the source could not be overestimated. In 1973, the volume Die Handelsbücher des hansischen Kaufmannes Vechinchusen (The Trade Books of the Hanseatic Merchant Vechinchusen) was finally published, an edition of the trade books Af 1 and Af 6, which cover the period between 1399 and 1415. The publication of a second volume with the subsequent trade books Af 13 (up to 1418) and Af 12 (up to 1420) was prevented by Lesnikov's death.\nIn the meantime, the historian Claus Nordmann, who died in 1942 in the Second World War, had also made copies of Veckinchusen's trade books Af 4, Af 5, Af 7 and Af 8 - independently of Lesnikov. Nordmann reported on this undertaking in an extensive essay published in the Hansische Geschichtsblätter a year before his death. For his work, he used photocopies which are now deposited in the archives of the Hanseatic City of Lübeck and which were made in 1913 when the trade books stored in the Revaler Archive were sent to Germany on the occasion of the International Exhibition for Commercial Education.\n\nUnlike Lesnikov, Nordmann planned to rearrange the individual entries in the trade books for the purpose of publication. In his own edition of the books Af 1 and Af 6, however, Lesnikov argued in favor of a faithful reproduction by pointing out that the Veckinchusen books form two groups according to their form. He described the books Af 1, Af 6, Af 12 and Af 13 as memoranda, in which the entries were made in a rather disjointed manner and apparently did not follow any classification criteria. According to Lesnikov, all other trading books are to be classified as account books, as the individual entries were made according to fixed rules.\nIn 1982, Walther Stark resumed work on the unpublished trading books, which had been in the Federal Archives in Koblenz since 1978 and had then been lent to Berlin. Although Stark was able to complete the work, the manuscript proved to be unprintable due to the many layers of corrections. For a variety of reasons, the work could not be brought to print for decades. Finally, the edition of the trading books was completed in spring 2013.\nThe Veckinchusen materials - and here in particular the numerous letters exchanged between the Veckinchusen brothers and their business friends, business partners, journeymen and relatives - also provide ample scope for social-historical research beyond purely economic-historical questions. The letters exchanged between Hildebrand Veckinchusen and his second wife Margarethe are an example of this, about which Rolf Hammel judges that the correspondence \"reveals the emotional relationship between married couples at the beginning of the 15th century like no other late medieval testimony.\" A comprehensive biographical study of Hildebrand Veckinchusen is still pending, but the material for this is now largely available in print.\n\n\n== World document heritage ==\nVeckinchusen's letters and trade books in the Tallinn City Archives are one of the 17 documents on the history of the Hanseatic League that UNESCO added to its World Documentary Heritage List on May 18, 2023. These documents, or in some cases collections of documents, were previously selected at an international congress initiated by the archives of the Hanseatic City of Lübeck and submitted to UNESCO. These are customs books, minutes of meetings, privileges and deeds from the years 1192 to 1547 from six European states.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nAuxiliary means:\n\nHans Jeske: Der Fachwortschatz des Hansekaufmanns Hildebrand Veckinchusen.

        "content": "The Glacier Park Women's Club is a women's club in East Glacier Park Village, Montana. Their clubhouse building, which is also known as the East Glacier Library and East Glacier Community Hall, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1920, a group of 23 women founded the organization to promote community service. Unlike most women's club of the time, it included a diverse mixture of members including Helene Dawson Edkins, a Blackfoot woman. Edkins later served as club president  and as their representative to the General Federation of Women's Clubs of Montana.\nIn 1928, the group received the plot of land for the building from the Great Northern Railway. In 1934, Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), Indian Division constructed the clubhouse, providing jobs to local members of the Blackfeet Nation. Because the CCC only built government buildings, the club was ineligible for that Depression era program. As a workaround, the group donated the land to Glacier County, who commissioned the building, and then deeded it back to the women after completion.\nSince then, the club continues to serve as a club, library, meeting space and social center. It raises money through a combination of donations, a county stipend for housing the library, and hall rentals for events. With those funds, the group renovated the building in 2016 to replace rotting wood. The club coordinates a long-running Christmas bazaar and hosts a variety of community events.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe CCC constructed the one-story building with Rustic architecture, albeit on a smaller scale than their projects at nearby Glacier National Park. The exterior has bulky log walls with saddle-notched post-and-beam construction. The modern green metal roof has low overhanging eves with wood shingles on the gable ends. The front of the building has a hipped open porch with a sign reading \"Glacier Park Women's Club Library\" over the entrance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of women's clubs\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Glacier County, Montana\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Borges de Medeiros Avenue (Portuguese: Avenida Borges de Medeiros) is an arterial road located in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, capital of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. It includes landmarks such as the Otávio Rocha Viaduct and the Cine Theatro Capitólio. The intersection with Andradas Street forms the Democratic Corner, an established meeting point for rallies and popular demonstrations of different kinds.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origins of Borges de Medeiros Avenue are ancient. Documents dating back to 1830 from the City Council mention Beco do Poço, a path that connected the current Riachuelo and Duque de Caxias streets. In the middle of the 19th century, there were two sections: Beco do Freitas, which ran from Riachuelo Street to General Andrade Neves Street, and Beco do Meireles, which extended beyond Duque de Caxias Street.\nOn October 30, 1871, the City Council merged the three designations and named the entire route General Paranhos Street. The road crossed a large elevation and a sharp slope, which affected traffic flow. Improvements to the layout and urbanization were planned in the 1890s. In 1894, a section was widened; in 1914, additional work was carried out.\nDuring Otávio Rocha's administration, providing a solution to the street's circulation problem became a priority, as it aimed to establish an important link between the historic center and the Menino Deus neighborhood. In 1925, construction began in the city. The route of the street was extended to 1,050 meters and the span widened to 21 meters, which required the expropriation of a large area of land and the demolition of many old buildings. In 1927, the total cost of the work was estimated at Rs$14,000.\nDue to the size of the project and the high cost, the work lasted for decades. In 1928, construction began on the Otávio Rocha Viaduct to allow the path to pass under Duque de Caxias Street. Designed by Manoel Barbosa Assumpção Itaqui and Duilio Bernardi, with sculptures by Alfred Adloff, it was completed in 1932 and listed as a heritage site in 1988.\nIn 1935, the stretch between Andradas Street and Montevideo Square was completed. In the 1940s, it reached the Praia de Belas area. At the same time, the area around the avenue began to be populated with constructions such as the Sulacap, Sul América, União and Vera Cruz buildings. After the Praia de Belas embankment was completed, the avenue was stretched to Padre Cacique Avenue.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Rio Grande do Sul\nArchitecture of Porto Alegre\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "María Inmaculada Sanz Otero (born 18 June 1977) is a Spanish People's Party (PP) politician. She briefly served in the Assembly of Madrid in 2011. First elected to the City Council of Madrid in 2015, she became deputy mayor in 2019 and acting mayor of Madrid in April 2024.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Zamora, Castile and León, Sanz graduated in business management and administration form the Autonomous University of Madrid. She joined the New Generations of the People's Party (NNGG) in 1995.\nIn 2008, Sanz became Esperanza Aguirre's cabinet chief in the People's Party of the Community of Madrid. She was elected to the Assembly of Madrid in the 2011 elections, as 54th on a PP list that elected 72 members. She resigned a month later to take office as the Government of the Community of Madrid's director general of relations with the Assembly.\nSanz was fifth on the PP list for the 2015 Madrid City Council election, and was elected. In 2019, she ran the PP campaign and was third on the list as José Luis Martínez-Almeida of her party became mayor. She then became the council's spokesperson.\nIn the 2023 Madrid City Council election, Sanz was second on the PP list behind Almeida, and was named his deputy mayor when the PP retained power, after again leading his campaign. On 7 May 2024, she took over as acting mayor for Almeida's 15-day honeymoon. She was the third woman to be mayor of the capital of Spain, and the third person to hold the office temporarily.\n\n\n== References ==",

Ibrahim's Ottoman Egyptian troops routed the troops of Pasha of Aleppo, who lost all their artillery and transports.\nHaving triumphed in Homs, Ibrahim occupied Hama and Aleppo, heading for the Belen Pass, situated between Antakiyah and Scanderoon. This pass was the key to the heart of Ottoman Turkey, Asia Minor.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\nBodart, Gaston (1908).

Kozlowski (b. circa 1923) was an American swimmer who set the world record in the 50 yard freestyle race in 1943, a record which stood for almost 11 years.\nKozlowski was from Chicago and attended Lane Tech high school,  where he already proved to be a very fast swimmer, and set a scholastic record in the 100 free.\nOn March 27, 1943, while swimming for Northwestern University, he broke the world record in the 50 yard freestyle by swimming 22.1 seconds, breaking the 20-year-old record set by Duke Kahanamoku.   Before swimming for Northwestern, he briefly attended Ohio State in the fall of 1941 and then attended Illinois University for a semester, before moving to Northwestern.  Before leaving Illinois for financial reasons, he was already swimming times in practice to equal or beat the existing records in the 50 and 100 yard freestyle races, and held the national scholastic 100 yard freestyle record of 52.4 records.    He also played football for Northwestern in the fall of 1942.Kozloswki entered the United States Army the month after setting his world record.  He indicated in a December 1944 article in a U.S. Army newspaper that he intended to return to college swimming after the war, but it is unclear if he did so.  He did swim at an exhibition meet in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin in June 1949 where he was billed as the \"world's fastest human in water.\"Dick Cleveland beat Kozlowski's 50 yard record in early 1954, swimming 21.9 seconds.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The church of San Giuseppe is a religious building located in Vigevano, in province of Pavia and diocese of Vigevano.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nIn 1881, Monsignor De Gaudenzi asked four nuns, coming from Novara, to open a boarding school for young girls in via Griona. In 1913, given the significant progress, this was moved to via Deomini. Currently the institute includes nursery, elementary, middle and high school and is run by Dominican nuns.\nAttached to the San Giuseppe institute, there is the church. Built in Carrara marble, it was the first Italian church to be consecrated to the Sacred Heart, in 1876. The small building included two altars dedicated to the Sacred Heart and Saint Joseph, with valuable paintings. However, towards the end of the twentieth century, the little church underwent various renovations, which completely changed its structure.\nInside the institute, however, there are two paintings from the Lombard school of the late sixteenth century: a Madonna in adoration with Saint Dominic, Saint Catherine and the blessed Matteo Carreri, framed by fifteen small paintings reproducing the joyful mysteries. Also interesting is a Saint Dominic receiving the rosary from Heaven, from the same period as the previous one.\nFinally, in a small room you can admire one of the last frescoes by Vittorio Ramella, depicting a Crucifixion.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 16th Mississippi Infantry Regiment was a unit of the Confederate States Army from southern Mississippi that participated in the Eastern theater of the American Civil War as part of the Army of Northern Virginia. The 16th Regiment fought in numerous battles, taking heavy casualties at Antietam and Spotsylvania Court House before surrendering after Union troops broke through the defenses of Petersburg, Virginia, on April 2, 1865.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe 16th Regiment was assembled from volunteer companies formed across southern Mississippi from March–May 1861. The companies were assembled at Corinth, initially for state service, and then mustered into Confederate service on June 17. Carnot Posey, who had served in the 1st Mississippi Rifles alongside Jefferson Davis during the Mexican-American War, was chosen as the Regiment's colonel. The Regiment left for Richmond, Virginia, on July 26, with a total original strength of 950 men and officers.\n\n\n== Virginia and Maryland, 1861-1862 ==\nIn Virginia, the 16th was initially assigned to George B. Crittenden's brigade, before being moved under Stonewall Jackson's command in May, 1862. During Jackson's Valley campaign, the Regiment fought at Cross Keys and Port Republic. The regiment was the only Mississippi unit to participate in the valley campaign, and their performance under fire at Port Republic earned them praise from General Richard S. Ewell.The 16th then moved to the Virginia Peninsula to join the Seven Days Battles against Union General George B. McClellan's forces. At the Battle of Gaines' Mill on June 27, the 16th Mississippi alongside the 21st North Carolina charged a fortified Union position, forcing the Federal troops to retreat. General Isaac R. Trimble praised the regiment in his official report, writing that \"the charge of the Sixteenth Mississippi and Twenty-first North Carolina, sustained from the first movement without a falter, could not be surpassed for intrepid bravery and high resolve.\" The regiment also fought in the last battle of the Seven Days, at Malvern Hill, and then afterward was transferred to General Winfield S. Featherston's Mississippi brigade.\nThe 16th fought at Second Manassas in late August and the Battle of Harpers Ferry in September. The Regiment then moved north into Maryland to participate in the Battle of Antietam, with Col. Posey of the 16th commanding the brigade. At Antietam, Captain A.M. Feltus reported that the Regiment was hit by a \"a murderous fire of grape, canister, shell, and small-arms.\" Of the 228 men of the regiment engaged, 144 were killed or wounded.  Afterwards the Regiment fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December. The 16th Regiment was moved to a defensive position along the Rappahannock River.\n\n\n== Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, 1863 ==\nCommanding officer Colonel Carnot Posey was promoted to brigadier general in January 1863, and Samuel Baker was promoted to take command of the Regiment. In the spring of 1863, the regiment fought at the Battle of Chancellorsville, losing their regimental colors during a charge against Union fortifications.The 16th then moved north to participate in the Gettysburg campaign, but was held in reserve until late in the evening of July 2, seeing limited action during the second day of the battle. During the retreat from Gettysburg, the Regiment fought at Hagerstown before withdrawing to Virginia. On October 14, the 16th fought at the Battle of Bristoe Station, and General Posey died after being wounded by artillery fire. Col. Samuel E. Baker of the 16th took command of Posey's brigade temporarily, before General Nathaniel H. Harris took over, leading the Mississippians at the Mine Run in November.\n\n\n== Overland campaign and Petersburg, 1864-1865 ==\nThe men and officers of the Regiment re-enlisted for the duration of the war in the winter of 1864, and the Confederate Congress passed a joint resolution thanking them for \"their patriotic resolution.\"In May 1864, the Regiment under Harris' command fought at the Battle of the Wilderness, and then the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, taking part in heavy fighting at the so-called \"Bloody Angle\". This location was the site of some of the fiercest combat of the civil war, as Union and Confederate troops made desperate attacks and counter-attacks over nearly 24 hours of continuous battle. General Harris described the intensity of the battle his brigade was engaged in: \"Thus from 7 a.m. of the 12th to 3.30 a.m. on May 13 (twenty hours) my men were exposed to a constant and destructive fire, both from front and flank, and during the hours of day to a heavy artillery fire, in which mortars were used by the enemy for the first time during the campaign. A cold, drenching rain fell during the greater portion of the day and night and the trenches were filled with water. Great difficulty was experienced in procuring supplies of ammunition, man after man being shot down while bringing it in... As an instance of the terrible nature of the fire, trees 22 inches in diameter were hewn to splinters and felled by the musketry.\" Col. Samuel E. Baker and Lt. Col. Abram M. Feltus of the 16th were both killed at the Bloody Angle, along with many soldiers of the Regiment. Edward C. Councill was promoted to colonel to take the place of the commanders killed at Spotsylvania.\nAfter fighting at the Battle of Cold Harbor, Harris's brigade was sent to the defensive lines of Petersburg, Virginia, in June. During the Siege of Petersburg, the 16th Regiment fought in numerous battles in an attempt to cut railroad lines bringing Union troops to the front lines. During the Battle of Globe Tavern, Harris' brigade charged the Union trenches, taking heavy fire and suffering numerous casualties, including Col. E.C. Councill, commander of the 16th Regiment, who died of his wounds.  The 16th continued to fight along the Petersburg lines until the final Union breakthrough on April 2, 1865. The 16th Mississippi was among the last defenders of Fort Gregg that day, holding the fortifications against superior numbers to allow the remnants of Robert E. Lee's army to retreat until they were overwhelmed by Union forces. 4 officers and 68 surviving men of the 16th Regiment surrendered after the Union breakthrough at Petersburg. The fall of Petersburg would lead to the final surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.\n\n\n== Commanders ==\nCommanders of the 16th Mississippi Infantry:\nCol. Carnot Posey, promoted to Brigadier General, died of wounds received at Bristoe Station, 1863.\nCol. Samuel E. Baker, killed at Spotsylvania Court House, 1864.\nCol. Edward C. Councill, died of wounds received at Globe Tavern, 1864.\nLt. Col. Robert Clark\nLt. Col. J.H. Duncan\nLt. Col. James J. Shannon\nLt. Col. Abram M.

        "content": "The church of San Giorgio in Strata is a religious building located in Vigevano, in province of Pavia and diocese of Vigevano.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe church was complementary to the adjacent Visconti Castle. It was built under the patronage of the Colli family.\nIt is located in via Cairoli, once via Strata, from which it takes its name. Almost suffocated by houses, it risks going unnoticed by the people of Vigevano themselves. In the 1980s, it was considered the oldest city church open for worship: in fact, the first news about it dates back to 1090; it then underwent numerous restorations, the last of which in 1968 by the architect Mario Bonzanini. According to other sources, the church dates back to the primitive Lombard age.\nAccording to a legend, the church of San Giorgio was originally not located in its current location, but inside Castello Sforzesco, so that the knights of Vigevano could go there to pray. During his stay in the city, it is said that Ludovico il Moro fell in love with a lady-in-waiting of his wife Beatrice, a young and beautiful girl who, however, did not reciprocate this feeling, preferring a squire to him. The girl and the squire then got married secretly inside the church, making an agreement with a friar, so that Ludovico wouldn't know anything about it, then they left on horseback towards Novara. However, Ludovico learned of the fact and began chasing them for over two hundred kilometers. Having surrendered, he then returned to the castle of Vigevano, beheading the friar and ordering the destruction of the chapel. The knights then decided to rebuild it, brick by brick, outside the city walls, in its current location. The reality of the facts, however, was that the church was \"moved\", dismantling it and reassembling it in the current Via Cairoli, as in its previous position it would have prevented the changes to the castle requested by Ludovico Sforza in those years.\nCarlo Stefano Brambilla wrote in this regard: \"The Chancellor Simone Del Pozzo says that the Church of San Giorgio was formerly in the Castle, but that it was destroyed by order of the Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza, and that this one was built in its place, which is currently located in Porta di Strata, called Porta Sforzesca. He does not mention the time it was built, but from the building itself it can be recognized as being very ancient. The owners say the year 1090. Mention is made of this church in the book of the Estimo of the Clergy of Novara and its Diocese made in the year 1324 with these words: Ecclesia Sancti Georgii de Viglevano pro una praebenda, as I have seen by an authentic faith of 29 October 1427\". Dal Pozzo always considered the castle to be the only part located in the center of the village, while long before him the castle was understood as the village which contained the fortress in its middle and in the highest part.\nSan Giorgio is particularly dear to the people of Vigevano, especially the students, who for generations have gone there for their \"propitiatory\" devotions, before entering the nearby high school.\nThe church is privately owned. It is currently managed by the local Ecuadorian community of the Virgin of Cisne.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== External ===\nThe façade, a cusp in lime-filled bricks, without plaster, is limited by pilasters at the ends. The bell tower, built on the left pilaster, was originally lower than the level of the other pilaster. There are three windows, one circular and two single-lancet windows, arched and slender on the inside and outside, respecting the early Christian tradition which wanted to make the environment suitable for prayer. The small door, surmounted by a blind lunette, was made by Luigi Barni in 1927 in oak wood from Slavonia.\n\n\n=== Internal ===\nThe binnacle, with a single nave with a rectangular plan and a semicircular apse, is divided into three bays of arches supported by pilasters, added in the eighteenth century. The interior was heavily remodeled in the eighteenth century, with numerous modifications and additions largely demolished in the restoration works of 1968. Among the works that disappeared or demolished in those years, noteworthy are the altarpiece depicting the martyrdom of Saint George and Empress Alexandra and the stepped altar, replaced by a more modern one.\nThe ceiling is made of wooden boards, replacing the original wooden one. The pilasters, eighteenth-century works that survived the works of 1968, act as support for the arches, from the same period, which replaced the previous wooden trusses to give greater solidity to the church. These are three-centred arches, on which the wooden beams they replaced and some floral motifs were probably once represented, covered by a patina of white tempera.\nThe apse is semicircular covered by a basin vault. There are ancient openings which were then walled up, which were once used to give light to the interior of the building. With the works of the eighteenth century, in which the floor was raised up to the first pilaster, the apse also took on the functions of choir and sacristy, returning to its original function only with the works of 1968, when the baroque altar was removed and a new one was built in that year.\nThe only surviving painting is the fresco depicting Saint George attacking and killing a dragon, only sketched, with a long pole, in front of a princess. The painting, the work of a local school painter, originally presented the figure of the saint proportionate to that of the horse; with the eighteenth-century intervention, the saint was re-proportioned based on the figure of the princess, however resulting disproportionate to the horse. The fresco, of uncertain date (13th-15th century), was restored for the last time in 1969 following the directions of the prof. Vicentini. Inside the church there was also a Saint Ambrose, later transferred to Palazzo Vescovile.\n\n\n== References ==",

Esports betting can either be done before the match starts, but in some cases, also during the live match. There are mainly 3 types of esports betting, which are; fixed-odds betting, private betting and skin/loot box betting. In some cases, esports betting can be only done on specific video game. Esports betting games may include; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends and Dota 2. In esports betting bets may be placed on such things as; match winner, tournament winner, final score, odd/evens bets and over/under bets. Esports betting isn't regulated in same way as other more traditional forms of gambling, thus sometimes the betting may be done by a minor. Esports betting differs from traditional sports betting, because of its complexity. Some competitively played video games may be rather complex to understand, while in traditional sports bettings, the sports rules are usually well acknowledged by the public.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ossanda Líber João Filipe Cruz dos Santos (born 15 September 1977 in Luanda) is a Portuguese politician of Angolan descent. She is the founder and current President of Nova Direita, a conservative political party.\nShe was an unsuccessful candidate Mayor of Lisbon and for Lisbon City Council in the 2021 local election, representing the civic movement \"Somos Todos Lisboa\".\nShe was a candidate for the European constituency in the 2022 legislative elections, and was vice-president of the Alliance party. In 2022 she founded the Nova Direita party.\nThe first time she tried to establish Nova Direita as a political party, it was rejected by the Constitutional Court due to the lack of the minimum number of 7500 signatures. The second time, in December 2023, the Constitutional Court rejected the application for registration as a political party of the New Right movement, considering that the statutes did not meet the legal requirements. Nova Direita was registered by the Constitutional Court on January 9, 2024.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLiber was born in the Angolan capital Luanda in 1977. She studied law and later moved to Paris, France, where she established her family. Having difficulty continuing her university studies due to the foreign language, she moved with her husband and her eldest daughter to Portugal, firstly to Coimbra and in 2004 to Lisbon.\nHaving interrupted her law course, Ossanda dedicated three years to audiovisual production and writing for cinema, at Restart - Institute of Creativity, Arts and New Technologies in Lisbon. She was Director of the Hola Lisboa film festival. However, due to the financial instability of the sector, Ossanda began working in the business area where she invested in Angolan and Portuguese companies.\nDuring the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ossanda began to think about \"the role of the city with people\" and gained visibility when she ran for the independent movement \"Somos Todos Lisboa\" for Lisbon City Council in 2021. She became vice-president of the Alliance Party, resigning from the position and disaffiliating in February 2022.\nIn April 2022, Ossanda Líber was involved in the creation of a new party in the country, called Nova Direita, whose signatures were delivered to the Constitutional Court in March 2023. The Nova Direita Party was registered by the Constitutional Court on January 9, 2024. The party contested the 2024 Portuguese legislative election but won no seats. It will contest the 2024 European Parliament election in Portugal.\nIn April 2024, she spoke at the National Conservatism Conference.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShe is married to Nuno Miguel Cruz dos Santos, a winemaker from Viseu. She is the daughter of António Pedro Filipe Júnior, a cardiologist, and Maria José João, a psychologist. Ossanda Líber is the mother of 4 children: Raphaela Forge, born in Paris in 2000; Charlotte Forge, born in Lisieux, in 2002; Yann Santos, born in Lisbon, in 2015; and Mariana Santos born in Lisbon in 2017.\nShe holds trinational citizenship; Portuguese, Angolan and French nationality.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n=== Legislative elections ===\n\n\n=== Local elections ===\n\n\n==== City Council ====\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNovadireita/\nMayoral candidate interview in 2021 election\nCandidate interview",

        "content": "The Royal Palace of Venice (Italian: Palazzo Reale di Venezia) is a complex of buildings located in the central St. Mark's Square of Venice, Italy, which served as the residence for Napoleonic viceroys, the kings of Lombardy-Venetia, Austrian viceroys, and finally, the monarchs of unified Italy. The use and successive modifications of the Royal Palace began in 1807 and ended in 1919 when King Victor Emmanuel III ceded the building to the Italian State. Currently, the complex is divided between the National Library of Venice, the Archaeological Museum, and the Correr Museum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before the Palace became a Palace (16th to 18th century) ===\nThe Royal Palace of Venice is housed within the Procuratie Nuove (New Procuracies), which border the southern side of St. Mark's Square, and the Marciana Library in the Piazetta facing the Doge's Palace.\nFrom 1537 to 1588, Jacopo Sansovino and Vincenzo Scamozzi built the Palazzo della Libreria, intended to house the library given to the city by Cardinal Bessarion, as well as the ridotti (offices) of the nine Procurators of Saint Mark, prestigious lifelong positions responsible for the administration of the city's sestieri.However, Venetian institutions required that the procurators live on the square. Yet, they lacked suitable housing. The Procuratie Vecchie (Old Procuracies), built between 1514 and 1538 on the north side of the square, were not used as residences but were rented out at a good price to support the city's administration. To address this issue, an old pilgrims' hospice on the south side of the square was converted into residences for the procurators, six in total, which were occupied based on seniority in the position. However, procurators often declined to reside in these spaces, citing their poor condition, dampness, and lack of light, preferring to live in their city palaces and rent out the procuracies to third parties.After various discussions and debates, it was decided in 1583 to build a new building for the procurators. Scamozzi was entrusted with the construction, following the articulation of the façade of the neighbouring library but adding an additional floor. After his dismissal in 1597, Francesco di Bernardin Smeraldi and Mario della Carità continued the works, and in 1640, Baldassare Longhena was appointed as the architect and completed the project around 1660. Originally, Scamozzi had designed three blocks with 11 arcades each, containing two apartments, one on each floor, plus the ground floor designated for shops. However, Smeraldi revised the project, creating narrower blocks with five arcades but apartments occupying all upper floors. In total, eight apartments were constructed.\n\n\n=== Napoleon’s Palace (1807-1814) ===\nAfter the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, its institutions were abolished, but not the position of procurators, which still existed. However, the New Procuracies were designated to house the headquarters of the Adriatic Prefecture, and after the creation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1805, they served as the residence for Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais and his family during their visits to the city.In January 1807, a decree was issued to transform the procuracies into a new Royal Palace, given the impossibility of adapting the old Doge's Palace. However, when Napoleon visited the city later that same year, he had to stay precisely in the Doge's Palace, as the construction had not been completed.\nThe idea of the royal palace gradually took shape, with two main focal points: to the east, in the former Marciana Library, the reception rooms of the viceroy and his quarters in the former procurators' ridotti (offices); to the west, the new imperial quarters with a grand reception hall and a monumental staircase to be built anew. To construct these last two elements, the architect Giovanni Antonio Antolini proposed demolishing the Church of San Geminiano and building an entrance portico with the staircase. The works began in 1807, but in 1810, due to the slow progress, Antolini was replaced by Giuseppe Maria Soli, who presented a radically different project. Soli proposed also demolishing the angled parts of the procuracies, leaving enough space to build an entire wing. Despite the scale of the project, its architecture was much more conservative, following the design of the New Procuracies, although an attic with a frieze representing Napoleon on the throne and fourteen statues of Roman emperors was added.The works on the so-called \"Napoleonic Wing\" were completed at the end of 1813, just a few months before Napoleon abdicated.The internal decoration of the spaces, following the exuberance of the Empire style close to Percier and Fontaine, was entrusted to Giuseppe Borsato, assisted by Giovanni Carlo Bevilacqua and Giambattista Canal. These tasks extended from 1810 to 1811 and focused not only on the reception rooms facing the square but also on the private rooms facing the lagoon and the gardens. The former ridotti in the Marciana Library, converted into quarters for Eugène de Beauharnais, were also decorated during this period (1807–1808).\n\n\n=== The Palace of the Emperor of Austria (1814-1866) ===\nWith the fall of Napoleon, the Royal Palace was converted into the residence in the city of the Lombard-Venetian king, that is, the Emperor of Austria, Francis I was able to visit it as early as 1815. Decoration work continued under Austrian rule in 1814-1817 and 1824–1829, making it the largest neoclassical undertaking in Venice for decades.From 1834 to 1838, the last major decoration campaign of the palace took place in anticipation of the visit of the new sovereign, Ferdinand I, after his coronation in Milan. Extensive transformations took place inside the \"Napoleonic Wing\" with the decoration of the staircase, the antechamber, and the creation of the grand ballroom. The palace was inaugurated with Ferdinand I's visit in October 1838.\nTwo decades later, another sovereign would stay at the Royal Palace, Emperor Francis Joseph I and his wife Elizabeth, \"Sissi\". Amidst some animosity from the Venetians following the repression of the 1848 revolts, the imperial couple was in the city from November 25, 1856, to January 3, 1857. The empress visited again between 1861 and 1862, staying seven months in the city, in semi-seclusion due to her health issues. She would visit Venice for the last time incognito in 1895.\n\n\n=== The Palace of the King of Italy (1866-1919) ===\nIn 1866, following the Third Italian War of Independence, Venice was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy. On 7 November, the new king, Victor Emmanuel II, triumphantly entered the city, and the Royal Palace was subsequently used as the royal residence of the House of Savoy. Victor Emmanuel II returned in 1875 to meet with Emperor Franz Joseph in what was once his city. King Umberto I frequently visited the city, coming in 1878, 1879, and 1891 during the launch of the battleship Sicilia. His wife visited alone in 1882 for the launch of the cruiser Amerigo Vespucci. Victor Emmanuel III also visited the city at least in 1903, 1907, 1908, and 1912, meeting with Kaiser Wilhelm II during the last two visits.In 1919, following World War I, the Crown transferred the palace to the State, which decided to dedicate part of its spaces to museum activities.\n\n\n=== A Palace forgotten (1919–2012) ===\nFollowing the transfer of the Royal Palace of Venice to the Italian State, the building was allocated to:\n\nCorrer Museum (1922), rooms facing the St. Mark's Square.\nArchaeological Museum of Venice (1926), rooms facing the Campanile.\nMarciana National Library (1929), in the former Palazzo della Libreria facing the Piazetta.\nRisorgimento Museum (1936), on the second floor.Unfortunately, a part of the historical interiors of the palace disappeared in the 1920s when, due to the installation of museums in the rooms facing St. Mark's Square, it was decided to remove the nineteenth-century decoration and expose the original ceiling beams and the bareness of the walls.\nFurther destruction took place in the 1950s, with the removal of the so-called \"General Council Chamber\" and \"Great Hall,\" both facing the St Mark's Campanile. Fortunately, the private rooms facing the lagoon were converted into offices, which, although it deteriorated them, also prevented their transformation into neutral museum spaces.\n\n\n=== A Palace shining again (2012 till Today) ===\nIn the year 2000, the Italian State transferred the former private rooms of the palace facing the lagoon to the municipality, which had been used as offices since the 1920s. A restoration sponsored by the French Committee for the Preservation of Venice was then initiated. The nine rooms restored by various sponsors were opened to the public in July 2012 under the name \"Empress Elizabeth's Rooms.\" In 2017, the restoration of three ‘ridotti’ of the Marciana Library was also completed. Originally intended for Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais, they were redecorated in neoclassical style between 1807 and 1811.In 2021, the second phase of the restoration of the private rooms facing the lagoon is completed, with the opening of fourteen new rooms (in addition to the nine \"Sisi\" rooms).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nHoward, Deborah (1980).

It was smaller, oriented differently and occupied the space of the current transept. Enlarged in 1447, it underwent a radical transformation with the total reconstruction and the change of axis between 1465 and 1470. In 1475, the bell tower whose construction had begun in 1448 was completed. In 1836 the chapels were rebuilt. In 1847, to widen Via San Francesco, the chapel of the Immaculate Conception, built in 1494 based on a design by Donato Bramante, was demolished. Between 1847 and 1856 it underwent a \"restoration\" which transformed the interior into neo-Gothic style, with the construction of the vaults to replace the exposed trusses and the raising of the roof, consequent raising the floor by one meter which was brought to street level. Between 1891 and 1903, by the architect Moretti, the Lombard Gothic design of the façade was restored with the rise of a few meters, to align with the raised roof with the nineteenth-century interventions; furthermore, the small entrances on the sides of the façade portal built during the 18th century were eliminated, the two Gothic windows were lengthened and the frame of the large round window was completed, making it larger than the 15th century one. To complete the façade, the pinnacles were redone. In 1931 the sides were also restored, bringing the transept façade back to its ancient shape. On Via San Francesco, after the portal on the right side, there is a Baroque ossuary called the \"church of the dead\".\n\n\n== References ==",

Dionysii de Vigievano. This church was also called the \"House of Alms\".\nAnother church was created on the first building, traces of which date back to the mid-fifteenth century. The construction of the new building began in 1750, the dome was built in 1780 and half a century later the bell tower was renovated. Finally, between 2007 and 2009, the building underwent a very radical restoration and the church was transformed into an auditorium.\n\n\n== Description ==\nLocated in Piazza Martiri della Liberazione, the church of San Dionigi is a building in baroque style with very ancient origins; the façade is attributed to the architect Giovanni Ruggeri. There are five altars in the building: the main one, with variegated and polychrome marbles, is placed in the centre. The floor at the entrance is made up of a granite slab that covers the tomb of the executed, which also explains the dedication of the church: in fact, there was a congregation of the same name that took care of the burials of those condemned to death.\n\n\n== References ==",

He became popular for organizing revolutions against various governments of the so-called Aristocratic Republic, leading armed groups. He was a deputy in several periods, and presided over his chamber in 1895–1896. He was also founder of the Liberal Party (1902) and director of the newspaper La Prensa in Lima.\nHis last revolutionary adventure was against the continuity plans of President Augusto B. Leguía, but after being captured in Paita, he died on the way to Callao, aboard the ship that was transporting him. A rumour spread that he died of poisoning, but it is most likely that he died of an illness. He is also remembered for promoting the industrialization of coca.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Username5243's Array Notation, also shortened to UNAN, is a notation made by Googology Wiki user Username5243. It has the format a[#]b where # is an array. It comes in multiple parts. An example of a valid array is 3[1, 2]5.\n\n\n== Parts ==\nBasic array notation: hardly even an array notation! Just the expression a[c]b for positive numbers a, b, c with a, b > 1 and c > 0, which is equal to {a,b,c}, a→b→c, and a↑cb in BEAF, chained arrow notation, and up arrow notation respectively. Intended FGH level ω.\n2-entry array notation: takes arrays with two entries. Close equivalence with BEAF, but a slight difference due to using 0 as a terminal value rather than 1. Intended FGH level ω2.\nLinear array notation: takes linear arrays. Intended FGH level ωω.\nPlanar array notation: takes planar arrays. Intended FGH level ωω2.\nDimensional array notation: takes dimensional arrays. Intended FGH level ωωω.\nHyperdimensional array notation: takes arrays where separators can have linear arrays in them. Intended FGH level ωωωω.\nNested array notation: takes arrays that contain arrays in separators. Intended FGH level ε0).\n2-entry First-order array notation: adds a separator called the first order comma. Intended FGH level ζ0.\nFirst-order comma array notation: more with the first order comma. Intended FGH level φ(ω,0).\nFirst-order dimensional array notation: adds more first order separator. Intended FGH level Γ0.\nAs the notation is ill-defined, the \"intended FGH level\" just means an intention of the growth rate with respect to an unspecified system of fundamental sequences if all issues are solved, and hence does not mathematically make sense.\n\n\n== Original definition ==\nThe basic array notation uses pretty much the same rules as Arrow notation, except it uses 0 for c in the expression a[c]b as a terminal value, but as a[0]b equals a*b, it is intended to be effectively just a different notation for the same function.\n\na[0]b = a*b\na[c]1 = a\na[c]b = a[c-1](a[c](b-1))\nHowever, the basic array notation is ill-defined by the reason explained in #Issues section. In particular, it is not actually a different notation for the same function as Arrow notation.\nNote that according to the list of numbers, arrays always solve from right to left. The second part adds a fourth rule:\n\nBase Rule: a[0,0]b = a[0]b = a*b\nPrime Rule: a[c,d]1 = a\nRecursion Rule: a[c,d]b = a[c-1,d](a[c,d](b-1))\nHyperoperation Rule: a[0,d]b = a[b,d-1]a\nSince it refers to the basic array notation, it is also ill-defined.\nThe number after the array is called the iterator, and the number before it the base.\nThe third part generalizes to multiple entries:\n\nBase Rule: a[0]b = a*b\nTailing Rule: a[#,0]b = a[#]b\nPrime Rule: a[%]1 = a\nRecursion Rule: a[c#]b = a[c-1#](a[c#](b-1))\nIf none of them apply, do the following process:\nCase A: If it is zero, go to the next entry.\nCase B: if the entry is greater than 0, decrease it by 1, then change the previous entry to the iterator, and change the iterator to the base. End the process.\nIt has the same issues as the basic array notation, and hence it and other parts are also ill-defined.\nThe fourth part adds a new separator, {1}. Case B is changed, the rest remains unchanged.\n\nCase B: If it is greater than zero, then:\nIf there is a comma before it, then decrease it by one, change the previous entry to the iterator, and change the iterator to the base.\nIf there is a {1} before it, decrease it by one, then change 0{1}m to 0,0,...,0,1{1}m-1 with the iterator zeroes, then change the iterator to the base. End the process.\nCase B is changed again in part 5:\n\nCase B: If it is greater than zero, then:\nIf there is a comma before it, then decrease it by one, change the previous entry to the iterator, and change the iterator to the base\nIf there is {n} before it where n ≥ 1, replace the previous 0{n}m with 0{n-1}0{n-1}0{n-1}...{n-1}1{n}m-1 with the iterator zeroes, then change the iterator to the base. End the process.\nA comma is the same thing as {0}.\nIn hyper-dimensional and nested arrays, the rules are the same as each other, but in hyper-dimensional arrays, separators cannot contain separators other than commas. Again, all that changes is case B.\n\nCase B: If it is greater than zero, then:\nIf there is a comma before it, then decrease it by one, change the previous entry to the iterator, and change the iterator to the base\nIf there is {n #} before it where n ≥ 1, replace the previous 0{n #}m with 0{n-1 #}0{n-1 #}0{n-1 #}...{n-1 #}1{n #}m-1 with the iterator zeroes, then change the iterator to the base. End the process.\nIf there is {0 #} before it, go into the separator and start the process from there.\n\n\n=== Issues ===\nAccording to the original source, the basic array notation assumes that the expression a[c]b is valid if and only if a, b, c are positive numbers with a, b > 1, c > 0.\nHowever, the first rule\n\na[0]b = a*b\nrefers to an expression a[0]b, which is ill-formed because it is a[c]b with c = 0. Namely, the originality that this notation allows a[0]b conflicts the restriction from the beginning.\nIn addition, the second rule\n\na[c]1 = a\nrefers to an expression a[c]1, which is ill-formed because it is a[c]b with b = 1.\nFurther, the third rule\n\na[c]b = a[c-1](a[c](b-1))\ndoes not have any restriction, and hence allows the case a = 2, b = 2, c = 1. Then the resulting value 2[0](2[1]1) is ill-formed because 2[1]1 is a'[c']b' for a' = 2, b' = 1, and c' = 1, and 2[0](2[1]1) is a'[c']b' for a' = 2, b' = 2[1]1, and c' = -0.\nWe note that even if we replaced the positivity of c and the restriction c > 0 by the non-negativity, the third rule would cause the same problem: It allows the case a = 2, b = 2, c = 0. Then the resulting value 2[-1](2[0]1) is ill-formed because 2[0]1 is a'[c']b' for a' = 2, b' = 1, and c' = 1, and 2[-1](2[0]1) is a'[c']b' for a' = 2, b' = 2[0]1, and c' = -1.\nEven if we in addition ignored the restriction b > 1, then the third rule would cause the same problem: It allows the case a = 2, b = 1, c = 0. Then the resulting value 2[-1](2[0]0) is ill-formed because 2[0]0 is a'[c']b' for a' = 2, b' = 0, and c' = 1, and 2[-1](2[0]0) is a'[c']b' for a' = 2, b' = 2[0]0, and c' = -1.\nEven if we in addition replaced the postivity of b by the non-negativity, then the third rule would cause the same problem: It allows the case a = 2, b = 0, c = 0. Then the resulting value 2[-1](2[0]-1) is ill-formed because 2[0]-1 is a'[c']b' for a' = 2, b' = -1, and c' = 1, and 2[-1](2[0]-1) is a'[c']b' for a' = 2, b' = 2[0]-1, and c' = -1.\nIn this way, replacement of the restrictions on a, b, and c does not solve the problem, and hence there should be a restriction on the third rule depending on replacement of the restrictions. For example, if we replace the restriction \"a, b, c are positive numbers with a, b > 1, c > 0\" by \"a, b, c are non-negative integers\", then it is better to assume b > 0 and c > 0 for the third rule.\nThe same issues occur for other parts than the basic array notation, and hence the whole part of this notation is ill-defined.\n\n\n==== Examples ====\nSince the alternative definition also has an issue, we just give examples of intended values.\n\n\n===== Basic array notation =====\n3[3]2\n= 3[2](3[3]1)\n= 3[2]3\n= 3[1](3[2]2)\n= 3[1]3[1](3[2]1)\n= 3[1]3[1]3\nIn case of a[1]b (assuming that there are two distinct rules applicable as follows):\nIf we apply the base rule, then 3[1]3[1]3 = 3[1]33 = 3[1]27 = 327 = 7,625,597,484,987\nIf we apply the recursion rule, then 3[1]3[1]3 = 3[1]3[0](3[1]2) = 3[1]3[0]3[0](3[1]1) = 3[1]3[0]3[0]3 = 3[1]3[0](3×3) = 3[1]3[0]9 = 3[1](3×9) = 3[1]27 = 3[0](3[1]26) = 3[0]3[0](3[1]25) = ... = 3[0]3[0]...[0]3[0]3 with 27 3's = 327 = 7,625,597,484,987\nHence if there are two distinct rules applicable to a[1]b, the base rule must be used instead of the recursion rule, since the base rule is used first, and they also return the same value for both rules.\n2[6]3\n= 2[5](2[6]2)\n= 2[5]4\n= 2[4](2[5]3)\n= 2[4]2[4](2[5]2)\n= 2[4]2[4]4\n= 2[4]2[3](2[4]3)\n= 2[4]2[3]2[3](2[4]2)\n= 2[4]2[3]2[3]4\n= 2[4]2[3]2[2](2[3]3)\n= 2[4]2[3]2[2]2[2](2[3]2)\n= 2[4]2[3]2[2]2[2]4\n= 2[4]2[3]2[2]2[1](2[2]3)\n= 2[4]2[3]2[2]2[1]2[1](2[2]2)\n= 2[4]2[3]2[2]2[1]2[1]4\n= 2[4]2[3]2[2]2[1]24\n= 2[4]2[3]2[2]2[1]16\n= 2[4]2[3]2[2]216\n= 2[4]2[3]2[2]65536\n= 2[4]2[3]2[1](2[2]65535)\n= 2[4]2[3]2[1]2[1](2[2]65534)\n= 2[4]2[3]2[1]2[1]2[1](2[2]65533)\n...\n\n\n===== Solution on base 0 =====\n0[0,3,1]2\n= 0[2,2,1]0\n= Undefined (see properties above)\n0[0,0,2]3\n= 0[0,3,2]0\n= 0[0,2,2]0\n= 0[0,1,2]0\n= 0[0,0,2]0\n= 0[0,0,1]0\n= 0[0,0,0]0\n= 0[0]0\n= 0 (see properties above)\n0[0{1}0,1]3\n= 0[0{1}3]0\n= 0[1{1}2]0\n= Undefined (see properties above)\n0[0{0,1}1]4\n= 0[0{4}1]0\n= 0[1{3}1]0\n= Undefined (see properties above)\n0[0{0{2}0{1}1}1]3\n= 0[0{0{2}0,0,0,1}1]0\n= 0[0{0{2}0,0,0,0}1]0\n= 0[0{0{2}0}1]0\n= 0[0{0}1]0\n= 0[0,1]0\n= 0[0]0\n= 0 (see properties above)\n\n\n=== Second alternative definition ===\nSince the first alternative definition of UNAN is also ill-defined by the similar issues pointed out in the section above, a Googology Wiki user DeepLineMadom also suggested to reform the definition in his website as follows: This is also ill-defined as we will explained in #Issues 3.\nA valid expression in UNAN's basic array notation is of the form a[c]b, where a, b, and c are non-integers. It has the following rules:\n\nRule 1 (base rule): a[0]b = a×b.\nRule 2 (prime rule): a[c]0 = 1.\nRule 3 (recursion rule): a[c]b = a[c-1](a[c](b-1)) if b > 0 and c > 0.\nIf there are two or more distinct rules to apply to a single expression, the lowest-numbered rule which is applicable and whose result is a valid expression will be applied.\nIn later parts beyond the basic array notation, there will be a minor difference for the rule 2 (prime rule) as follows:\n\nRule 2 (prime rule): a[#]0 = 1 for any array #.\nThe other rules remain unchanged.\n\n\n==== Issues ====\nThe reformation is also ill-defined by a similar issue, i.e. a problem related to the domain. When we refer to a \"non-integer\", we need to specify what range of numbers we are considering, e.g. rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers, and so on. Since the range is unspecified, the domain is still unclear.\nEven when we ignore the problem on the domain, the base rule and the prime rule include ill-formed expressions, because 0 is not a non-integer. Therefore, we only have the recursion rule. Then for any of natural choices of the range of numbers listed above, the complement of the subset of integers is not well-founded with respect to the decrement in the recursion rule. Therefore, the notation is again ill-defined.\nFor example, if we consider the case where the range is the set of rational numbers, then 1.1[1.2]1.3 should be a valid expression because neither 1.1, 1.2, nor 1.3 is an integer. However, the computation of 1.1[1.2]1.3 has an infinite loop\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n1.1[1.2]1.3 = 1.1[0.2](1.1[1.2]0.3) = 1.1[0.2](1.1[0.2](1.1[1.2]-0.7)) = 1.1[0.2](1.1[0.2](1.1[0.2](1.1[1.2]-1.7))) = \\cdots\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nand hence the resulting value is ill-defined.\n\n\n=== Third alternative definition ===\nAs the second alternative definition is ill-defined due to issues related to the domain, since the creator mistook the domain in his website that he wrote \"A valid expression in UNAN's basic array notation is of the form a[c]b, where a, b, and c are non-integers.\" but later the creator also fixed a typo from the second alternative definition from \"non-integer\" to \"non-negative integer\" in the same page, and hence the third alternative definition has been changed as follows (the underlined content is the difference):\nA valid expression in UNAN's basic array notation is of the form a[c]b, where a, b, and c are non-negative integers. It has the following rules:\n\nRule 1 (base rule): a[0]b = a×b.\nRule 2 (prime rule): a[c]0 = 1.\nRule 3 (recursion rule): a[c]b = a[c-1](a[c](b-1)) if b > 0 and c > 0.\nIf there are two or more distinct rules to apply to a single expression, the lowest-numbered rule which is applicable and whose result is a valid expression will be applied.\nIn later parts beyond the basic array notation, there will be a minor difference for the rule 2 (prime rule) as follows:\n\nRule 2 (prime rule): a[#]0 = 1 for any array #.\nThe other rules remain unchanged.\n\n\n==== Issues ====\nUnfortunately, this notation again lacks the definition of the domain of later parts other than the basic array notation. If we follow the restriction in the original definition, which also lacks the domain, then we have the same issue as those explained in #Issues.\nThe rules also have issues similar to the ones for the first alternative definition explained in #Issues 2. Even if those issues will be fixed in other versions, it does not mean that all issues have been solved, because there can be other issues which have not been pointed out.\n\n\n=== Forth alternative definition ===\nA valid expression in UNAN's basic array notation is of the form a[c]b, where a, b, and c are natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...). It has the following rules:\n\nRule 1 (base rule): a[1]b = ab.\nRule 2 (prime rule): a[c]1 = a.\nRule 3 (recursion rule): a[c]b = a[c - 1](a[c](b - 1)) if b > 1 and c > 1.\nIf there are two or more distinct rules to apply to a single expression, the lowest-numbered rule which is applicable and whose result is a valid expression will be applied.\nIn later parts beyond the basic array notation, there will be a minor difference for the rule 2 (prime rule) as follows:\n\nRule 2 (prime rule): a[#]1 = a for any array #.\nThe other rules remain unchanged.\nUnfortunately, Googology Wiki user DeepLineMadom pointed out that the fourth alternative definition of UNAN proposed by HaydenTheGoogologist2009 (Hayden Leung) has some \"subtle problems\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The government provided funds to support 46 men who worked in eight groups of six; each of the groups was assigned to one of the major routes around the metropolis and went out every night of the week.Like its mounted equivalent, it was intended to deter highway robbery. It became an established element of London policing in the 1780s.  Like the Horse Patrols, they ran in tandem with the new Metropolitan Police from 1829 to 1839 before being absorbed into it.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBeattie, J.

It was so successful in cutting crime that when funding stopped, highwaymen soon returned. The Patrol was not re-introduced until 1805 following a campaign by Patrick Colquhoun, better-known as co-founder of the Thames River Police.\nThe Patrols wore a distinctive scarlet waistcoat under their blue greatcoats and were thus nicknamed \"Robin Redbreasts\" (though this is often misapplied to the Bow Street Runners). Like the Bow Street Foot Patrols, they were merged into the Metropolitan Police by the Metropolitan Police Act 1839.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nHetherington, Fitzgerald Percy (1888). \"The Patroles\".

The townland, which had a population of 143 as of the 2011 census, is in the civil parish of Corcomohide and the historical barony of Connello Upper.Evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes an ecclesiastical site (known locally as \"the Abbey\"), a motte, a castle and manor house. The entry for Castletown Conyers, in A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837), associates this settlement with the Mac Einery family. Originally known as Kilmoodan, and later known as Castletown McEnery, the area became known as Castletown Conyers after the arrival of the Conyer family in the late 17th century. The Conyer family, landlords and occupiers of the estate's manor house, lived in the area until at least the late 19th century.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Throughout the duration of the Iran–Iraq War, numerous efforts were made to halt hostilities and initiate discussions on the unresolved issues that precipitated the onset of the war; however, these endeavors proved unsuccessful. Iraq put forward a suggestion for a temporary suspension of hostilities lasting four days on 1 October 1980, a mere eight days after the commencement of conflict. Iran declined the offer. Khomeini issued a response on 4 October, in which he declined the offer of a truce and directed for the conflict to persist until a conclusive victory was attained, along with seeking retribution for Iraq's \"crimes\". U.S. and Soviet officials convened in Vienna on February 21–22, 1985, with the intention of addressing the ongoing Iran-Iraq war. However, President Reagan downplayed the significance of the meeting, stating that it was primarily an opportunity for both parties to exchange perspectives.\n\n\n== Iran ==\nIranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani declared on 23 March 1981 that Iran would not agree to the ceasefire proposal until the government led by Saddam Hussein is removed from power. In the beginning of April 1981, the dominant political party in Iran, the Islamic Republican Party, asserted that it was only willing to engage in dialogue with an Iraqi government that was a \"true reflection of popular mandate\", rather than the \"current deceitful leaders in power in Baghdad\". In July 1981, Iran declined a ceasefire proposal from Iraq for the duration of Ramadan.\n\n\n== Iraq ==\nDuring a public address on 15 March 1981, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein cautioned that if Iran did not agree to a ceasefire, Iraq would offer support to Iranian dissidents. Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz attributed responsibility to Iran for initiating and prolonging the war during the fortieth session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 27, 1985. Aziz contended that Iran's explicit objective of toppling the political and social structures in Iraq and other neighboring nations in order to impose their own form of regressive, brutal governance was cited as the justification for the conflict.\n\n\n== Organization of the Islamic Conference ==\nOn 9 February 1981, the two nations agreed to host Islamic leaders in order to collaborate on an Islamic peace proposal aimed at resolving the conflict.\nOn 28 February 1981, a high-level Islamic delegation visits Tehran with the objective of securing a cessation of hostilities. Authorities, however indicate that they will not to engage in negotiations to resolve the conflict until Iraqi troops have retreated from Iranian soil. On 4 March 1981, the Islamic Peace Mission put forth a comprehensive proposal for a cessation of hostilities, involving the retreat of conflicting factions, the establishment of a collaborative Islamic armed force, and ultimately the commencement of diplomatic talks. However, the proposal was quickly rejected by both the governments of Baghdad and Tehran. On 7 March, the Iranian Supreme Defense Council formally announced its disapproval of the suggestions for a cessation of hostilities and a diplomatic resolution with Iraq. On 12 March, the Islamic peace mission acknowledged the failure of its plan.\n\n\n== Non-Aligned Movement ==\nOn 11 February 1981, the Iranian representatives left the Non-Aligned Movement conference after Sa'dun Hammadi, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, proposed a ceasefire, indicating Iraq's willingness to end the ongoing five-month conflict. Cuban Foreign Minister Isidoro Malmierca Peoli arrived in Beirut, Lebanon on 14 March 1981 to spearhead an effort by the Non-Aligned Movement to broker a ceasefire.\nA delegation from Cuba, India, Zambia, and the Palestine Liberation Organization arrived in Tehran on 6 August 1981, to attempt to resolve the conflict.\n\n\n== United Nations ==\nOn 16 January 1981, the United Nations Special Envoy Olof Palme made visits to both Tehran and Baghdad in an effort to broker a resolution to the conflict. On 17 February 1981, Olof Palme initiated his third trip to Iran and Iraq with the purpose of presenting detailed suggestions for a ceasefire and a diplomatic resolution. He departs from Tehran on 22 February following the failure of his mission. The Iranians said to him that a cessation of hostilities was not possible as long as Iraqi forces continued to occupy Iranian territory.\nOn March 1, 1982, Olof Palme proclaimed that he had been unsuccessful for the fifth occasion in persuading the two nations to agree to a ceasefire.\nOn October 31, 1983, the United Nations Security Council urged both Iran and Iraq to promptly halt hostilities in the Persian Gulf region. Iraq acknowledges the authority of the council, whereas Iran refutes it.\nOn September 27, 1984, the Japanese Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe presented a ceasefire initiative to the United Nations General Assembly aimed at resolving the Iran-Iraq War.\nOn July 18, 1988, Iran gave its approval to Security Council Resolution 598, demonstrating its compliance with international diplomatic measures.\nThe Security Council declared on August 8, 1988, that a ceasefire would take effect on August 20 at 07:00 local time, with the deployment of 350 international observers along the border. The two nations reached a consensus to dispatch delegates after five days in order to discuss unresolved matters and finalize a peace agreement through official negotiations.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Charles \"Chuck\" Paul Eisenmann (October 22, 1918 – September 6, 2010) was an American baseball pitcher and dog trainer who played in Minor League Baseball (MiLB) from 1940 to 1942 and again from 1946 to 1953 after serving in the United States Army. He is best known for being the owner and trainer of multiple dogs, most notably London, who starred in the Canadian television series The Littlest Hobo.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nChuck Eisenmann was born Charles Paul Eisenmann on October 22, 1918, in Hawthorne, Wisconsin, to German immigrant parents Richrd and Marie (Mary). He had a total of nine siblings,: 2  including two older brothers who both served in the United States Navy. Shortly following his birth, Eisenmann's family would move around and eventually settle in Parkland.: 2  He graduated from high school in 1937 and joined the Army shortly afterwards, where he became a military baseball pitcher in the Schofield Barracks league's 8th Field Artillery Regiment team while serving in Honolulu between 1937 and 1938. Eisenmann was noticed by Detroit Tigers scouts during this period, who bought him out of the military to play professionally. He boarded the SS Lurline on November 18, 1938, sailing to California.\n\n\n== Baseball and military career ==\nIn 1939, Eisenmann took spring training at the Tigers camp in St. Petersburg, Florida, where he injured his arm. While playing as a member of the Lake Charles club, Eisenmann was one of the 88 minor league players who Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis declared as free agents on January 14, 1940. The following month, on February 19, 1940, he was signed on to the Los Angeles Angels roster of the Pacific Coast League. He pitched for the team until May 13, 1940, when he was transferred to the Western International League to pitch for the Vancouver Capilanos, later moving to the Yakima Pippins mid-season, where he remained the following year. In November 1941, the San Diego Padres bought Eisenmann's contract, where he remained for the beginning of the 1942 season after showing an impressing performance during spring training. Although he became of interest to the Spokane Indians, he would re-enlist in the Army on April 11, 1942. He was sent to England as second lieutenant after graduating from training school.\nAs a member of the 827th Signal Service Battalion unit stationed in London, Eisenmann oversaw the athletics department in the Special Services Division, where he organized military baseball teams. The most notable team organized by Eisenmann was the CBS (Central Base Section) Clowns, a successful team represented by Central Base Section members of the US Army. He coached for the United States army team for the Tea Bowl I football match against Canada, which took place in London on February 13, 1944. After he was discharged in late 1945, Eisenmann returned to professional baseball, albeit he did struggle while doing so. He rejoined the San Diego Padres to play for the 1946 season, but was later assigned to the Tulsa Oilers on June 17. On June 4, 1947, he was sold by the Padres to the Memphis Chicks. Eisenmann pitched for Memphis until being picked up by the Chicago White Sox in September 1948, but was returned to Memphis after spring training the following year before having the chance to play for them. Although the White Sox recalled him in September 1949, he was part of an exchange between the White Sox and the Brooklyn Dodgers on September 30 which saw the Dodgers' Chico Carrasquel be traded for Eisenmann, Fred Hancock, and $35,000 towards the Montreal Royals. He pitched for the Mobile Bears in 1950, and in 1951 for the Triple-A International League Ottawa Giants and later the Syracuse Mets after the New York Giants bought him, later sending him back to the Tulsa Oilers in 1952, who released him after the season. He appeared in three games in 1953 as a relief pitcher for the San Francisco Seals, who released him on April 10. He appeared in an additional five games after rejoining the San Diego Padres, who then released him on April 29, ending his professional career. He then pitched for and managed the Kearney Irishmen in the Nebraska International League. In 1956, Eisenmann attended the Bill McGowan School for Umpires, but would only umpire for a single season. In August, Eisenmann started pitching for the Bismarck Barons in the Mandak League.\n\n\n== Dog training ==\nIn 1947, Eisenmann was a nightclub owner in Los Angeles, where he bought his first dog, who he named London, which was where he served in the Army. London was initially bought to be a watchdog but would instead be trained by Eisenmann and later start a career in acting. However, other sources that have also mentioned London's age would put his birth around 1953, with Eisenmann buying him Hollywood. Eisenmann taught London how to count, spell, and understand thousands of words. London was mostly knon as being a German Shepherd, but according to The Bismarck Tribune writer Curt Eriksmoen, he was actually a Tamaskan. Eisenmann would train London to perform tricks during baseball games. During a baseball game on June 26, 1955, London gave the pitcher his jacket upon reaching base, which angered two umpires later that day. An argument ensued, during which London pushed one of the umpires. The incident led to a feature on Life magazine on July 25, 1955, which gained London popularity. London was also featured on the television show You Asked for It. He was dubbed by some as being \"probably the smartest dog in Hollywood.\" In 1957, London was injured when a delivery truck collided with Eisenmann's vehicle.\nEisenmann and London would go on to spend time in Hollywood, where London appeared in the 1958 film The Littlest Hobo, which was received well by critics. London later appeared in the 1960 adventure film My Dog, Buddy as well as the 1961 film Just Between Us and Marks of Distinction. During development for My Dog Buddy, two of London's offspring were given away, with another one, a dog named Lance, performed a stunt for Just Between Us. London had three additional sons, Thorn, Toro and Little London \"Litlon\", with Thorn occasionally serving as a double actor for London. In 1961, Eisenmann filed a $35,000 lawsuit against the delivery firm who owned the truck involved in the 1957 collision. He appeared in court with London on February 27, where he alleged that London's injuries, a broken leg and a bumped head, limited his acting abilities. On March 2, the jury reached a verdict in favor of the defense.\nLondon starred in the 1963 Canadian television series The Littlest Hobo based on his 1958 movie, but by this time Eisenmann had three more dogs, Toro, Litlon and Thorn, who also played in his spot. By April 1964, London had been the father of 286 dogs, including another one of Eisenmann's dogs who was also named London. By 1966, the original London was retired, and he died at the age of 17. David Malcolmson wrote a biography about London, titled \"London: The Dog That Made the Team\". In the summer of 1967, one of the London dogs were featured on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\nToro had two sons, Hobo and London, who starred in the 1969 Romanian movie Silent Friends. By 1971, Eisenmann had another dog, Venus. London would go on to star in the 1977 comedy film The Billion Dollar Hobo. During a revival of The Littlest Hobo from 1979 to 1985, the titular Hobo was played by another one of Eisenmann's dogs, Beau.\nEisenmann wrote four books about dog training.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nIn 1946, Eisenmann lived in Superior, Wisconsin. He would later live in Kearney, Nebraska, where he spent time as a sports writer for the Kearney Hub. He moved to Roseburg, Oregon, around 1982, where he died on September 6, 2010, at the age of 91.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n1968: Stop!

        "content": "The 2024 General Tire 200 will be the 3rd stock car race of the 2024 ARCA Menards Series season, and the 62nd running of the event. The race is scheduled to be held on Saturday, April 20, 2024, at Talladega Superspeedway in Lincoln, Alabama, a 2.66 mile (4.28 km) permanent quad-oval shaped asphalt superspeedway. The race is scheduled to be contested over 76 laps.\n\n\n== Report ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nTalladega Superspeedway, formerly known as Alabama International Motor Speedway, is a motorsports complex located north of Talladega, Alabama. It is located on the former Anniston Air Force Base in the small city of Lincoln. A tri-oval, the track was constructed in 1969 by the International Speedway Corporation, a business controlled by the France family. Talladega is most known for its steep banking. The track currently hosts NASCAR's Cup Series, Xfinity Series and Craftsman Truck Series. Talladega is the longest NASCAR oval with a length of 2.66-mile-long (4.28 km) tri-oval like the Daytona International Speedway, which is 2.5-mile-long (4.0 km).\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n(R) denotes rookie driver.\n\n\n== Practice ==\nPractice was held on Friday, April 19, at 3:00 PM CST, and would last for 1 hour. For practice, drivers will be separated into different groups and will have a specified number of laps to set a fastest time. Bryce Haugeberg, driving for Fast Track Racing, would set the fastest time between all the groups, with a lap of 53.331, and a speed of 179.558 mph (288.971 km/h).\n\n\n== Starting lineup ==\nNo qualifying session was held, instead, the starting lineup will be determined by owners points from the previous season. As a result, Jake Finch, driving for Venturini Motorsports, will start on the pole.\n\n\n=== Starting lineup ===\n\n\n== Race results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Events in 1899 in animation.\n\n\n== Events ==\nDate uncertain:\nFrench trick film pioneer Georges Méliès claimed to have invented the stop trick and popularized it by using it in many of his short films. He reportedly used stop-motion animation in 1899 to produce moving letterforms.\nEarliest possible date for the production of Matches: an Appeal by the British film pioneer Arthur Melbourne-Cooper. Based on later reports by Melbourne-Cooper and by his daughter Audrey Wadowska, some believe that Cooper's Matches: an Appeal was produced in 1899 and was therefore the very first use of stop-motion animation. The extant black-and-white film shows a matchstick figure writing an appeal to donate a Guinea, for which Bryant & May would supply soldiers with sufficient matches. No archival records are known that could proof that the film was indeed created in 1899 during the beginning of the Second Boer War. Others place its creation at 1914, during the beginning of World War I. Cooper created more Animated Matches scenes in the same setting. These are believed to also have been produced in 1899, while a release date of 1908 has also been given.\nThe German toy manufacturer Gebrüder Bing introduced their toy \"kinematograph\",  at a toy convention in Leipzig in November 1898. In late 1898 and early 1899, other toy manufacturers in Germany and France, including Ernst Plank, Georges Carette, and Lapierre, started selling similar devices. The toy cinematographs were basically traditional toy magic lanterns, adapted with one or two small spools that used standard \"Edison perforation\" 35mm film, a crank, and a shutter. These projectors were intended for the same type of \"home entertainment\" toy market that most of the manufacturers already provided with praxinoscopes and magic lanterns. Apart from relatively expensive live-action films, the manufacturers produced many cheaper films by printing lithographed drawings. These animations were probably made in black-and-white from around 1898 or 1899. The pictures were often traced from live-action films (much like the later rotoscoping technique). These very short films typically depicted a simple repetitive action and most were designed to be projected as a loop - playing endlessly with the film ends put together. The lithograph process and the loop format follow the tradition that was set by the stroboscopic disc, zoetrope and praxinoscope.\n\n\n== Births ==\n\n\n=== January ===\nJanuary 13: Louis de Rochemont, American filmmaker, (producer and artistic director for Animal Farm), (d. 1978).\n\n\n=== February ===\nFebruary 15: Lillian Disney, American ink artist (Walt Disney Animation Studios), and widow of Walt Disney, (d. 1997).\n\n\n=== April ===\nApril 27: Walter Lantz, American animator, cartoonist, film director, and film producer (Walter Lantz Productions,  Andy Panda, Woody Woodpecker, Chilly Willy, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit), (d. 1994),\n\n\n=== May ===\nMay 8: Arthur Q.

        "content": "Homo ethnicus (Latin for \"Ethnic Man\") is a political manifesto that was created by the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) in May 2023. A far-right  paramilitary unit of Russian citizens, based in Ukraine. In May 2023, the RVC's leader, Denis Kapustin described himself as a \"patriot\", a \"traditionalist\", a \"right-winger\", but rejected the label \"neo-Nazi\", saying \"you’ll never find me waving a flag with a swastika, you’ll never find me raising my hand in a Hitler salute. So why would you call me that?\" Despite this, many have compared the unit's manifesto to Hitler's autobiography, Mein Kampf.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe manifesto begins with a condemnation of the average apolitical Russian, their only concern being “the disruption of consumer goods supply chains” whilst \"the Ukrainian population is under shelling and genocide\" – a condemnation common throughout the wider anti-war infosphere generally – before moving onto establishing their own understanding of the previously mentioned difference between Russkih and Rossiyanin; \"passionate national forces versus pot-bellied philistines mired in everyday problems\". In this, the RVC seeks to establish themselves as a seeming vanguard of national purity, the last remaining \"true\" ethnic Russians fighting for their conception of national liberation. The manifesto notably terms to compare races such as \"us\" and \"them\". The manifesto also rejects both Liberalism and Communism while presenting a third way – an \"Ethnic worldview\" encompassing unity by blood and by nation which was a similar ethnic world view of the Nazi party. The manifesto also talked about \"the ability to take risks and sacrifice oneself for the sake of a high ideal\". It also advocates for a pure-blooded Russian ethnostate.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nYulia Latynina compared the organization's manifesto to Mein Kampf.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was the first woman to hold a full-time appointment on the faculty of the Emory University School of Medicine, and later served as the school's dean of students.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nPapageorge was born in Istanbul, the daughter of Tomas Papageorgiou and Maria Hatzidemetriou. Her father was a Greek Orthodox priest. She moved to the United States in 1910 with her family, settling first in New Jersey and later in Georgia. Her father died in 1927. She earned a degree in chemistry from Agnes Scott College in 1927, a master's degree from Emory University in 1929, and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Michigan in 1937. Her dissertation was titled \"Studies in the intermediary metabolism of phenylalanine.\"\n\n\n== Career ==\nPapageorge taught chemistry at Emory University School of Medicine from 1929 to 1956, and was the school's first full-time female faculty member. She was also the school's first female administrator, as the dean of students from 1956 until she retired in 1975. \"I represent a mother figure to the students,\" she explained of her administrative work in the 1960s. \"They feel freer to talk to me about things that matter.\"Papageorge was named \"Atlanta Woman of the Year in Education\" for 1952. In 1966 she received the Thomas Jefferson Award from Emory. She received the Emory Medical Alumni Association's Award of Honor in 1971. A scholarship was established in her name in 1975, and the Emory Medical Alumni Association established the Evangeline Papageorge Distinguished Teaching Award in 1993, in tribute to her career.Papageorge acted with the Emory Players, and was the first woman president of the parish council at the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Annunciation in Atlanta.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nPapageorge's research on vitamins was published in academic journals including Science, Experimental Biology and Medicine, Academic Medicine, The Journal of Nutrition, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, The American Journal of Medical Technology, and Endocrinology.\n\"Excretion of Homogentisic Acid After Oral Administration of Phenylalanine to Alcaptonuric Subjects\" (1938, with Moses M. Fröhlich and Howard Bishop Lewis)\n\"An Experiment in Teaching Freshman Medical Students\" (1945, with John H. Venable)\n\"A Study of the Fasting-Hour Excretion of Thiamine in the Urine of Normal Subjects: One Figure\" (1947, with George T. Lewis)\n\"Fluorophotometric Determination of Rutin and Other Flavones\" (1947, with Anthony J. Glazko, Foster Adair, and George T. Lewis)\n\"The Effect of Oral Administration of Rutin on Blood, Liver and Adrenal Ascorbic Acid and on Liver and Adrenal Cholesterol in Guinea Pigs\" (1949, with George Lee Mitchell Jr.)\n\"Effect of hyperinsulinism on brain phospholipide\" (1951, with Eva C. McGhee, Walter Lyon Bloom, and George T. Lewis)\n\"Adrenal glycogen in the guinea pig and in the white rat\" (1955, with N. L. Noble)\n\"Loss of adrenal glycogen in the rat following stress or treatment with various hormones\" (1955, with N. L. Noble)\n\"Determination of blood cholesterol\" (1955)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPapageorge lived with her sister Calomira \"Callie\" C. Canaris, a medical technologist, for many years. She died from lymphatic leukemia in 2001, at the age of 94, in Atlanta.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA photograph of Evangeline Papageorge in 1955, from the National Library of Medicine Digital CollectionsA photograph of Evangeline Papageorge, from the Digital Public Library of America",

He played in several seasons of Cuba's national baseball series and won one of the three university championships in which he participated. He attended a faculty equivalent to motor sciences and specializing as a coach.\nAt the end of the 1990s, he abandoned high-level sporting activity due to work and in 2003 he moved to Settimo Torinese in Turin, Italy, alongside his Italian wife, where he collaborated on a project to enlarge a baseball field in the town. For many seasons the Settimo club has been represented in all youth championships, and collected regional category titles and reached the national finals several times, bringing various athletes into the academy and the regional representative of Piedmont. In September 2019, Settimo's baseball team turned in to the A category, the major one for sports in Italy. Wong also played in Milan's team, bringing the team to Serie A after major wins.\nWong died on 15 April 2024, during a workplace accident in China, which occurred on a pipe-laying ship. Wong was 50, and had worked as an industrial plumber.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wolfram Eilenberger, German philosopher and journalist, was born in Freiburg im Breisgau to government councillor Lothar Eilenberger and Eva Eilenberger, a physiotherapist. Raised in Karlsruhe-Waldstadt, he completed his secondary education at Otto-Hahn-Gymnasium in Karlsruhe. Eilenberger pursued higher education in philosophy, psychology, and Romance studies at the universities of Heidelberg, Turku, and Zurich.His academic career was notably advanced by a doctoral scholarship from the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes. In 2008, he earned his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Zurich, presenting a dissertation on Mikhail Bakhtin's cultural philosophy under the supervision of Michael Hampe.Eilenberger commenced his journalistic endeavors in 1999. His early work included contributions as a columnist to the Ethics Council of 'Die Zeit' and the sports philosophy column \"Live from the Ivory Tower\" in 'Der Tagesspiegel'. Between 2003 and 2010, he served as a philosophical correspondent for 'Cicero' magazine under chief editor Wolfram Weimer.\nIn 2011, Eilenberger was appointed editor-in-chief of 'Philosophie Magazin', a position he held until 2017 when he opted to leave to focus on literary pursuits. Since 2018, he has been a co-host of 'Sternstunde Philosophie', a philosophical program on Swiss television SRF, working alongside Barbara Bleisch and Yves Bossart. He is also a co-director of the International Philosophy Festival phil.cologne, which commenced in 2013.\nEilenberger is married to Pia-Maria Päiviö, a Fenno-Ugric scholar and former Finnish national basketball player. They have two adult daughters and reside in Berlin. His career reflects significant contributions to both philosophical discourse and public media, bridging complex ideas with a broader audience.\n\n\n== Works ==\nWolfram Eilenberger's narrative non-fiction books, which have been translated into 30 languages as of March 2023, have earned him recognition as one of the most widely translated contemporary non-fiction authors writing in German. His 2018 book, \"Zeit der Zauberer\" (The Time of the Magicians), marked a significant international breakthrough. Published by Klett-Cotta in March 2018, the book explores the pivotal decade of philosophy from 1919 to 1929, focusing on the lives and thoughts of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Ernst Cassirer, Walter Benjamin, and Martin Heidegger. It received the Bavarian Book Prize in 2018 and the prestigious Prix du Meilleur livre étranger in France in 2019. The book remained on Der Spiegel's bestseller list for over seven months and achieved bestseller status in Italy, Spain, and Denmark.\n\"Zeit der Zauberer\" garnered widespread acclaim both nationally and internationally. Critics praised Eilenberger's narrative skill and the innovative parallelization of the philosophers' lives and teachings. It was described as a \"technical masterpiece\" by The Times and an excellent integration of biography and the history of ideas by El País.\nIn the autumn of 2020, Eilenberger released \"Feuer der Freiheit\" (Fire of Freedom), focusing on philosophers Hannah Arendt, Simone de Beauvoir, Simone Weil, and Ayn Rand during World War II. Like his previous work, this book also made it to Der Spiegel's bestseller list and was shortlisted for the Tractatus Prize in 2021.\n\n\n== Additional works ==\nEilenberger's earlier works include \"Finnen von Sinnen\" (2010), a humorous account of his experiences in Finland, which quickly became a bestseller. His 2009 dissertation on Mikhail Bakhtin's philosophy, criticized for its reliance on predominantly English translations, was published under the title \"Das Werden des Menschen im Wort.\" In 2005, he published \"Philosophie für alle,\" an introduction to philosophy through everyday situations, which earned him the Mindelheimer Philosophiepreis in 2011.\nEilenberger regularly writes essays on political and cultural topics for publications like Der Spiegel, Die Welt, and El País. Since 2020, he has been writing the column \"Unter uns\" for Philosophie Magazin and occasionally hosts the philosophy program \"Sein und Streit\" on Deutschlandfunk Kultur.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nEilenberger, Wolfram (2020).

        "content": "NGC 945 is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Cetus. It is located south of the celestial equator. It is estimated to be 200 million light-years from the Milky Way and about 135,000 light-years in diameter. Together with NGC 948, it forms a gravitationally bound pair of galaxies. In the same area of the sky there are, among other things: the galaxies NGC 942, NGC 943, NGC 950, IC 230. The Type Ib supernova SN 1998dt was observed here. The object was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on November 28, 1785. It is within close proximity to NGC 948.\n\n\n== NGC 948 ==\nNGC 948 is a spiral galaxy located extremely close to NGC 945. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 4,259 ± 17 km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 62.8 ± 4.4 Mpc (∼205 million ly). NGC 948 was discovered by American astronomer Lewis Swift in 1886. The luminosity class of NGC 948 is III and it has a broad HI line. With a surface brightness equal to 14.17 mag/am2, NGC 948 is classified as a low surface brightness galaxy (LSB).\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nThe supernova SN 1998dt was discovered in NGC 945 on September 1, 1998, by T. Shefler of the University of California at Berkeley as part of the LOSS (Lick Observatory Supernova Search) program at the Lick observatory. This supernova is classified as a type Ib.\n\n\n== NGC 945 group ==\nNGC 945 is the brightest galaxy in a group of at least 7 members that bears its name. The other six galaxies in the NGC 945 group are NGC 948, NGC 950, NGC 977, MCG -2-7-20, MCG -2-7-32 and MCG -2-7-337.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInteracting galaxy\nList of NGC objects (1–1000)\nLists of galaxies\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 945 at SIMBAD\nNGC 948 at SIMBAD\n\n\n== References ==",

However, starting in 2024, in response to the increase in popularity of women's rugby league outside of Northern England, the Championship was expanded to include a Midlands and South group for teams elsewhere in the county, allowing a route to the Super League for all teams.\nThe following article summarises the results of the competition before its 2024 expansion:\n\n\n== Key ==\nSource\nKey\n  Promoted to next season's Super League  Transfer to the 2024 Northern Championship(C) Champions\n\n\n== 2017 season ==\nThe 2017 season did not begin until 23 July and as a result of this the teams only played each other once during the competition.

        "content": "The Santa Ifigênia Viaduct (Portuguese: Viaduto Santa Ifigênia) is located in the center of the Brazilian city of São Paulo. The route starts at Largo São Bento, next to the São Bento metro station, and finishes in front of the Church of St. Efigenia, connecting two of the city's historic landmarks. It is used exclusively by pedestrians.\nDesigned by architect Giulio Micheli and developed by engineers Giuseppe Chiapori and Mário Tibiriçá, the structure was produced in Belgium and intended to improve the traffic and circulation of cars, carriages and streetcars crossing the Anhangabaú Valley during the 19th century. The viaduct was built between 1910 and 1913 and inaugurated on July 26, 1913, by Mayor Raymundo Duprat.\nToday, the Santa Ifigênia Viaduct crosses the Anhangabaú Valley and Prestes Maia Avenue and connects the old and new city centers. Designed in the Art Nouveau style, the place is one of São Paulo's main postcards. Between the Santa Ifigênia Viaduct and Duque de Caxias Street, there are several stores and small galleries selling different types of electronic products, such as computers, video games, cell phones, sound and lighting equipment and musical instruments.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the end of the 19th century, São Paulo's population multiplied and its urban network expanded due to the coffee economy, which created a demand for improvements in the city's transportation and traffic. In 1901, a project for a viaduct linking Largo São Bento to Largo de Santa Ifigênia was submitted to the City Council. The project became the second viaduct to cross the Anhangabaú Valley, as there was already the Chá Viaduct, inaugurated in 1892. Construction of the Santa Ifigênia Viaduct began in 1910 and ended in 1913, during the term of Mayor Raymundo Duprat. A loan of £250,000 from the British was required for the construction of the project, representing the first foreign debt incurred by São Paulo City Hall.\nThe viaduct structure was manufactured in Belgium. Around 1,100 tons of metal structure were unloaded at the port of Santos and arrived in the area via the São Paulo Railway. Assembly work was carried out by the Lidgerwood Manufacturing Company Limited under the direction of engineer Giuseppe Chiappori, a partner of Giulio Micheli and Mário Tibiriçá. The German master builder and carpenter Johann Grundt was responsible for laying the foundations. Due to expropriations and compensation, a lack of qualified labor and a limited budget, the Santa Ifigênia Viaduct was inaugurated on July 26, 1913, a year later than planned, by Mayor Raymundo Duprat.\nBesides connecting Largo São Bento and Largo Santa Ifigênia, the viaduct's aim also included improving the traffic of cars and carriages on the slopes of the São João Avenue, XV de Novembro Street and São Bento Street, where the streetcars used to pass. In the 1970s, the viaduct was protected by a Municipal Zoning Law. It also underwent a renovation that restored the structure and made it pedestrian-only. The light fittings were replaced with old ones, the paving was changed to colored tiles and a staircase was installed to give access to the Anhangabaú Valley.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe Santa Ifigênia Viaduct is an elevated pedestrian passage over Prestes Maia Avenue, connecting Largo de São Bento to Largo de Santa Ifigênia. It has concrete bases decorated with pillars from which metal arches emerge. It was designed by architect Giulio Micheli and engineers Giuseppe Chiapori and Mário Tibiriçá. The tessellated floor on concrete slabs forms tricolored geometric carpets. There are also small ditches with metal grids to collect rainwater.\nThe Santa Ifigênia Viaduct is also accessible from a staircase paved with rubber pads in Pedro Lessa Square, where the Bandeira Terminal is currently located, next to the Mirante do Vale Building. It was built from 1,100 tons of iron from Belgium, which together create the Art Nouveau style. In 1978, it was refurbished and re-inaugurated with a promenade made with parts from the same company that had supplied the original structures. In 1982, it was painted in rainbow colors. The Art Nouveau style is visible in the viaduct's railings, which highlight the curved lines and shapes inspired by flowers and foliage.\n\n\n== Cultural importance ==\nThe Santa Ifigênia Viaduct is a 225-meter road marked by the economic and cultural progress of the city of São Paulo during the 19th century. The viaduct was designed to improve circulation within São Paulo and, over the years, it has become one of the city's main tourist attractions. Currently, it is exclusively for crossing people, connecting important points in the new and old city centers, such as Santa Ifigênia Street, Cásper Líbero Avenue, Antônio de Godói Street and Largo do Paissandú. It was the first major road project in São Paulo to be widely documented through photography.\n\n\n== Current status ==\nDespite being protected by the Zoning Law and listed as a historical and cultural heritage site in the city of São Paulo, the Santa Ifigênia Viaduct is subject to vandalism. Currently, the structure is solid but damaged. There are broken posts used as garbage cans, rust on the metal parts, loose tiles on the floor and stairs and also homeless people located in Pedro Lessa Square who live under the viaduct's roof.\nIn 2024, São Paulo City Hall announced the renovation of the Santa Ifigência Viaduct. The work includes rebuilding the slab under the tiles, waterproofing to prevent future infiltration and regularizing the base to ensure a solid and durable foundation. The work is expected to cost R$6.5 million and is scheduled for completion in August this year.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nTourism in the city of São Paulo\nCentral Zone of São Paulo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Viaduto Santa Ifigênia at Wikimedia Commons",

Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 5,594 ± 24 km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 82.5 ± 5.8 Mpc (∼269 million ly). NGC 1009 was discovered by American astronomer Edward Swift in 1886. The luminosity class of NGC 1009 is II and it has a broad HI line. To date, five non-redshift measurements yield a distance of 91.940 ± 3.045 Mpc (∼300 million ly), which is just outside the distance values of Hubble.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of NGC objects (1001–2000)\nLists of galaxies\nNew General Catalogue\n\n\n== External links ==\nNGC 1009 at SIMBAD\n\n\n== References ==",

The floods were caused by higher-than-normal rainfall.\n\n\n== Damages and casualties ==\nThe floods killed 26 people across the island, and left 11 missing. The affected included 15,500 children and 40,000 families. Scores of bridges, roads, houses, and schools across Sumatra have been affected, hampering rescue operations. Power outages and blackouts were common, and landslides buried 14 houses. In one incident, a mudslide caused a river to break its banks and flood mountainside villages in Pesisir Selatan Regency. 37,000 structures were submerged in the floods. The floods also affected 26 bridges, 45 mosques and 25 schools; destroyed 13 roads, and two irrigation system units, which in turn submerged 113 hectares (279 acres) of rice fields and 300 sq metres (3,230 sq feet) of plantation and gardens. Floodwaters waterlogged streets in Padang City. Roads were left muddy, and either collapsed or were strewn with trees. Relief efforts were hampered by persistent rainfall and blocked roads. Mud, rocks, trees, and other debris rushed down mountainsides and engulfed villages in West Sumatra.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSave the Children Indonesia, along with local help, distributed supplies in affected areas which included food, clean water, shelter kits, hygiene kits, clothes, bedding, and medicine. Abdul Malik, the West Sumatra provincial head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency, said on March 11 that \"Five hundred packages of aid including tents, blankets, water purifiers, food and hygiene kits were being distributed\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of floods\n2020 Jakarta floods\n2024 Tana Toraja landslides\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Parliamentary elections were held in Serbia on 29 October 1878 to elect the elected members of the National Assembly. The result was a victory for the Liberal Party, who formed a government led by Jovan Ristić.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe elections occurred at the end of the Serbian–Ottoman Wars and after the Treaty of Berlin, which saw Serbia officially recognised as an independent country, which was proclaimed in August. As a result of the war, Serbia's territory had expanded and the right to vote was extended to newly gained areas. As a result, a total of 129 members were to be elected, with Prince Milan able to appoint a further 43.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe Liberal Party won the elections, although had to rely on voter intimidation to ensure a majority of seats (in one area a group of police went from town-to-town threatening anyone who voted against the government). The opposition won 40 seats, many of them in eastern Serbia, which had been the area worst affected by the wars.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe new Assembly convened on 21 November in newly liberated Niš, meeting in an old primary school near the cathedral. Todor Tucaković was appointed president of the National Assembly and Vuja Vasić as vice president.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ifisashi (in Bemba) or visashi (in Chinyanja) is a traditional Zambian dish prepared with greens and peanuts. Ifisashi is most often eaten with nshima. It is considered a vegetarian dish, but meat can be added if desired. Ifisashi is a dish best enjoyed hot and is often served as a main course. In Zambia, ifisashi is accompanied by cereals such as millet, sorghum, rice, cassava, or yam when nshima is not available.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nTo cook ifisashi, ingredients such as roasted peanuts, chopped onion, tomatoes, greens, peanut oil, and water are used. The most common greens used are pumpkin leaves, sweet potato leaves, beet greens, mustard greens, spinach, collard greens, and kale. The peanuts are first ground. The ground peanuts, onion, and tomatoes are added to the boiling water. Then, the greens are added. The mixture is cooked until it reaches a thicker consistency.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dení Prieto Stock (1955–1974) was a Mexican guerrilla. Born into a middle-class family, she was exposed to left-wing politics from an early age, becoming involved in political activism in the wake of the Mexican Movement of 1968. While carrying out social work among rural peasants, she began training to become a guerrilla fighter and decided to join the armed struggle against the Mexican government after the 1973 Chilean coup d'état. She joined the National Liberation Forces (FLN) and worked on a compound to feed its guerrillas, while she completed her own military training. Her safe house was ambushed by the Mexican Armed Forces in February 1974 and she was killed, with the army burying her body in a mass grave. Her remains were recovered years later by her uncle, who re-interred them at the family tomb. In the 21st century, she has received many tributes to her memory, including from members of her own family, writers and film-makers, and the Zapatista revolutionary Subcomandante Marcos.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDení Prieto Stock was born on 8 September 1955, in Mexico City, the daughter of Mexican playwright Carlos Prieto and Jewish American Evelyn Stock. Her grandfather, Jorge Prieto Laurens, had fought in the Mexican Revolution as a Zapatista, but after their defeat, shifted towards reactionary politics and promoted anti-communism. Raised in a middle-class family, Prieto Stock was herself exposed to left-wing politics from an early age. \nShe was a keen student and particularly liked theatre and reading, her favourite author being Juana Inés de la Cruz. As a young teenager, she read the works of Leo Tolstoy, as well as the contemporary French philosophers Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault and Jacques Lacan, who she described as \"intelligent but confused\". While her friends listened to American popular music, she preferred to sing protest songs. Her sister Ayari remembered that she rescued dogs and wanted to be a zoologist, she loved chocolate and was averse to fire, she was argumentative and kept a diary in which she quoted the writer Hugo Hiriart. According to her uncle Luis Prieto, \"her parents gave her great freedom, an education with the possibility of discovering for herself sexuality, the pains and rewards of sentimental life, without guilt.\" He recalled that Ayari and Dení's mother was open about providing her daughters with oral contraceptive pills.\nDuring the 1960s, as the Mexican Dirty War broke out, she became more involved in radical left-wing activism. She was greatly affected by the Mexican Movement of 1968, as her sister Ayari was wounded in the Tlatelolco massacre. Her parents subsequently enrolled, against her will, in the private school Colegio Madrid. During this time, she engaged in social work in Tlaxcala and the State of Mexico, training rural peasants in cuniculture and soybean cultivation, teaching classes and helping to construct public infrastructure. When some of her colleagues were imprisoned, she asked her parents to pay their bail. \nOn 11 September 1973, she met her uncle Luis Prieto during a protest against the Chilean coup d'état at the Angel of Independence. She told him about Salvador Allende, his political thought and how he died. He recalled that she talked of armed struggle and had clearly been physically training. He asked if she was thinking of joining the guerrillas; she denied that she was, but didn't reject the possibility either. Although she told him that she was going to go away to study medicine, he later remarked that \"I had a hunch about what was going to happen, I knew her well, she couldn't fool me\". Her uncle remembered telling her three times: \"don't do it, you're going to sacrifice yourself\". Later that month, she told her parents that she had decided to leave home and work for the Mexican Red Cross, with which she said she would study as a nurse. But by late October 1973, she had joined the National Liberation Forces (FLN) and took up arms against the government.\nShe was confined to the FLN's safe house in Tepetlixpa, where she stayed along with six other militants, including two young girls Dení and Elisa Benavides. Together they farmed alfalfa and raised chickens and rabbits, in order to feed the guerrillas that had begun operations in Chiapas. During this period, Prieto married Sergio Morales in a revolutionary wedding presided over by the FLN. By late January 1974, Prieto and the Benavides sisters were putting themselves through military training, which consisted of classes in political theory as well as ballistics and target practice sessions.\nAround this time, another FLN safe house had been discovered by the Mexican Armed Forces, who raided the location and arrested the militants Nora Rivera and Napoleón Glockner. They were tortured for information on the location of the other safe house; Rivera initially gave them a false location, hoping that it would give her comrades time to escape, but they continued torturing her until she gave up the right location. On 14 February 1974, the Mexican Armed Forces launched a raid against Prieto's safe house. \nThey surrounded the house and forced Rivera and Glockner to ask their comrades to surrender. The standoff lasted for three or four hours and both sides exchanged fire at each other. When the militants attempted to escape, explosives were thrown at the house, causing Prieto to lose her glasses in the confusion. Prieto herself was one of the first that was killed in the ambush, dying in front of Elisa Benavides. Prieto's husband Sergio Morales and Elisa Benavides herself were the only survivors, and were arrested and imprisoned. Elisa recalled that Prieto was killed instantly, and died with a \"peaceful expression\". Her body and those of her other comrades were taken back to the capital and buried in a mass grave in the Panteón de Dolores.\n\n\n== Memory ==\nThe Prieto family was unaware that Dení had joined the FLN and were only informed of her death a week later, when the Army reported the operation in Mexican newspapers. The Mexican Armed Forces never handed over her remains to her family, nor those of the other militants killed in the raid, and they were not informed were she had been buried. In the months afterwards, her uncle Luis Prieto recalls \"bandit-police\" blackmailing and extorting money from the family, while leading them to believe that she was still alive and in detention. In 1981, the family was informed that the body of an \"unknown adult\" had been recovered from a mass grave and was going to be reburied. Luis Prieto went to the cemetery, where he recovered the bones, confirming that the skeleton was as small as Dení had been, and noticing a bullet hole in the skull. He cremated the remains and placed the urn in a church in Mexico City's avenida Cerro del Agua, together with other members of her family. Her father died in 1998, and her mother and sister moved to London.\nIn the subsequent decades, Elisa Benavides was able to piece together and record testimonies of the raid on the safe house for the prosecution of Mario Arturo Acosta Chaparro, who had organised and led the attack. In 2002, Prieto's cousin Guillermo Carillo Prieto was appointed head of the Fiscalía Especial para Movimientos Sociales y Políticos del Pasado (FEMOSPP), tasked with prosecuting human rights violations during the Dirty War.\nLuis Prieto dedicated his book Un México a través de los Prieto, which recounts the story of their free-thinking, left-wing family, to Dení. Dení Prieto was depicted in the historical fiction book Por Supuesto, written by Ignacio Retes, who received criticism from Luis Prieto over creative liberties taken with her character. Prieto's life was also the subject of the 2012 documentary Flor en otomí, directed by her childhood friend Luisa Riley. Together with Julieta Glockner, who was also killed in a clash with the army, and Elisa Irina Sáenz Garza, who has been missing since 1974, Dení Prieto is cited as one of the few women known to fought for the FLN. On 8 September 1999 and 8 March 2000, the Zapatista revolutionary leader Subcomandante Marcos paid tribute to her. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 2,210 ± 5 km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 32.6 ± 2.3 Mpc (∼106 million ly). NGC 5777 was discovered by German-British astronomer William Herschel in 1789.\nThe luminosity class of NGC 5777 is II and it has a broad HI line. It is also an active galaxy with narrow optical emission lines. To date, nine non-redshift measurements yield a distance of 44.289 ± 8.577 Mpc (∼144 million ly), which is just within the distance values of Hubble.\nA spectrum obtained on July 10, 2001, by the Isaac Newton Telescope showed a type-IIp supernova at the center of NGC 5777. SN 2001dc was formed from a group of low-luminosity events, among with other supernovae in the region.

        "content": "Cummings ist der Dichter (Cummings is the Poet) is a 1970 composition for mixed choir and instrumental ensemble by Pierre Boulez, based on a poem by E. E. Cummings.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBoulez was initially introduced to the poetry of Cummings in 1952 by John Cage during a visit to a New York bookstore. Boulez recalled that he immediately felt that he \"had a pretty direct relationship with the poetry of Cummings,\" but \"did not feel sufficiently well acquainted with the English language to tackle one of his poems.\" During the late 1960s, he considered setting five Cummings poems to music, and began composing a Cantate pour Baryton et petit Orchestre, using the poem that would eventually appear in Cummings ist der Dichter. However, he became dissatisfied with the piece, and subsequently reworked the instrumental passages into Domaines.\nIn 1970, Boulez completed the first version of Cummings ist der Dichter, a ten-minute work for mixed choir and instrumental ensemble, based on a poem titled \"birds( here inven/\", taken from Cummings's 1935 collection No Thanks. The poem is typical of Cummings's work in that it employs an unusual layout on the page, with a highly personal use of word fragmentation and parentheses. Boulez later reflected: \"what interests me is not to transcribe Cummings's discoveries literally into music, but to find a transcription of his world in my own.\" He described the resulting work as having \"a form which has its roots in the poem but which, of course, can also be grasped completely independently from the poem.\" The 1970 version requires two conductors who at times function somewhat independently, and, like a number of other compositions of this period, it employs aleatoric techniques in sections.\nIn 1986, Boulez completed a revised version of the piece which requires 16 solo voices or a mixed choir of up to 48 voices, plus an expanded ensemble. In addition, the performance indeterminacies in this version were eliminated and replaced with fully written-out passages.\nCummings ist der Dichter is unique in that it was Boulez's first and only setting of English poetry. Writer Peter F. Stacey stated that Cummings's poems \"made a refreshing change from the terse and complex poetry of Mallarmé,\", while Boulez himself would later note that his exposure to the poems helped him \"a great deal in rediscovering a certain freshness.\" Musicologist Susan Bradshaw described the work as \"an almost autobiographical reflection of the progressive developments in Boulez's musical thinking during this period: developments that were soon to explode in the creative revival of the 1970s.\"\n\n\n== Instrumentation ==\n1970 version:\n\nmixed choir of 16 voices\none flute\nfour oboes\none bassoon\nthree horns\ntwo trumpets\ntwo trombones\none violin\nthree violas\nthree cellos\none double bass\nthree harps\nSource:\n1986 version:\n\n16 solo voices or mixed choir of up to 48 voices\ntwo flutes\none oboe\none cor anglais\ntwo clarinets\none bass clarinet\ntwo bassoons\ntwo horns\ntwo trumpets\ntwo trombones\none bass tuba\nthree violins\ntwo violas\ntwo cellos\none double bass\nthree harps\nSource:\n\n\n== Premiere and publication ==\nCummings ist der Dichter was premiered during September 1970 at a concert in Ulm, Germany, with Clytus Gottwald conducting the Schola Cantorum Stuttgart and Boulez conducting the instrumental ensemble. Both versions were published by Universal Edition.\n\n\n== Origins of title ==\nAccording to Boulez, prior to the premiere in Ulm, the concert organizers contacted him and requested the title of the work so that they could print the programs in advance. He replied, in his then-rudimentary German: \"I have not yet found a title for the work but all that I can tell you now is that Cummings is the poet I have chosen.\" The organizer interpreted this to mean that the work's title was \"Cummings is the poet\" (in German, \"Cummings ist der Dichter\"), and printed the program as such. Boulez allowed the mistake to stand, noting: \"I felt there could not possibly be a better title than that, which had come about completely by accident.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a 1977 review, Arnold Whittall described the form of the work as \"fluid yet precise, unpredictable and therefore intensely dramatic,\" and commented: \"No other work of Boulez's, not even the early cantata Le Soleil des eaux, seems to me to demonstrate so clearly his personal synthesis and transformation of stylistic elements that derive from both Webern and Debussy.\" Reviewing a 2016 Proms concert, Mark Berry of Seen and Heard International wrote: \"I had the impression of a combination of certain qualities of Boulez's earlier choral music... with the different concerns of somewhat later musical language.... There was a true sense... of cummings-like wonder.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSources\n\nBerry, Mark (9 April 2016). \"The Proms Pays a Moving and Necessary Tribute to Pierre Boulez\".

        "content": "Horvat Mazad (Hebrew: חורבת מצד; also known as Khirbet el-Qasr, 'the citadel' in Arabic) is located on a strategic hill rising to a height of 530 m above sea level, overlooking the road from Emmaus to Jerusalem. Excavations conducted at the site between 1977 and 1980 revealed a long settlement sequence dating back from the Late Bronze Age to the Mamluk and Ottoman periods.\n\n\n== History ==\nHorvat Mazad foundation is attributed to the reign of Alexander Jannaeus, when a stone complex was built covering an area of 2000 square meters. It included a tower with four rooms and a courtyard. After his death, the site was abandoned and probably repopulated during the reign of King Herod. During this period, the place became a fortified Hasmonean farm and agricultural facilities were installed including plastered water cisterns and baking ovens. The mikveh, stone tools and the lack of pig bones are evidence of the Jewish character of the place which reached its peak in the first century CE, until the outbreak of the First Jewish–Roman War.\nIn the spring of 68 CE, soldiers of the Fifth Legion took over nearby Emmaus. According to the thickened walls at the site, Fisher assumes that the local residents were preparing for the arrival of the Roman Legion. He speculates that at this point the site was abandoned in light of the Fifth Legion's ascension towards Jerusalem. After the site was destroyed, the site was not inhabited. Ceramic and numismatic finds from the Middle Roman period were found at the site, which can probably be linked to Roman military activity there.\n\n\n== Archeology ==\n\nThe archaeological finds at the site indicates it was inhabited from the Late Bronze Age to the Mamluk and Ottoman periods. The first finds are attributed to the reign of Alexander Jannaeus, as the main findings include coins, a casement, carved and plastered spaces, baking ovens, fortified walls and buildings remains dating to the Hasmonean period. During this period, a mikveh was also carved. The stone tools at the site and the absence of pig bones, indicate the site was inhabited by Jews. From the Roman period, the remains of fortified walls were discovered, fragments of a milestone dating to 162 CE, is evidence of a Roman road during the days of Marcus Aurelius, as well as a coin discovered with a chariot imprint of the Legio X Fretensis.\nFrom the Crusader period, there are few ceramic findings. This proves once again that the Crusaders preferred to reach Jerusalem by other routes and not via Emmaus. From the Mamluk period as well as from the Ottoman period, ceramic findings were found that indicate the use of the site as a road station. \nA dirt road marked in red leads to the ruin from the College Forest within the Neve Ilan Forest.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHorvat 'Eqed – a nearby fortified site also connected with Hasmonean history\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "68 Million Shades... is the second album by the English musical duo Spring Heel Jack, released in 1996. It was released in the United States in February 1997. The duo supported the album with a North American tour that included shows opening for Orbital. \"Midwest\" was released as a single.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by the duo, John Coxon and Ashley Wales. They recorded from Monday to Friday, mostly from 11 in the morning until 6 in the evening. The duo felt that they complemented each other in the studio, with Wales the more easygoing of the two. They strove to create an album interesting enough to be enjoyed at home, divorced from nightlife and stimulants; they found that they kept adding musical elements to any attempt at a \"regular\" dance track. Coxon and Wales considered Ennio Morricone and Brian Eno to be among their primary influences. The duo produced a disc of remixes of the album, Versions.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Guardian noted that \"Spring Heel Jack are routinely described in the music press as studio geniuses, but this sleekly produced masterwork suggests that a state-of-the-art studio has booted out the mere humans and set its own controls for the heart of the sun.\" Robert Christgau called the album \"prog jungle,\" writing that Wales and Coxon \"recontextualize drum 'n' bass's redolent lingo—its triple-time superdrum pitta-pat, its impossible deep tremblors that modulate whole power plants in repose—by subsuming densely frenetic techno cum dancehall in a witting synthesis of electronic composition and another of Wales's passions, On the Corner-era Miles Davis.\" The New York Times said that the duo \"merges strings and horns that sound as if they come from movie soundtracks with a beat that can fluidly change from a rapid-fire drum-machine roll to a conga rhythm.\"\nEntertainment Weekly concluded that \"the record has moments of airy, disquieting tranquility... But it could double as Muzak for a department store’s Gen-X section.\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution determined that Spring Heel Jack \"is equally an inheritor of punk's do-it-yourself aesthetic and 1950s 'exotica' auteur Les Baxter's distinctly mondo notions about mood music.\" Rolling Stone stated: \"Surrounding their break beats with a reverberating drone, Spring Heel sample sweeping strings, elastic saxophone, sitar, car horns, steel guitar, piano and trumpet, as well as cryptic, treated sounds, into a reverberating clamor that is equally tuneful and enigmatic.\" Spin included 68 Million Shades... on its list of \"The 10 Best Albums You Didn't Hear in '96\".\nAllMusic wrote that the album \"continues the duo's dense, dub-inspired take on jungle.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Until January 1, 2023, it was part of the self-proclaimed \"Donetsk People's Republic\" (DPR).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== War in Donbas ===\nThe battalion was formed in 2015. The battalion took part in numerous battles of the War in Donbas such as the Battle in Shakhtarsk Raion and the Battle of Debaltseve. Two servicemen of the battalion, lieutenants Alferov N.N. and Nyrkov R.V. were awarded the title of Hero of the Donetsk People's Republic posthumously.\n\n\n== Russian Invasion of Ukraine ==\nOn 6 June 2022, the commander of the battalion, Petr Ruchyev claimed that he was losing experienced men saying: \"The enemy suffers heavy losses, but now mobilization is ongoing in Ukraine, combat effective military personnel die, and reservists immediately substitute for them. Of course, their combat effectiveness is debatable. They are captured daily. When our troops enter an enemy’s trench, the militants naturally surrender. They no longer stand their ground\". He also claimed that commanders conceals the truth about what is happening in the Donbass to preserve the morale of their troops. In January 2023, the battalion became attached to the 1st Donetsk Army Corps.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Bronze Hall Massacre (Burmese: ကြေးနန်းလူသတ်ပွဲ) was a royal massacre that occurred at the Mandalay Palace located in Mandalay in 1878 led by Hsinbyumashin, which marked a change in the history of the Konbaung dynasty.\nIt was a massacre that killed more than 40 princes and princesses, led by Hsinbyumashin, chief queen consort while the king, Mindon Min was ill. After the massacre, Thibaw Min and Supayalat succeed the throne. \n\n\n== Name ==\nInside the Mandalay Palace, there was a hall named Bronze Hall (Kyéa Nan) (ကြေးနန်း), which was built for no reason, and the princes and princesses were killed there, known as the Bronze Hall Massacre. The hall is now designated as a restricted area, and no one is allowed to enter except those who wish to study. Some people who have visited say that the hall is haunted by those who killed.\n\n\n== Background ==\nKanaung Mintha, Mindon Min's younger brother was assassinated by Myingun Prince in 1866 to get his crown prince title. Since then, Mindon Min has not given the title of crown prince to anyone. Because he thought that those who wanted power would kill anyone who had the title of crown prince. Mindon Min had blood in his bowels in 1877, a year before the massacre. Because of this, he might die soon, so the royals wanted to know who would be next king. \n\n\n== The massacre ==\n\n\n=== Beginning ===\nHsinbyumashin puts the sick Mindon Min in a private dormitory, strictly guarded, and treated by physicians. At that time, she was ruling the entire country under her husband's name. According to their royal constitution at that time, women were not allowed to be monarchs. As all three of her children were female, she conspired with the prime minister, Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung to crown Prince Thibaw (later Thibaw Min) as the successor of the throne, who was in love with her middle daughter Supayalat. \n\n\n=== Declaration and arrests ===\nHsinbyumashin had every member of the imperial family come to the Mandalay Palace without weapons in January 1878 to meet Mindon Min. \nWhen February came, the royals came to the palace as ordered. While they were waiting to see the king, an armed group led by the husband of Mandalay Thabin scholar, Ma Htwe Lay, arrived and took them inside the Bronze Hall.\n\n\n=== Murder in the hall ===\nThe group of hitmen killed the royals from 13th to 29th of February. They killed more than 40 royals by hitting the throats with bamboo sticks (some are killed by regular swords) until Mindon Min noticed their bad actions from the report of the mother of Thibaw Min, Lonshay Mipaya (လောင်းရှည်မိဖုရား), one of his consorts and other royals.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nMindon Min passed away on 28 October 1878 in Mandalay Palace. As Hsinbyumashin planned, her daughter, Supayalat became chief queen consort as she married to Thibaw Min. As Thibaw Min only interested in Buddhism (Buddha's teaching), Hsinbyumashin easily controlled the country until the British rule in Burma. However, the plan of Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung to change the country's form of government from Absolute monarchy to Constitutional monarchy did not work.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Impetuoso (English: \"Impetuous\") was an Italian Indomito-class destroyer. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1914, she served in World War I, playing an active role in the Adriatic campaign until she was sunk in 1916.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nImpetuoso was laid down at the Cantiere Pattison (English: Pattison Shipyard) in Naples, Italy, in 1910. She was launched on 23 July 1913 and commissioned in 1914.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== World War I ===\n\n\n==== 1915 ====\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Impetuoso, under the command of Capitano di corvetta (Corvette Captain) Giuseppe Sirianni, and the destroyers Impavido, Indomito, Insidioso, Intrepido, and Irrequieto made up the 2nd Destroyer Squadron. The squadron, under the command of Capitano de fregata (Frigate Captain) P. Orsini, was based at Taranto, although although either Impetuoso or Indomito or both were visiting La Spezia that day. On 9 June 1915, Impetuoso, Indomito, Insidioso, Intrepido, Irrequieto, the protected cruiser Quarto, and the destroyers Animoso, Ardente, Ardito, and Audace escorted the armored cruisers  Giuseppe Garibaldi and Vettor Pisani as they participated in the bombardment of the lighthouses at the Cape of Rodon and Shëngjin (known to the Italians as San Giovanni di Medua) on the coast of the Principality of Albania.\nOn 3 December 1915 Impetuoso , Indomito, Insidioso, Intrepido, and Irrequieto got underway from Brindisi to escort one of the first supply convoys for Italian troops in Albania. As the convoy — composed of the troop transports Re Umberto and Valparaiso, carrying a total of 1,800 men and 150 draft animals — approached Shëngjin (known to the Italians as San Giovanni di Medua) on the coast of Albania, Re Umberto, with 765 men on board, hit a mine laid by the Imperial German Navy submarine UC-14, broke in two, and sank in 15 minutes. Rescuers saved 712 men.\nOn 8 December 1915, Impetuoso and Insidioso escorted the steamship Palermo, carrying over 700 men and 43 draft animals, from Taranto to Vlorë (known to the Italians as Valona) in Albania. On the night of 11–12 December 1915 Impetuoso, still under Sirianni's command, and Insidioso escorted Valparaiso, loaded with troops, from Taranto to Vlorë.\n\n\n==== 1916 ====\nOn 23 February 1916 Impetuoso and Insidioso bombarded Austro-Hungarian artillery positions on the mountain Sasso Bianco in the Dolomites during the evacuation of Durrës (known to the Italians as Durazzo) in Albania. The same day, Impetuoso, Indomito, the protected cruisers Libia and Puglia, and the destroyer Ardito positioned themselves in the harbor at Durrës to protect the withdrawal of the \"Savona\" Brigade. Some sources claim that Impetuoso sank a Central Powers submarine sometime in the next few days, although there was no confirmation of the sinking.\nOn 9 July 1916 Impetuoso (now under the command of an officer named Ponza di San Martino) and Irrequieto set out in pursuit of the Austro-Hungarian scout cruiser Novara, which had attacked the Otranto Barrage in the Strait of Otranto and sunk the naval drifters — armed fishing boats that patrolled anti-submarine barriers — Astrum, Claivis, and Spei, but Novara reached the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Cattaro before they could intercept her.\nAt 15:30 on 10 July 1916 Impetuoso and Insidioso were patrolling the barrage when the Austro-Hungarian submarine U-17 attacked them. Impetuoso′s crew sighted the wake of U-17′s torpedo at a range of only 150 metres (160 yd), too late for her to take evasive action. The torpedo hit Impetuoso and she sank suddenly in position 40°10′N 018°50′E with the loss of 37 lives. Fifty-one men were rescued.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFavre, Franco. La Marina nella Grande Guerra.

        "content": "The Longest Shot: How Larry Kwong Changed the Face of Hockey is a children's non-fiction chapter book by teacher/historian Chad Soon and George Chiang. It is illustrated by Chinese Canadian artist Amy Qi. The book follows the life and ice hockey career of Larry Kwong, who overcame enormous obstacles to become the first player of Asian descent to play in the National Hockey League (NHL), when he played for the New York Rangers against the Montreal Canadiens on March 13, 1948. The book was first published in 2024.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nIn 2007, Chad Soon forged a lasting friendship with Kwong, extending over a decade. Their bond flourished through regular phone calls and frequent face-to-face encounters, during which Soon gleaned insights into Kwong's life journey and hockey career. Soon began a campaign to honor Kwong's hockey career with inductions into the British Columbia Hockey Hall of Fame Pioneer Award and induction into the Okanagan Sports Hall of Fame, British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame, and Alberta Hockey Hall of Fame before Kwong passed away in 2018.Upon finding inspiration in George Chiang's book, The Railroad Adventures of Chen Sing, Soon collaborated with Chiang to produce a children's book. The project gained traction when Orca Book Publishers became involved, with editor Kirstie Hudson suggesting it be transformed into a middle-grade biography.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe narrative commences by delving into Kwong's formative years in Vernon, British Columbia, where he honed his hockey skills alongside his older siblings and local peers on frozen ponds. Rising to prominence, Kwong emerged as the standout player for his hometown team, the Vernon Hydrophones, guiding them to three consecutive appearances in the British Columbia provincial hockey championships, clinching victory twice. He earned the moniker \"China Clipper,\" propelling him to join the esteemed Trail Smoke Eaters during 1941–42, where he ascended to their top line until the team disbanded due to World War 2.\nDrafted into the Canadian military, Kwong showcased his talents in the Canadian military league for the Red Deer Army Wheelers, pitting his skills against NHL stars. Kwong then caught the eye of the New York Rangers, who extended an invitation to join their farm team, the New York Rovers. Kwong's electrifying presence on the ice captivated Chinese American fans, significantly boosting the Rovers' attendance from 2500 to 15000 per game at Madison Square Garden. Despite his stellar play, Kwong's debut in the NHL was long overdue. Finally, on March 13, 1948, against the Montreal Canadiens, Kwong made his NHL debut, albeit with a brief appearance late in the third period. Regrettably, that single one minute shift marked the zenith of his NHL career, as he was promptly reassigned to the Rovers following the game.\nKwong moved on and emerged as the linchpin for the Valleyfield Braves in the Quebec Senior Hockey League, where he showcased his prowess for numerous seasons. His illustrious career culminated in Europe, where he not only excelled as a player but also assumed coaching responsibilities in the Swiss league.The narrative extensively examines the pervasive racism that Larry Kwong confronted, both in his personal life and professional hockey career, which tragically thwarted his prospects of a sustained NHL tenure. It contextualizes Kwong's experiences within the broader historical backdrop of systemic discrimination against Chinese Canadians and Chinese Americans, exemplified by legislative measures such as the Chinese Head Tax and Chinese Exclusion Act. This examination sheds light on the enduring challenges faced by marginalized communities in overcoming barriers to inclusion and equality within society and sports.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2024 Junior Library Guild Gold Standards Selection \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAuthor's website",

        "content": "A nitroplast is an organelle found in certain species of algae, particularly in Braarudosphaera bigelowii. It plays a crucial role in nitrogen fixation, a process previously thought to be exclusive to bacteria and archaea. The discovery of nitroplasts has significant implications for both cellular biology and agricultural science.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe existence of nitroplasts was first proposed by researchers studying the interaction between the marine algae Braarudosphaera bigelowii and a bacterium called UCYN-A in 2012. Initially, it was hypothesized that UCYN-A facilitated nitrogen fixation, providing compounds like ammonia to the algae. However, subsequent studies led by ocean ecologist Jonathan Zehr at the University of California, Santa Cruz, revealed that UCYN-A should not be considered separate organisms, but organelles within the algae.\n\n\n== Structure and function ==\nNitroplasts exhibit typical organelle characteristics, meeting two key criteria: they are inherited through cell division and rely on proteins provided by the host cell. Through imaging studies, researchers observed that nitroplasts divide along with the host cell, ensuring their passage to the daughter cells.\n\n\n== Implications ==\nThe discovery of nitroplasts challenges previous notions about the exclusivity of nitrogen fixation to prokaryotic organisms. Understanding the structure and function of nitroplasts opens up possibilities for genetic engineering in plants. By incorporating genes responsible for nitroplast function, researchers aim to develop crops capable of fixing their own nitrogen, potentially reducing the need for nitrogen-based fertilizers and mitigating environmental damage.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCoale, Tyler H; Loconte, Valentina; Turk-Kubo, Kendra A and; Vanslembrouck, Bieke; Mak, Wing Kwan Esther; Cheung, Shunyan; Ekman, Axel; Chen, Jian-Hua; Hagino, Kyoko and; Takano, Yoshihito; Nishimura, Tomohiro; Adachi, Masao and; Le Gros, Mark; Larabell, Carolyn; Zehr, Jonathan P (April 2024). \"Nitrogen-fixing organelle in a marine alga\".

In 1898 the 1st Vermont Infantry Regiment was stationed there for the Spanish-American War. In 1900 the Vermont National Guard took possession. The site was then renamed to Camp Olympia. It was later named for successive Governors and used for unit training and a staging area for mobilization. In 1945 the State Reservation permanently renamed Camp Olympia to Camp Johnson to honor Herbert T.

He published the \"Lezioni mediche per i naviganti\" (Medical lessons for seafarers) in 1855 that dealt with medical issues associated with seafaring. One of his innovations was a patented system of using two balloons to resuscitate drowning victims. \n\n\n== Life and work ==\nGiacich was born in Lovran in a Jačić family, his father Ivan (Giovanni) Nepomuk and mother Eleonore née Segner had moved from somewhere near Montenegro who had moved into Liburnia. He studied at the royal high school in Zadar where he stayed with an older sister. In 1832 he passed the matriculation and went to study medicine in Vienna and Padua and qualified in 1838. His thesis \"De acu pressore\" described a specially designed needle for piercing arteries for therapeutic purposes. He then worked in Istria, Dalmatia and at the city hospital in Trieste before moving to Rijeka (or Fiume) in 1839. Here he worked at the St. Duha where he became well known and rose to become the director, serving until 1885. He wrote popular articles on medicine and specialized in ophthalmology and obstetrics. He promoted the idea of making the Optaija Riviera into a health spa destination in 1847. He also spent time on examining medical issues associated with seafarers after the 1851 congress in maritime medicine in Paris suggested that each country produce their own manual. The Habsburg Kingdom assigned the task to Giacich who also taught at the Naval Academy in Rijeka. He developed a device for identifying color blindness for naval recruitment. Other contributions included his work on the use of carbolic acid for asepsis and the use of iodine for debridement prior to surgery, a technique that was used in wartime Libya in 1912. He patented a system of rubber bellows for use in artificial respiration. He also worked as a city sanitary commissioner and was involved in syphilis and cholera management. In 1912 Giacich received the Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy and a stamp with his portrait was released in 1919. Giacich also took an interest in theatre and wrote a four-act drama La donna fatale. He is buried in Rijeka.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLezioni mediche per i naviganti (1855)",

It consolidated with the now-defunct Eden Independent School District to form the Eden Consolidated Independent School District.\n\n\n== History ==\nA $30,000 11-grade concrete school building was built on Eola after a bond passed.Eola ISD consolidated into Eden ISD to form the Eden CISD in April 1983 in spite of the communities' 24 miles (39 km) distance. Eola ISD property was then sold off and the revenue was used to cover costs of transferring equipment to Eden. This caused overcrowding and resulted in the new district buying a new building using surplus cash.The consolidation took effect on September 1, 1983.At the time of its closing, Eola ISD had 118 students. It offered no music or football programs and lacked academic programming beyond basic courses. By the early 1980s, the school district was struggling financially and sought another district willing to consolidate with little success. Voters later approved consolidation with the bordering Eden Independent School District and the Eola schools were shut down.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Kurdish–Turkish relations covers the historical relations between Kurds and Turks.\n\n\n== Seljuk Empire ==\nRelations began when Alp Arslan was seeking to pass through Kurdistan in order to conquer Anatolia. While preparing for the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, Alp Arslan earned the trust of powerful Kurdish principalities and tribes, and the Battle of Manzikert was as important to Kurds as it was to Turks. The Seljuks under Ahmad Sanjar annexed the many Kurdish principalities, and united them into one large province called Kurdistan around 1150, which included Ecbatana (Hamadan), Sinjar, Shahrazur, Dinavar, and Kermanshah.\n\n\n== Ayyubid Sultanate ==\nThe Ayyubid dynasty was founded by Shirkuh, a Kurdish retainer of the Zengid prince Nur al-Din. Shirkuh was succeeded by his nephew Saladin. Under Saladin, the Ayyubids fought and defeated the Zengids. They also took control of Damascus, Baalbek, and Homs. Gökböri was the commander of the right wing of the Zengid army, and he broke the Ayyubid left wing before being defeated by Saladin's personal guards. Gökböri switched to the Ayyubid army when it was clear the Zengids were going to be defeated.\n\n\n== Ottoman Empire ==\nThe Safavids had control of Eastern Anatolia and had severely persecuted Kurds for being Sunni, which led to Selim I launching a campaign to annex Kurdish lands from the Safavids. Kurds were staunch allies of the Ottomans during the Battle of Chaldiran. The Kurdish forces also played a big role in taking Diyarbakır. The Kurds were known as the \"Black Nation\" while Oghuz Turks were known as the \"Grey Nation\". After the Ottomans won Eastern Anatolia, Selim I rewarded the Kurds with tax and military exemptions when needed, as well as semi-autonomous status, which was protected and recognized by the Ottomans. The autonomy lasted from 1514 until the mid-1800s. During 1829–1830, Mahmud II launched reforms which were so nationalistic they inspired the ideology of the Turkish National Movement. However, the vast majority of Kurds remained loyal to the Ottoman Empire until the 1900s when its Turkish nationalism increased under the Young Turks, sparking some Kurdish revolts. Abdul Hamid II was among the most pro-Kurdish of the Ottoman sultans, and in turn he was very loved by Kurds. Kurds also formed the majority of the Hamidiye cavalry and often harassed Ottoman Armenians. Kurds and Turks were united during and after World War I, solely under their shared religion, Islam.\n\n\n== Republic of Turkey ==\nWhen many Turks began embracing Turkish nationalism towards the Turkish War of Independence, many Kurds felt betrayed and thus became disenchanted from both Turks and their plans. This paved the way for the Kurdish–Turkish conflict beginning in 1922. The general relations between Turks and Kurds have been negative since the formation of the Republic in 1923. Per article 66 of the Turkish constitution, the existence of Kurds and their language was and still is denied. The term Kurdistan was also banned, even though it was never a separatist nor a provocative term at first, and was even used by Turks themself to refer to Kurdish lands, although its usage was and became a taboo as a result of Kemalist reforms. The PKK was founded during a time period when Anti-Kurdism was very widespread, and any and every indication of Kurdish identity was punishable by law. Communist and leftist Turks and Kurds remained tolerant of each other. Salafists and Pan-Islamists also remained tolerant of each other.\nKurds refused to include Turkish nationalism in their Islamic teachings, causing many Turks who wanted to pursue an unaltered Islamic education to travel to Kurdistan to begin studies. Islam had always been a unifier between Kurds and Turks, however even that became a subject of division as many Turks ditched mainstream Islamism in favor of the Turkish–Islamic synthesis, an Anti-Kurdish ideology which gave many impressionable Kurdish youth the idea that Islam was also their enemy. Islamist Turks and Kurds were formerly united against the Kemalists, although their relations worsened after Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who had an Islamist-nationalist ideology which was enough to satisfy most Islamist Turks, but made the Islamist Kurds dissatisfied, however, some Islamist Turks opposed Erdoğan and his treatment of Kurds, such as Alparslan Kuytul.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBehâ ed-Din (Baha' ad-Din Yusuf ibn Shaddad), The Life of Saladin, translated at London in 1897 by C.W.

He was entrusted to build a castle (hillfort) at the confluence of the Tisza and Zagyva rivers, where he already possessed lands, which area was the crossroads of several trade routes (including salt from Transylvania). The castle, and consequently the emerging county and the town of Szolnok preserved his name to the present day. Szolnok was murdered during the Vata pagan uprising in 1046.It is possible that his son was that Szolnok (II), was an advisor of Duke Géza in the early 1070s. He, along with Petrud and Bikács, betrayed his lord just before the Battle of Kemej in February 1074, where King Solomon's troops routed Géza's army. However, ultimately, Géza won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mogyoród in March 1074. His betrayal resulted that his offspring lost significant power and influence, which was never recovered.\n\n\n=== Possessions ===\nBy the middle of the 13th century, they possessed estates around Szolnok Castle, for instance, Szajol and Püspöki. According to historian György Györffy, they established the clan's monastery in Tenyő along the Tisza. A certain Gorgan from the kindred died without male descendants. Before his death, he bequeathed the estate Garábsáp near Nagyrév to the Dominican monastery of Pest. The Dominicans sold the estate to the Gyürki family in 1258, with the permission of Béla IV. It is possible that the Szentiványi, Tabajdi, Vanyarci, Szajoli, Mikebudai, Irsai, Nagyrévi, Vértesi, Sápi, Gyürki and Péteri families, which possessed portions in the surrounding lands, were all descended from the Szolnok clan.In addition to Szolnok County, members of the kindred acquired lands in other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. They possessed estates and portions in Pest County ((Mikebuda, Érkusbuda, Irsa, Alberti, Dánszentmiklós), Nógrád County (Bágyon), Fejér County (Szentpétervámája or Egyházasváma, Hidegkút) and Győr County (Gönyű). They established a coherent unit of their estates in the southern part of Nógrád County by the mid-13th century. Three families – 1, comes Pázmány and his brother Szolnok (I); 2, Tenyő and his cousins, Gotthard, Alexander and Pousa (I); 3, Paul (I), son of Gera – divided their village Bágyon among themselves in 1260. This data clearly shows that the genus had until now an extensive kinship, which led to the fragmentation of the lands and thus to the complete cessation of political influence.In 1264, Paul (I) sold three quarters of his portion to Pázmány in 1264. Peter (I), the son of Szolnok (I) was already a sick man and without male offspring around 1272. With the permission of Stephen V, he bequeathed his estates Szederkény in Baranya County and Zamara in Valkó County (near Aljmaš, Croatia) to the Dominican nunnery of Rabbits' Island in 1272. Peter died around 1280, and Ladislaus IV confirmed his donations in 1281. Leustach, son of comes Pázmány handed over the daughters' quarter (portions in Bágyon and Szabolcs) to his sister Elizabeth in 1276, with the consent of his kinship – Paul (II), Peter (I), Tenyő and his son Peter (II), Gotthard and his sons, and Pousa (II).The Bágyoni family descended from Gotthard, through two of his six sons. His daughter was Elizabeth, who was granted her daughters' quarter (portion in Bágyon) from her brothers, Andrew and Kemény, in 1283. Her husband Ivan, son of Csernete sold the estate to Paul Gutai, thus part of the village was no longer in the hands of the Szolnok kindred. Andrew and Dominic was still alive in 1309. They and their sons were forced to agree to the sale because they could not afford to litigate.\n\n\n== Family tree ==\nThe clan's Nógrád County (Bágyon) branch, based on János Karácsonyi and Pál Engel:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "content": "Tiden (\"The Time\") was a newspaper in Arendal, Norway that was historically aligned with the Labour Party.\nThe newspaper was privately established by Mikael Bie in 1906. It was taken over by the Labour Party in Nedenes Amt, later named Aust-Agder in 1908 and became the countywide newspaper covering news from a Labour standpoint. Later, the Labour Party also chose Tiden as the name of their publishing house.After Mikael Bie resigned as editor-in-chief in 1916, the newspaper was among others edited by politician Ola Solberg. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, the authorities clamped down on Tiden and stopped its publication in 1941. Tiden resumed on 15 May 1945.As the circulation reached 5,173 copies in 1961, it dropped below 3,000 by 1970 and stood at 2,726 in 1979 before being discontinued in 1982.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 5850 is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Virgo, about 115 million light-years from the Milky Way. Its speed relative to the cosmic microwave background is 2,735 ± 13 km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of 40.3 ± 2.8 Mpc (∼131 million ly). NGC 5850 was discovered by German-British astronomer William Herschel in 1786.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe luminosity class of NGC 5850 is II and it has a broad HI1 line. According to the SIMBAD database, NGC 5850 is a LINER galaxy, that is to say a galaxy whose nucleus presents an emission spectrum characterized by broad lines of weakly ionized atoms. To date, seven non-redshift measurements yield a distance of 18,700 ± 4.629 Mpc (∼61 million ly), which is far outside the Hubble distance values. Note that it is with the average value of independent measurements, when they exist, that the NASA/IPAC database calculates the diameter of a galaxy and that consequently the diameter of NGC 5850 could be approximately 58, 7 kpc (∼191,000 ly) if we used the Hubble distance to calculate it.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nNGC 5850 was used by Gérard de Vaucouleurs as a galaxy of morphological type SB(r)b in his galaxy atlas. Eskridge, Frogel and Pogge published a paper in 2002 describing the morphology of 205 closely spaced spiral galaxies. The observations were carried out in the H band of infrared and in the B band (blue). According to Eskridge and his colleagues, NGC 5850 is a spiral galaxy of type SB(r)ab in the B band and type SB(r)0/a in the H band. The isophotes of the outer bulb are almost circular. The nucleus appears elliptical. The bulb is crossed by a very long bar with ansae at its end. The bar is inclined at 60 degrees to the interior bulb. A complete inner ring is formed at the end of the bar and beyond there is a faint spiral structure. The spiral arms appear to form an incomplete outern pseudo-ring.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nOne supernova has been observed in NGC 5850, SN 1987B. It was discovered on 24 February 1987 lying 71\" west and 145\" south of the nucleus. The spectral analysis indicates that was a non-conventional type II supernova.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNGC 5846, thought to have caused creation of NGC 5850\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further bibliography ==\nAguerri, J.

        "content": "Laurynas Kasčiūnas (born 8 January 1982) is a Lithuanian right-wing politician, political analyst, Member of the Seimas for the Homeland Union and Minister of National Defence of Lithuania since 25 March 2024, replacing Arvydas Anušauskas.\n\n\n== Background ==\nKasčiūnas was born in the Lazdynai eldership in Vilnius in 1982 and graduated from the Ažuolynas Gymnasium in 2000. He studied political science in Vilnius University and graduated with a Doctor of Social Science degree in 2012. From 2007 to 2016, he also lectured in the political science faculty of the university.From 2012 to 2016, he was employed as a department manager in the Vilnius-based think tank East Europe Studies Centre. In 2016, he unsuccessfully ran for the Seimas in the southern Dzūkija (No. 69) constituency with the Homeland Union, but entered parliament via the party's list. He was reelected in 2020, and was appointed Minister of National Defence on 25 March 2024.Kasčiūnas is a member of the right-wing youth organization Young Christian Democrats and the Ronald Reagan Freedom Centre, an association founded in collaboration with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== National Democratic Party ===\nIn 1999, Kasčiūnas became the chairman of the Young National Democrats, the youth organization of the neo-nazi National Democratic Party of Lithuania, led by Mindaugas Murza, and joined the party itself a year later, in 2000. Alongside the party, Kasčiūnas participated in protests against Lithuania's accession to the European Union and was a member of the initiative group \"For Independent Lithuania\" which sought to campaign for the No vote in the 2003 Lithuanian European Union membership referendum. He also promoted anti-immigration rhetoric and claimed that same-sex marriage would lead to \"the extinction of nations\".In an interview with LRT, Kasčiūnas described the mood in Lithuania as \"europsychosis\". He later distanced himself from the party and described his membership in the LNDP as his \"path of searching\" during his teenage years.\n\n\n=== Homeland Union ===\nKasčiūnas was the advisor to Seimas member Irena Degutienė from 2009 to 2012 and joined the Homeland Union in 2011. His past membership in the LNDP caused concern, but an investigation by the Special Investigation Service did not deem him a threat to national security. He was elected to the Seimas on the TS-LKD list in the 2016 parliamentary election. In 2016, he was among the signatories of a request to ban LGBT pride rallies in Vilnius.In 2021, he called Remigijus Žemaitaitis a \"donkey\" on the parliament floor during a debate on a law on the status of foreign nationals.Kasčiūnas was delegated as the TS-LKD candidate for chairman of the Seimas National Security and Defence Committee in 2020. He served in the position until his appointment as Minister of National Defence. During his tenure, he had to tackle the Belarus-European Union border crisis and the Lithuanian response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Kasčiūnas is known for his hardline anti-immigration, anti-Belarusian and anti-Russian positions. He was one of the most active supporters of turn-back policy against illegal immigration and the construction of a border barrier on the Belarus-Lithuania border. He attempted to ban the ability for Russian and Belarusian citizens to obtain Lithuanian citizenship, but his proposal was withdrawn after opposition from the rest of the coalition.During the 2021 border crisis, he claimed:\n\nWe need to create some kind of cost system so that it doesn't pay to do it [immigrate to Lithuania]. Of course, according to international obligations, we cannot do what we fantasize about, but some restriction of freedom in the refugee center, so that they feel the costs, that they will have to sit closed for half a year and it will not be easy to go to Berlin, I think will be a good message to the people at home, the Syrian and Iraqi people that it is better not to go to Lithuania.\nAfter Anušauskas resigned as Minister of National Defence in March 2024, Kasčiūnas was appointed by Gitanas Nausėda on 25 March 2024 and sworn in on the next day. He announced that his main tasks in his position will be to implement the principle of universal defence, prepare to receive a permanently deployed Bundeswehr brigade, pursue conscription reform and national agreement on additional funds for defense, and develop drone production capabilities.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Criticism by human rights organizations ===\nKasčiūnas has been regularly criticized by human rights organizations for his hardline anti-immigration attitudes and discriminatory statements. In 2022, he was brought to the Ethics and Procedures Commission of the Seimas for his statement that \"in cultures from which immigrants come, the value of children is by no means high. And they use them as cover, they manipulate us with them and often use them to hit our sensitivities\", which was interpreted as stoking ethnic hatred. After he was proposed for the office of Minister of National Defence, 20 human rights organizations published an open letter to President Gitanas Nausėda, requesting him to not appoint Kasčiūnas. Members of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis and Tadas Vinokur reached out to the Social Democratic Party of Germany, inquiring whether the appointment of a \"far-right minister\" would not jeopardize Lithuania's relations with Germany and the plan to deploy a Bundeswehr brigade on Lithuanian territory. Kasčiūnas answered the criticism by claiming that he is \"not a communist activist and this, presumably, is what they don't like\" His party's coalition partner, the Freedom Party, expressed that they do not support Kasčiūnas.\n\n\n=== Support for far-right movements ===\nKasčiūnas is a supporter of Donald Trump and initiated the formation of a \"Friends of US President Donald J. Trump\" parliamentary group in the Seimas during his presidency.In 2018, Kasčiūnas invited Christian Wirth and Nicole Höchst, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, to Lithuania, but abandoned the attempt after criticism from members of his party and its chairman Gabrielius Landsbergis.Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kasčiūnas openly supported Viktor Orbán. In 2021, he visited Hungary with two other members of the Seimas (fellow member of TS-LKD's right wing Audronius Ažubalis, and Farmer-Green member Giedrius Surplys) and visited the Hungarian border barrier, which he lauded as an important example for Lithuania.\n\n\n=== Allegations of corruption ===\nKasčiūnas testified during the MG Baltic case, a high-profile corruption case during which four members of the Seimas were sentences for taking bribes from the business conglomerate MG Baltic. In 2015, Raimondas Kurlianskis, the vice president of the conglomerate, sought support in the Seimas for an amendment of the Consumer Credit Law, he approached Mantas Adomėnas and Eligijus Masiulis, the amendment was submitted by Šarūnas Gustainis. Kurlianskis approached Kasčiūnas for a meeting with Irena Degutienė. Non-governmental organizations which Kasčiūnas was a member of later received financial support from the conglomerate.\n\n\n== References ==",

The people raged, so they followed the ideals of the previous revolt in Palermo and the latter succeeded, gaining the independence of the Neapolitan Republic.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn the aftermath, the Republic did not last for too long. A year later, the Spanish managed to restore the older Kingdom of Naples.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Organic market in Ukraine is a segment of the economy aimed at the production, circulation and consumption of organic products. The organic market in Ukraine includes the cultivation, production and/or circulation of various agri-food products in accordance with the organic production standards established by Ukrainian and/or international legislation. This market is an important segment of the Ukrainian agriculture and consumer market, which contributes to the preservation of the environment, maintenance of soil, plant, animal and human health, and development of sustainable agriculture.\n\n\n== Domestic market for organic products ==\n\nIn Ukraine, as of 31 December 2022, the total area of agricultural land under organic production and in-conversion is 263,619 hectares (0.6% of the total area of agricultural land in Ukraine), including the area of organic agricultural land – 246,126 hectares, the area of agricultural land in-conversion – 17,493 hectares. The total number of operators is 462, including 380 agricultural producers.\nIn recent years, before 24 February 2022, the domestic market increased in sales and the range of organic products continued to expand.\nDue to Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, domestic sales of Ukrainian organic products decreased by 36% in volume (6,280 tons) and 48% in value (about US$17 million) in 2022 compared to 2021.\nThe range of Ukrainian organic products on the domestic market includes milk and dairy products, vegetables, fruits and mushrooms, cereals and groats, flour, seeds, snacks, eggs, meat products, juices, beverages, pastes, canned products, oils, condiments and spices, sugar and other products, including bakery products, varenyky (dumplings with different fillings), pelmeni (meat dumplings), honey, chocolate, and tea and coffee.\n\n\n== Export of Ukrainian organic products ==\nDuring 2022, despite the full-scale war Ukraine exported 245,600 metric tons of organic products in the amount of US$219 million to 36 countries around the world, which is almost the same as in 2021 (261,000 metric tonnes, US$222 million). 95% of organic products from Ukraine were exported to European countries. Most products were exported by rail and road. Export volumes by vessels decreased, in particular, air transportation for export from Ukraine became impossible.\nThe largest importing countries of Ukrainian organic products in 2022 were the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Lithuania, the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic. Ukrainian organic producers also exported to some countries in Asia and North America.\nThe most exported organic products from Ukraine included corn, soybeans, and wheat. Other exports included sunflower oil, sunflower cake, sunflower seeds, frozen blueberries, barley, rapeseed, millet, and other products.\nAccording to the European Commission's Report, in 2022, Ukraine ranked the 3rd out of 125 countries by volume of organic products imported to the EU. Thus, in 2022, the EU imported 2.73 million tonnes of organic agri-food products, including 219 thousand tonnes (8%) from Ukraine, which is 85% of total Ukrainian organic export. Thus, Ukraine had leading positions among the exporting countries to the EU, having exported 93 thousand tonnes (77.1%) of cereals (excluding wheat and rice) and 20 thousand tonnes (22%) of organic oilseeds (excluding soybeans).\n\n\n== Legislative regulation of the organic market in Ukraine ==\nAs of March 2024, organic production in Ukraine is regulated by the Law of Ukraine \"On Basic Principles and Requirements for Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products\", as well as relevant by-laws.\nRegarding the history of development and implementation of organic legislation in Ukraine, initially, on 21 April 2011, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the Law \"On Organic Production\". The document defined the legal, economic, social and organisational framework for organic agriculture, requirements for growing, producing, processing, certification, labelling, transporting, storing and selling organic products and raw materials. But this law was not implemented.\nIn 2014, the Law \"On the Production and Circulation of Organic Agricultural Products and Raw Materials\" was adopted. This was the main legislative act in the field of organic market regulation until 2018.\nAlready on 10 July 2018, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the Law of Ukraine “On Basic Principles and Requirements for Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products” No. 2496, and on 2 August 2019 it was enacted.\nIn May 2023, the National Accreditation Agency of Ukraine issued the first accreditation certificate to Organic Standard LLC. In June 2023, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy included Organic Standard LLC in the State Register of Certification Bodies in the Field of Organic Production and Circulation of Organic Products, which allowed it to start certifying organic production and/or circulation of organic products in accordance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.\nIn August 2023, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy launched the Register of Operators that Produce Organic Products in Compliance with the Legislation in Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products.\n\n\n== Labelling of organic products ==\n\nLabelling of products put into circulation and sold as organic products is carried out in accordance with the Law of Ukraine “On Basic Principles and Requirements for Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products”. A product may be labelled as an organic if it is produced following legal requirements in the field of organic production, circulation and labelling of organic products and contains at least 95% of organic ingredients of agricultural origin (by weight, excluding water and table salt) and no more than 5 per cent (by weight) of non-organic ingredients included in the List of substances (ingredients, components) authorised for use in organic production and permitted for use in food. Organic production of such a product shall be confirmed by a certificate.\nOrganic products put into circulation and sold shall be labelled with the state logo for organic products.\nThe state logo for organic products shall be placed exclusively on the products produced according to the Law of Ukraine “On Basic Principles and Requirements for Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products”, which is confirmed by a certificate that ensures that the production process and circulation of products comply with the legal requirements in the field of organic production, circulation and labelling of organic products.\nThe state logo is approved by Order No. 67 of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy from 22 February 2019, can be applied to any packaging, label (sticker), consumer packaging, back label, bottle collar, docket, cork, information sheet, documents, statement, and other packaging elements accompanying the organic products.  \nThe state logo for organic products is registered as a trademark and belongs to the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine.\nThe requirements for the correct use of the state logo for organic products and their labelling are described on the website of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine, as well as in the Guidelines for the use of the state logo for organic products.\nIn September 2023, during the conference “Organic Day in Ukraine” the first 50 Ukrainian organic producers who were certified according to the Ukrainian organic legislation in the field of organic production, circulation and labelling of organic products and can label their products with the state logo were awarded.

        "content": "Pedro Augusto Cunha Pinto (born October 24, 1956) is a Portuguese manager and politician. He served as vice-president of the Lisbon City Council, administrator of Lisboa Capital da Cultura, Metro de Lisboa, MARL, President of Lismarketing SGPS, and Administrator of Associação Parque Junqueira. He was also President of the Tourism Association of Lisbon (ATL) and Secretary-General of the Confederation of Regional Business Associations (CAER). He was the parliamentary coordinator of the PSD in the Eventual Commission for Monitoring the Measures of the Financial Assistance Program to Portugal. He was a Member of the European Parliament and a Member of the Portuguese Parliament. From 2015 to 2019, he was the president of the Board of Directors of the Assembly of the Republic.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in Maquela do Zombo, Angola, the son of João Baptista Pinto and Maria Alice Cunha Pinto. He completed his studies at the Salvador Correia High School in Luanda. After the revolution of 1974 and following the independence of Angola, he returned to Portugal in 1975, at the age of 18, to reside in Porto.\nWhile working as a student, he attended the ISCTE – University Institute of Lisbon, becoming involved in the academic struggles of 1976 against the dominant current of MES. During this period, he began to take an interest in political life.\nAs a member of the Youth and the Social Democratic Party, he was president of JSD, becoming one of the youngest deputies in the Portuguese parliament, which is why he is considered one of the most experienced deputies in office. In 1985, he joined the first group of Portuguese MEPs in the European Parliament until 1989. In 1997, he was the head of the PSD list for the Municipal Assembly of Matosinhos. In 2001, he directed the campaign of Pedro Santana Lopes for the Lisbon City Council, later joining the municipal executive. In 2004, he assumed the vice-presidency of the Lisbon City Council, associated with some of the most media-covered works of the mandate, such as the Marquês Tunnel, the relocation of the Feira do Relógio, and the Bela Vista Park. Still in the Lisbon City Council, he was responsible for negotiating with Roberto Medina to bring Rock in Rio to Lisbon.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Horvat 'Eqed (Hebrew: חורבת עקד; also known as Khirbet el-'Aqd in Arabic) is an archaeological site in central Israel, located midway between Jerusalem and Jaffa. The site, situated on a hill, contains the ruins of an ancient fortified town, spanning from the Hellenistic period through the Bar Kokhba revolt, after which the site was ultimately abandoned.\nThe site features significant remains, including robust fortifications constructed during the Hellenistic period, possibly by Seleucid general Bacchides. These defenses were subsequently strengthened during the Bar Kokhba revolt, suggesting the site's potential role as a major rebel stronghold during that period. Further discoveries from this revolt include hiding complexes and coins used by the Jewish rebel state. Notable among the findings are Jewish ritual baths, as well as remnants of weaponry such as armor scales, slingshots, ballistae and arrowheads.\nHorvat 'Eqed is believed to be the site of the Hellenistic and early Roman-period town of Emmaus, with the name later shifting to a newer, larger city situated on the slopes, 2 kilometers away from the original location.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHorvat 'Eqed is located approximately 2 km southeast of the ruins of Emmaus Nicopolis and 22 km northwest of Jerusalem, within today's Canada Ayalon Park. It is situated atop a steep hill 365 m high, providing vantage points over its surroundings, including the northern Ayalon Valley, the Shephelah, the hills of Benjamin and the Jerusalem Mountains. Its location, at the crossroads between Jerusalem and the coastal plain, coupled with nearby water sources, has made it a site of strategic significance in ancient times.\n\n\n== Surveys and excavations ==\nThe archaeological site was initially surveyed in 1873 by C. R. Conder and H. H. Kitchener from the Palestine Exploration Fund, who recorded the presence of \"[f]oundations of houses, traces of ruins, and caves\".\nFurther explorations were undertaken by the Mandatory Department of Antiquities, and the site was surveyed again in 1972 by the Israel Archaeological Survey.\nIn the mid-1970s, unauthorized digs at the site prompted salvage excavations led by E. Damati. These efforts concentrated on a hiding complex located in the western section of the site.\nFrom 1978 to 1980, and again in 1983, the site was excavated under the direction of M. Gichon and Mi. Fischer from Tel Aviv University. These excavations revealed a 30-meter section of a wall at the southwestern summit of the hill, constructed with roughly hewn stones and fillers. The wall's thickness was approximately 2.5 meters, and it was preserved up to 3 meters high. In 1980, the excavations focused on uncovering semi-circular towers flanking the southern gate of the site. These towers were based on natural rock and filler, and evidence suggested they were destroyed during the First Jewish–Roman War and reconstructed in the Bar Kokhba revolt.\nIn 2011, B. Har-Even and E. Aharonovich from the Staff Office of Archaeology conducted a survey as part of a comprehensive plan focusing on the development, preservation, and conservation of key archaeological sites within Canada Ayalon Park.\nIn 2012, further archaeological investigations were conducted at the site by H. Hizmi, M. Haber, and E. Aharonovich. The work during this period was concentrated on the southeastern section, revealing portions of the southern and eastern walls that featured six towers spanning approximately 170 meters in total. The primary goals of this excavation phase were to better understand the site's fortifications across different historical periods. Special discoveries from this excavation include stamped Rhodian handles and yh-ligatured stamp impressions dating back to the 2nd century BCE, numerous marble fragments in three different colors, hypocaust bricks from a bathhouse, and fragments of ornate kalal vessels.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Maccabean revolt ===\n\nGichon and Fischer propose that the site corresponds to the Hellenistic-period Emmaus, which, according to the Book of Maccabees and the historian Josephus, was one of several locations fortified by the Seleucid general Bacchides around 160 BCE. This fortification formed part of a broader campaign to suppress the Maccabean revolt by controlling critical passes leading to the Judaean Mountains and ultimately to Jerusalem.\nThis identification has also been accepted by archaeologists Hizmi, Haber, and Aharonovich, who note its proximity to the site of Emmaus known from Roman and Byzantine times. They add that impressive remains dating from the second century BCE were found exclusively at the former site and not at the latter, lending further support to this identification.\n\n\n=== Early Roman period ===\n\nFindings from the early Roman period imply that inhabitants at the site sought and relished a degree of comfort and luxury. However, it remains unknown whether these were local civilians who resettled the area, newcomers who established roots there, or Hasmonean soldiers who continued to occupy the fortress following the defeat of the Seleucids.\n\n\n=== Bar Kokhba revolt ===\nHorvat 'Eqed exhibits a well-documented presence of Jewish rebels during the Bar Kokhba revolt, as evidenced by hiding complexes as well as artifacts such as arrowheads, pottery, and coinage typical of the period. The Hellenistic-period fortifications were reinforced during the revolt.\nThe majority of arrowheads unearthed at the site are believed to originate from the period of the Bar Kokhba revolt.\nDrawing on evidence of hiding complexes and imposing fortifications, archaeologists Hizmi, Haber, and Aharonovich argue that the site was more than a mere refuge. They posit that it was a major stronghold during the revolt, possibly serving as a secure and strategic base from which attacks were launched and daily activities under siege were coordinated.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nThe site was ultimately abandoned after the revolt, and the name Emmaus was transferred to a newly established town situated on the slopes 2 kilometers northwest. This \"new\" Emmaus may trace its origins back to the 1st century BCE, as evidenced by archaeological findings from this period found at the site. This historical relevance is supported by Josephus, who refers to Emmaus as a metropolis—a designation unlikely to apply to 'Eqed. According to Josephus, around 4 BCE, Varus burned Emmaus in retaliation for an attack on Roman soldiers by Jewish rebels nearby. Additionally, in 68 CE, the Legio V Macedonia was stationed at Emmaus, where they constructed a fortified camp to oversee the main routes leading to Jerusalem and the coast.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEmmaus Nicopolis – the site of Emmaus during the later Roman and Byzantine periods\nHorvat Mazad – a nearby fortified site also connected with the Hasmoneans\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Provincial autonomy was a political system reform proposal put forward by politicians and local power military personnel during the period when the Beiyang government ruled in the early years of the Republic of China. This series of activities took place between 1920 and 1924, with a total of ten provinces participating at that time, further developing into the Provincial Constitution Movement (1920-1926). The provinces involved included: Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, which were directly involved in the struggle between the North and the South; Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Shaanxi, which were located in the middle of the North-South conflict; Yunnan and Guizhou in the southwest, less affected by the North; and Zhejiang, which, despite being controlled by the Anhui clique after the war, still had close ties with the South. All of these regions had varying degrees of \"autonomy\" and \"federated governance\" actions.",

        "content": "Natalie Hsu En Yi (Chinese: 許恩怡; born 2004) is a Hong Kong actress who made her debut as a child actor and gained recognition for her role in the 2024 drama film Fly Me to the Moon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHsu was born in 2004. She is the daughter of actress and occupational therapist Ann Bridgewater. She started learning classical dance, ballet, and modern dance at the age of three, completing examinations for all grades at the Royal Academy of Dance. She discovered her mother's profession as an actress only until she turned ten, and albeit joining the drama club at school, she initially had no intention of becoming an actress herself. Hsu pursued her education at Independent Schools Foundation Academy, where she took theatre studies in the International Baccalaureate curriculum and studied under a full academic scholarship.\nIn the summer of 2020, Hsu received a message from Kim Chou, an artist agent and a friend of her mother. Chou informed her that director Zhang Yibai was seeking a schoolgirl actress with a dancing background for his latest feature film project The Day We Lit Up the Sky. After winning the role, Hsu left school to join the production, as she had to polish her Mandarin skills and undergo rehearsals. In the film, she portrayed Wong, a schoolgirl with dreams of becoming a dancer. Her performance earned her the Best Newcomer award in the 4th Golden Crane Awards in the Chinese Japan International Festival the following year. Hsu also appeared in several music videos, including Leo Ku and Edan Lui's \"Floating Classroom\". In 2023, Hsu played the role of Ling, the daughter of Isabella Leung's character, in the action thriller film Bursting Point, directed by Dante Lam.\nIn 2024, Hsu took on the role of Lam Tsz Kuet, the younger version of Angela Yuen's character, in the film Fly Me to the Moon. The character is a Hunanese girl who migrates to Hong Kong and faces discrimination and family issues. Hsu is also slated to appear in lead roles in the upcoming psychological thriller film Peg O' My Heart, and the drama film My First of May.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNatalie Hsu at IMDb",

        "content": "Xanthosia stellata, commonly known as star xanthosia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae and is endemic to eastern Australia. It is an erect subshrub with trifoliate leaves with elliptic leaflets, and white flowers in a compound umbel with up to three flowers per ray.\n\n\n== Description ==\nXanthosia stellata is an erect or ascending subshrub that typically grows to a height of 20 cm (7.9 in) and has star-shaped hairs on its stems and leaves. Its leaves are trifoliate, the leaflets elliptic or wedge-shaped, 2–12 mm (0.079–0.472 in) long and 2–10 mm (0.079–0.394 in) wide on a petiole 2–10 mm (0.079–0.394 in) long. The flowers are arranged in a compound umbel with 1 to 3 rays on a peduncle up to 12 mm (0.47 in) and up to 3 flowers per ray. There are yellow, later reddish petal-like involucral bracts 4–6 mm (0.16–0.24 in) long at the base of the peduncles. The sepals are 1.3–1.5 mm (0.051–0.059 in) long and the petals are white, 1.1–1.3 mm (0.043–0.051 in) long. Flowering occurs in November and December.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nXanthosia stellata was first formally described in 2000 by J.M. Hart and Murray J. Henwood in Australian Systematic Botany, from specimens collected by Hart the Blue Mountains National Park in 1996. The specific epithet (stellata) means \"starry\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of xanthosia grows in forest in the Blue Mountains and Southern Highland of New South Wales, and in Queensland. It is only known from Raymond Creek Falls in the Snowy River National Park in Victoria, where it grows in open shrubland and is listed as \"critically endangered\" under the Victorian Government Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joaquim Lourenço \"Jack\" Rebello (né Rebelo; born 24 February 1967) is an Indian drummer who works on the Konkani stage. The son of musician and pioneer of khell tiatr, Mastor, he began his career around the same time as his younger brother Luis. A leading drummer of Goa, Rebello spent two decades initially playing for Goan cover bands in Delhi.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRebello was born as Joaquim Lourenço Rebelo on 24 February 1967, in Benaulim, Goa. His father, João Santana Rebelo, known professionally as Mastor, was a Goan Catholic musician proficient in performing on the trumpet and double bass, and his mother, Faustina Florina Rodrigues, was a homemaker from Orlim, Goa. Rebello's musical lineage extended further, with his two uncles, Luis Henrique and João Caetano, also being musicians referred to as \"mestris.\" His father's third sibling was employed at the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Bombay, rather than pursuing a career in music like the rest of the family. João Rebelo, Rebello's father, was engaged in agriculture and additionally facilitated the setup of tents and parking arrangements for attendees of drama performances. Furthermore, he was involved in musical performances with the band Luis and his Melodians.\nRebello's musical talent was passed down to him by his paternal uncle, Luis Henrique. His upbringing in Benaulim, a hub of musical talent and tiatr artists, influenced his musical journey. From a tender age of 9, he displayed an interest in music and actively participated in various musical extravaganzas. At the age of 14, while still in the ninth grade, Rebello commenced his drumming career by collaborating with his uncle, Luis. Although initially offered the opportunity to play drums professionally in a tiatr production by M. Boyer in 1982, Rebello chose to prioritize his studies for the S.S.C examination and declined the offer. Nevertheless, he continued to accompany his father and uncle to village performances, where his drumming skills were showcased. As Rebello's career advanced, he became a sought-after drummer for tiatrs, collaborating with directors like the Mendes Brothers and Bab Peter, among others.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRebello's musical journey commenced as a drummer under the tutelage of his uncle, Luis Henrique. His early experiences included performances with brass bands, village feasts, and village tiatrs. Luis Henrique was recognized for his mastery of the double bass as a member of the popular orchestra, Luis and his Melodians. In 1983, Rebello received an invitation to join Luis and his Melodians, marking a significant milestone in his career. For a duration of five years, he showcased his drumming skills alongside the orchestra. In 1986, Rebello's aspirations led him to venture to Delhi, where he embarked on a new chapter as a member of the popular band, Seby and the Wings, and remained associated with them until the year 1995. Rebello's musical trajectory saw a transformative period unfold when Seby and the Wings commenced their performances at Isfahan, the coffee shop situated within The Taj Palace, New Delhi. This professional engagement at the coffee shop not only provided a platform for Rebello to refine his craft but also played a pivotal role in shaping his future musical endeavors. Throughout the week, the band captivated audiences with their performances, reserving Mondays as their designated day off.\nOn Mondays, they catered to private functions hosted by influential business magnates, further establishing their reputation. Occasionally, affluent business owners would hire them on Sundays, securing special authorizations from the hotel to engage the band's services. Evidently, Seby and the Wings held considerable popularity during the 1980s. The band, led by the band leader Seby Fernandes as the lead vocalist, boasted a lineup consisting of Mario Sequeira on bass and Peter Alfonso on keyboards. Rebello, despite being a newcomer at the time, swiftly earned a prominent position within the ensemble, showcasing his instrumental prowess. Following a successful eight-year tenure with Seby and the Wings, Rebello sought new musical opportunities and transitioned to the Black Slades, another prominent Goan band captivating audiences in Delhi. Rebello's musical journey exhibited consistency as he continued to grace the Taj Palace coffee shop for two decades, leaving a mark with his drumming prowess and contributing to the band's success.\nUpon his return to Goa, Rebello established his own musical ensemble called Bliss, which remained operational for a span of five years before ceasing its activities. He also garnered recognition as a member of several popular Indian bands in Goa's music scene. In 2005, during his residency in Goa, Rebello joined the band India for two seasons, dedicating a year of his tenure to their musical endeavors while concurrently engaging in the tiatrs (traditional Konkani musical theatre) produced by his close associate, Comedian Agostinho. Rebello initially immersed himself in the tiatr milieu in 1983, collaborating with Menino de Bandar and contributing his drumming prowess to the productions of tiatrs such as Deudita (God Gives), the non-stop tiatr Succorina, and Indiechi Maim (Mother India). In 2008, Rebello embarked on a collaboration with Comedian Agostinho, participating in the theatrical productions of Sir, Police - Part I, Police -Part II, Advogad (Advocate), Godfather, and Public. It is worth highlighting that Rebello achieved a distinction by partaking in two tiatrs that successfully completed 200 consecutive shows: Menino de Bandar's Succorina and Comedian Agostinho's Police - Part I. He performed in all 400 shows of these productions, cementing his position as the sole drummer within the tiatr realm to be associated with both these double-centuries. Throughout his career, Rebello has contributed his drumming expertise to over 40 albums, collaborating with tiatrists such as Wilmix-Sharon, Lawry Travasso, Pascoal Rodrigues, Menino de Bandar, Hortencio Pereira, and Justin de Santacruz. Additionally, he has had the privilege of collaborating with music directors including Maestro Josinho, Joaquim D'Souza, Baltazar Fernandes, Agostinho D'Cruz, and Babush Fernandes.\nRebello's return to Goa was prompted by the death of his brother, Luis, in 2015. Since 2017, Rebello has been actively engaged in the music scene, lending his talents to Comedian Agostinho and the Indian Indie pop band known as Eka, based in Delhi. Eka specializes in Hindi pop music and is prominently recognized for their performances at various social gatherings, including weddings and parties in Hyderabad, Ludhiana, Sri Lanka, Dubai, Singapore, and other locations. Their musical repertoire has extended to a broad range of events, such as the four-day conference organized by The South Asia Doctors, which hosted a gathering of 1000 delegates in Singapore. Rebello's musical journey has encompassed collaborations beyond his involvement with Eka. He has had the privilege of sharing the stage with artists like Norman Cardozo during live shows featuring the Goan singer, Lorna Cordeiro. Furthermore, Rebello has made significant contributions to the Konkani music scene by providing instrumental support for various audio albums alongside musicians such as Maestro Josinho, Agnelo Dias, and Joaquim D'Souza.\nWithin the realm of tiatr, Rebello has established himself as a regular and versatile musician. He has lent his skills to several directors, including M. Boyer, who endearingly referred to him as \"Dotor\" (transl. Doctor), as well as C. Alvares, Bab Peter, H. Britton, and the Mendes Brothers. His musical abilities have garnered popularity, leading to several engagements and performances. Rebello's proficiency ranges from being a top-tier drummer in dance bands to actively participating in tiatr productions, even taking on the responsibility of managing the ticket counter at Margao's Ravindra Bhavan. During a critical juncture in his career, Rebello confronted a pivotal choice between the realms of popular entertainment and tiatr. Ultimately, he elected to prioritize his involvement in tiatr, recognizing that live performances have become the predominant avenue for musicians to generate income, given the increasing prevalence of drum machines replacing live drummers in studio recordings.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRebello hails from a large family, consisting of eight siblings. Among his brothers are Luis, Eduardo, Flavino, Antonio, Agnelo, and Pascoal, while his sister is named Jesuina. Within the realm of Konkani music, both Luis and Agnelo have gained recognition as musicians. As of 2018, Rebello has established his residence in the Pequeno, Pulvaddo ward in Benaulim, Goa. He remains unmarried as of 2020. On 10 May 2015, Rebello's brother Luis, died at the age of 44, due to cardiac arrest in Raia, Goa. An affiliation exists between Rebello and Comedian Agostinho, a tiatrist, as they have collaborated in more than 200 performances. During his formative years, Rebello found inspiration in Rocky Gomes from Navelim, then-a leading drummer in Goa.\nRebello has expressed his views on singers who critique musicians openly. He admires Lawry Travasso for his skill in smoothly masking errors during performances. Rebello believes that victors of singing contests should engage in the Konkani music community, helping to enrich the \"kantaram\" performances crucial to the tiatr heritage. Rebello has raised concerns regarding the lack of recognition and respect accorded to musicians in tiatr productions, despite their extended performances lasting three hours in tight spaces. Beyond his musical interests, Rebello also demonstrates a passion for football.\n\n\n== References ==",

Josef Dehottay, were deported to Germany and stripped of their Belgian nationality in 1935. As a result, this party did not field any candidates in the 1936 legislative elections and called on people to join the Heimattreue Front, which advocated a blank vote. The Heimattreue Front won an absolute majority, while the Catholic Party won 53% of the votes cast, the POB 12.7% and the Rexists 26.4%. \nIn the next elections, in 1939, the Catholic Party obtained 38.6%, the POB 4% and the Liberal Party 3.4%, while the Heimattreue Front obtained 45.1% of the vote, which was not as absolute a success as in other German-speaking regions bordering Germany, such as the Sudetenland, Free City of Danzig and Memel Territory.\nResults of the 1939 parliamentary elections\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "content": "Beatrice ap Rice (died 1561) was a servant of Mary I of England. She was first recorded as a laundress in 1519.Her name was sometimes written as Beatrix a Pryce, or Beatrice Aprice. The household accounts of Lady Mary call her the \"launder\". She and Jane Foole were ill in 1543 while the household was at Beddington, and at Greenwich Palace.Mary and Philip II of Spain granted her lands at Boreham in the honour of Beaulieu alias Newhall, citing her forty years in royal service.Beatrice died in December 1561, after making a will on 25 May, and was buried at Boreham in Essex. The parish register recorded her burial in January, \"Betteris Apryse landeris to Queen Marie\".\n\n\n== Family ==\nHer husband was David ap Rice, a yeoman of the chamber. He died before November 1557. Their children included Harry, Susan, Winifred, and probably Mary. The accounts of Lady Mary include gifts to the children.It is not known if she was a relation to Mrs Barbara Ryce, Mary's chamberer, and her husband William Ryce (died 1588), who was also a royal servant.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Louis Forton (born March 14, 1879, in Sées, Orne; died February 15, 1934, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye) was a French screenwriter and comic strip artist.\nLouis Forton was one of the pioneers of French comic strips. He is notably the creator of the famous satirical and humorous series: Les Pieds nickelés, created in 1908, and Bibi Fricotin, in 1928, continued after his death by Gaston Callaud.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLouis Alphonse Forton was born in Sées in the department of Orne on March 14, 1879. Before becoming a cartoonist, Louis Forton worked as a stable boy, then a groom, and finally a jockey. After meeting one of the Offenstadt Brothers in 1904, who began publishing illustrated magazines for youth, he was hired as an artist for the weekly magazine L'Illustré. He began his artistic career with the publication of L’Histoire du Sire de Ciremolle. Shortly after the demise of this magazine, he regularly contributed to Petit Illustré amusant, military journals such as La Vie en culotte rouge, La Vie de Garnison, as well as to Polichinelle and Petit Illustré Amusant.\nFor the launch of L’American illustré in 1907, he drew numerous stories such as Isidore Mac Aron, Anatole Fricotard, and Séraphin Laricot, under anglophone pseudonyms such as \"Tom Hatt\", \"Tommy Jackson\", or \"W. Paddock\". In 1908, he became the main artist for l'Épatant for which he created Les Pieds nickelés in the ninth issue dated June 4, 1908. He illustrated 1948 strips for this series. At the same time, he continued to draw for magazines such as La Vie de Garnison, as well as Mon Copain du Dimanche (1911) and Le Pêle-Mêle (1924). In 1924, he stopped Les Pieds Nickelés to create Bibi Fricotin in Le Petit Illustré. In 1925, he created Les Aventures de Ploum for l'Épatant. In 1927, he resumed the adventures of Les Pieds Nickelés which he continued until his death on February 15, 1934, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye following a surgical operation.\nHis son ran the bar des Mûriers (\"Aux Pieds Nickelés\"), Avenue Gambetta, in Paris, and his grandson Gérald Forton became a cartoonist like him.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nLa vocation de Bibi Fricotin (1928).\nBibi Fricotin fait des farces (1928).\nBibi Fricotin fait le tour du monde (1930).\nBibi Fricotin boit l'obstacle (1931).\nBibi triomphe (1933).\nBibi Fricotin détective (1934).\nBibi Fricotin roi des débrouillards (1935).\nLa Bande des Pieds Nickelés.\nLes Pieds Nickelés arrivent.\nLes Pieds Nickelés au Far West.\nLes Pieds Nickelés au Mexique.\nLes Pieds Nickelés en Amérique.\nLes Pieds Nickelés ministres.\nLes Pieds Nickelés s'en vont en guerre.\nLes Pieds Nickelés voyagent.\nLes nouvelles aventures des Pieds Nickelés.

        "content": "Paul Christiaan Struik is a Dutch agronomist, academic and author. He is an Honorary Professor of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Adjunct Faculty staff member of the University of Bangalore, as well as an emeritus Professor in Crop Physiology at Wageningen University.\nStruik's research primarily focuses on agrobiodiversity, potato physiology, seed systems science, integration of social and natural sciences, and modeling of photosynthesis. He has authored and co-authored more than 650 journal articles and edited or wrote more than 15 books including Seed Potato Technology, Plant Production on the Threshold of a New Century, Crop Systems Biology: Narrowing the Gaps between Crop Modelling and Genetics and Crop Science: Progress and Prospects. He is the recipient of awards, such as the 2019 International Crop Science Award from the Crop Science Society of America, the 2022 World Potato Congress Industry Award, and he was appointed Officer in the Order of Orange-Nassau by King Willem-Alexander in 2022.\nStruik is a Fellow of the Association of Applied Biologists and the Editor-in-Chief of Potato Research.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\nStruik earned an MSc in 1978 and a PhD in 1983, both from Wageningen Agricultural University, on research on the agronomic aspects of digestibility of forage maize. He worked as a Scientific Assistant from 1978 to 1981 and Research Agronomist from 1982 to 1986 at the same university.\n\n\n== Career ==\nStruik continued his academic career as a professor in Field Crops' Science at Wageningen Agricultural University from 1986 to 1995. He became Professor in Crop and Grassland Science at Wageningen University from 1995 to 1998, and later Professor in Crop Physiology from 1998 to 2023, since when he has been serving as emeritus Professor.\nIn 2019, Struik founded Stichting Corona to research the ethical implications of technological interventions in crops, farm animals, and ecosystems, including soil, and disseminate findings to society. He held positions on committees at ICARDA, including Vice Chair of the board of trustees in 2021, and organized international congresses, while also being involved in the European Association of Potato Research, initially as Secretary and Treasurer, and later as a Council Member. Furthermore, he has made media appearances through television and radio interviews for programmes such as the RTL4 late-night talk show Barend & Van Dorp, AVRO/TROS EenVandaag, TROS Nieuwsuur and OBA Live (Radio 5).\n\n\n== Research ==\nStruik has contributed to the field of agronomy by studying crop physiology, plant breeding and various socioeconomic dimensions of agriculture, including food security, governance and ethics. In the 1980s and 1990s he collaborated with farmer activists and politicians, such as Cees Veerman, Dick de Zeeuw and Sicco Mansholt, to create change in the Dutch agricultural systems.\n\n\n== Works ==\nStruik has published books on crop science and plant production. He co-edited Plant Production on the Threshold of a New Century, discussing challenges and advancements across plant production sectors, aiming for sustainability by aligning policy, economics, environment, and crop science with farming practices and systems. With Xinyou Yin, he focused on bridging the gap between genomics and crop physiology through research in Crop Systems Biology: Narrowing the Gaps between Crop Modelling and Genetics, aiming to improve crop productivity under changing environmental conditions. Additionally, in Crop Science: Progress and Prospects, he compiled keynote papers from the Third International Crop Science Congress, offering an overview of challenges and prospects in the field. Thomas A. Lumpkin commented, \"While this publication was designed by the editors to serve as a 'textbook for advanced professionals', many of its chapters will be of interest to all parties involved in this issue.\"\nStruik's 2023 book Impact of Hybrid Potato: The Future of Hybrid Potato from a Systems Perspective discussed the potential of hybrid breeding technology in potatoes to address challenges related to poverty, food security, and climate change, particularly in remote and harsh environments. He also authored Seed Potato Technology, looking into global seed potato production, including propagation, quality assessment, multiplication techniques, and diverse seed supply systems. In a review for Experimental Agriculture, D.K.L. MacKerron remarked, \"...the authors have presented us with a very wide-ranging overview of potato production and have done an excellent job of relating the underlying science of the potato plant to the practicalities of producing seed potatoes... This book is required reading for anyone wanting a well-written and readable account of potato production – seed or ware.\"\n\n\n=== Crop physiology ===\nStruik researched crop physiology throughout his career. During the final decades, he was active in the field of modelling photosynthesis at different levels of biological organization. He analyzed complex processes of leaf-level photosynthesis, emphasizing the balance between photon-induced electron transport, Rubisco-mediated carbon fixation, and triose phosphate utilization, highlighting key physiological mechanisms in plant and crop growth. Moreover, he assessed the interdependence between micro-scale and whole-plant sink limitations by manipulating sink-source ratios in rice plants and studying gas-exchange data across different leaf treatments and nitrogen levels.\n\n\n=== Seed systems ===\nStruik studied seed systems by analyzing their breeding and genetic diversity. He explored the perspectives of commercial plant breeders on hybrid breeding systems, highlighting their effectiveness in crop improvement but noting challenges, such as high production costs, in their commercial application. His research highlighted the importance of seed degeneration for various crops, including cassava and sweet potato, underlining the potential benefits of techniques like positive selection, particularly in understanding the factors influencing viral load in plants. In addition, he investigated epidemics like purple top disease in Ecuador and bacterial wilt in Ethiopia, emphasizing the importance of coordinated responses and collective action to address such public health threats effectively, which endanger the potato crop.\nAlongside colleagues, Struik investigated potato seed degeneration in the Andes, finding that farmers' varieties are resistant to degeneration and on-farm practices play a key role, suggesting partial seed replacement as a viable strategy. He also examined the impact of agroecological settings and seed recycling on potato seed degeneration in low-income countries, revealing heterogeneous effects across different altitudes and propagation cycles, highlighting the complexity of seed degeneration processes.\n\n\n=== Food security and biodiversity conservation ===\nStruik's work on food security and conservation focused on their global influencing factors. In a collaborative paper that was conferred the 2017 Elsevier-Atlas Award, he showed how empowering rural women through participatory barley breeding programs can improve seed governance and, consequently, household food security in dry temperate regions. In another joint study,  global changes in crop contributions to national food supplies were demonstrated, indicating increased reliance on a few globally distributed crops and greater interdependence among nations in food supplies and genetic resources. This paper received an International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) Original Research Publication Award in 2014.\nStruik contributed to a study that presented an inventory of crop wild relatives in the United States, prioritizing 821 taxa for conservation efforts and highlighting the necessity for partnerships and prompt action.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2017 – Medal for supervising 100 PhD studies, Wageningen University\n2019 – International Crop Science Award, Crop Science Society of America\n2022 – World Potato Congress Industry Award\n2022 – Officer in the Order of Orange-Nassau, King Willem-Alexander\n2024 – Fellow, Association of Applied Biologists\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nPlant Production on the Threshold of a New Century (1994) ISBN 978-0792329039\nSeed Potato Technology (1999) ISBN 978-9074134651\nCrop Science: Progress and Prospects (2001) ISBN 978-0851995304\nCrop Systems Biology: Narrowing the Gaps between Crop Modelling and Genetics (2016) ISBN 978-3319205618\nImpact of Hybrid Potato: The Future of Hybrid Potato from a Systems Perspective (2023) ISBN 978-9086863921\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nEwing, E.

        "content": "L'Épatant was a former magazine of humorous comics created on April 9, 1908 by the Offenstadt Publications, a publishing house run by the Offenstadt Brothers, which ran until August 24, 1939. L'Épatant was a weekly magazine published every Thursday.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first issue was a free supplement to the Petit Journal, consisting of sixteen pages. In the early years, the magazine cost five centimes; its price began to increase regularly from August 9, 1917, reaching thirty centimes in 1920, a price it maintained until 1936. The magazine contained news, serialized novels, and illustrated stories, the latter being presented in the form of drawings accompanied by text (narration or dialogue) placed below.\nIt was in issue 9 of L'Épatant (June 4, 1908) that Louis Forton first published his famous comic series Les Pieds Nickelés.\nDuring World War I, the magazine strongly emphasized patriotism and the valorization of French fighters, particularly through the antics of the Pieds Nickelés.\nIn his autobiographical work Les Mots, Jean-Paul Sartre mentions his attraction to the magazine: \"I invented a difficult and deadly universe – that of Cri-Cri, of L'Épatant, of Paul d'Ivoi\".\nIn the 1960s, the Société parisienne d'édition was absorbed by Publications Georges Ventillard.\nSeveral attempts to revive the title were made. The first lasted from April 19 to November 22, 1951, with 32 weekly issues of 8 pages featuring series such as Les Pieds Nickelés (drawn by Pellos), Bibi Fricotin (by Pierre Lacroix), and Les Aventures préhistoriques de Tétar-Zan (by Mat and Lortac). A second relaunch was attempted from March 2 to November 2, 1967 (36 weekly issues of 28 pages), and a third from December 1967 to June 1969 (twelve monthly issues then bimonthly in pocket format). However, these new formats failed to compete with the strong competition from weeklies offering higher-quality comics, such as Spirou and Tintin, joined from 1959 by Pilote.\nIn 1981, the magazine Marius, also owned by the Ventillard group, changed its title to L'Épatant Marius for eight issues before being absorbed by Le Hérisson, which ceased publication in 1994.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nJean-Louis Touchant, La Fabuleuse Histoire de L'Épatant, dossier paru dans le magazine le Rocambole n° 52-53 Les illustrés pour la jeunesse, 2010\n\n\n== External links ==\nPresentation of l'Épatant magazine on the BD Nostalgie website.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ernest Longstaffe (5 April 1884 – 23 November 1958) was an English composer, conductor, and radio producer.\nHe was born in Newport, Essex, the son of the landscape painter Edgar Longstaffe.  He started his career in concert parties and summer variety shows. He wrote many tunes for the big band, including \"When the Sergeant-Major's on Parade\", first published in 1925, for which he wrote both words and music.  He also wrote a musical comedy, His Girl, and the revue Up With the Lark.    \nErnest Longstaffe made his first radio broadcasts in 1926, as composer and presenter of a variety programme, The Bee Bee Cabaret.  He became a leading producer of music and variety programmes in the early days of the BBC, and also operated as the programmes' composer and conductor, often of the BBC Dance Orchestra.   The BBC radio programmes that he produced included Palace of Varieties  –  reportedly the favourite radio programme of King George VI  –  and The Happidrome.  Although none of his programmes were televised, Longstaffe insisted that all his radio performers wore stage costume when performing. \nHe retired from the BBC in 1949, but continued to appear on Palace of Varieties until shortly before his death, in hospital in London in 1958 at the age of 74.\n\n\n== References ==",

Kuo (Chinese: 郭智輝; born 7 February 1953) is a Taiwanese business executive and politician who was appointed the Minister of Economic Affairs in 2024.\nKuo was born in Pingtung County. In his first sales job after completing military service, Kuo learned Japanese in two years, and later worked for Terry Gou as an interpreter and driver. Kuo has served as chairman of TeaLa, and cofounded Topco Scientific Company. \nOn 16 April 2024, Kuo was appointed Minister of Economic Affairs in Cho Jung-tai's incoming cabinet, succeeding Wang Mei-hua in the role. Members of the Kuomintang panned the selection of Kuo as economic minister, drawing attention to violations of the Securities and Exchange Act by Kuo and Topco in 2005, and Kuo's investments in China, an issue that had affected Terry Gou's 2020 and 2024 presidential campaigns.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was Formed in 1891 through the merger of the towns of Whatcom and Sehome.\n\n\n== History ==\nNew Whatcom played a significant role in the early development of the region. The town's creation was assisted by the arrival of a large number of settlers from Kansas, drawn by the promise of new opportunities in the Pacific Northwest.\nThe name \"Whatcom\" is derived from a Native American word meaning \"noisy rumbling water,\" a reference to the Whatcom Falls located nearby. This natural resource and landmark in itself, along with the area's stunning natural beauty, helped attract early settlers to the region.\nNew Whatcom thrived as a bustling town, benefiting from its strategic location on the bay and its proximity to the growing industries of the time, including logging, fishing, and shipping. The town's economy boomed, and its population grew rapidly as more people arrived seeking a better life in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn 1903, New Whatcom merged with the neighboring town of Fairhaven to form the city of Bellingham. This merger was driven by a desire to streamline local governance and to better capitalize on the economic opportunities presented by the two towns' combined resources.\nToday, the legacy of New Whatcom lives on in the City of Bellingham, which continues to be a vibrant community known for its stunning natural surroundings, outdoor recreation opportunities with its Lakes and Mountains, and rich combined-history. The merger of New Whatcom and Fairhaven marked a significant moment in the region's history, shaping the development of Bellingham into the thriving city it is today.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBellingham, Washington\nFairhaven, Bellingham, Washington\nWhatcom County, Washington\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sohan Lal Suri (d. 1852) was the son of Lala Ganpat Rai, the waqai navis or court chronicler. Sohan Lal inherited the position from his father and served at the court of Lahore till after the death of Ranjit Singh in 1839. The period covered by him as a court chronicler begins in 1812 and includes the Anglo-Sikh War. Lala Ganpat Rai had served as a Munshi for three generations of the Sukerchakia Misl. He gained employment under Sardar Charat Singh in 1771 and on his death, served under Maha Singh and then in Ranjit Singh's court till 1811–12.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Suris belonged to the Khukhrain ‘biradari’ (clan) from the Pothwar region of Punjab, now in Pakistan. The family was said to be descended from Raja Khokhar Anand, a 12th-century ruler of Lahore.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSohan Lal penned events at the Lahore Durbar in Persian, contiguous with the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The work, in five daftars or volumes, was translated into English in the twentieth century by Vidya Sagar Suri, his descendant.: General Preface \nDaftar 1 History of the Sikhs from the birth of Guru Nanak in 1469 to 1771.\nDaftar 2 Charts the career of Charhat Singh and the rise of Ranjit Singh and covers the period from 1772 to 1830.\nDaftar 3 Is divided into five parts and covers the events in the court of Lahore from 1831 to 1839, the year Ranjit Singh died.\nDaftar 4 Is divided into three parts and covers significant events in the Sikh Court from 1839 to 1845. A part of the narrative from this period is missing. After the First Anglo-Sikh War, Sohan Lal Suri gave the account of the wars from 29 September 1845 to 20 September 1846 between the ‘Singhs’ and the ‘glorious Sahibs’ to Herbert Benjamin Edwardes who served at the Punjab Frontier to peruse. Edwardes did not return the records. As there was no copy, this period is missing from the Umdat-ut-tawarikh, the Lahore court chronicle.: vol IV part 3 373—translator's note \nDaftar 5 This volume deals with the period commencing in 1845 till 1849, the year the Sikh Empire was annexed by the East India Company.\nClaude Martin Wade was appointed the political agent by the East India Company and was ordered to report the proceedings of Maharaja Ranjit Singh's court. In speaking of the indigenous work, he said—\n\"Allowing for the partiality of the writer’s views and opinions, as regards the fame and credit of his patron, yet, as a record of dates and a chronicle of events, tested by a minute comparison with other authorities, and my own personal investigations into its accuracy during a residence of seventeen years among the Sikhs, I am enabled to pronounce it, in those two respects, as a true and faithful narrative of Runjeet Singh’s eventful life.\"\nAccording to Bayly, a twenty-first-century specialist in global and Indian history, Sohan Lal Suri's Umdat-ut-Tawarikh gives ‘a good impression of the density of information coming in to Ranjit Singh…’.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gwendolyne Daphne Stevens born Gwendolyne Daphne Healey (7 June 1908 – 3 March 1974) was an Australian hospital proprietor, sheep breeder and mining entrepreneur. She established several successful businesses culminating in the discovery that led to the creation of the Nabarlek Uranium Mine in the Northern Territory.\n\n\n== Life ==\nStevens was born in the town of Quorn in Australia in 1908. Her parents were also both born in South Australia. Her mother was Jessie Gwendolyne (born Napier) and her father was Hugo Albert Valentine Healey. She was educated at St Peter's Girls' School and she first trained as a nurse at the Adelaide Hospital qualifying in 1929 and as a psychiatric nurse at Parkside Mental Hospital in 1931 and she soon becoming sister-in-charge.In 1934 she opened a private psychiatric hospital in Darrach House. The large house had been built for James Waddell Marshall who ran the department store. She ran this hospital for eighteen years. In 1940 she married George Dempster Stevens and they had two children. She sold her hospital in 1952 and bought a farm.Her farm was a stud for sheep and it was called Sterling Downs. She took an interest each week, but a manager saw to its day to day running. She moved the stud to Sterling Park and that is where she discovered that the land was a source of sand. She made money selling the sand to the local council.With her new interest in mining she investigated the potential around Oenpelli (now Gunbalanya) in the Northern Territory. She had the rights to over 1250 sq. miles and she named the area \"nabarlek\" after the local nocturnal little rock-wallaby. She partnered with Queensland Mines Ltd in the venture. Uranium was discovered in 1970 and in 1973 she sold out in return for a royalty from the Nabarlek Uranium Mine. She had intended to share the wealth with the aboriginal people who had lived on the land, but she died in 1974 in the Adelaide suburb of Kensington Park from a brain haemorrhage.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "Nikola Kirilov Kasabov also known as Nikola Kirilov Kassabov (Bulgarian: Никола Кирилов Касабов) is a Bulgarian and New Zealand computer scientist, academic and author. He is a professor emeritus of Knowledge Engineering at Auckland University of Technology, Founding Director of the Knowledge Engineering and Discovery Research Institute (KEDRI), George Moore Chair of Data Analytics at Ulster University, as well as visiting professor at both the Institute for Information and Communication Technologies (IICT) at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Dalian University in China.\nKasabov's research is primarily focused on computational intelligence, neuro-computing, bioinformatics, neuroinformatics, speech and image processing, data mining, knowledge representation and knowledge discovery. He has published research articles and books such as Foundations of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Knowledge Engineering and Evolving Connectionist Systems: The Knowledge Engineering Approach. He is the recipient of multiple best paper awards along with the Asia Pacific Neural Network Assembly (APNNA) Excellent Service Award (2005), the Bayer Science Innovator Award (2007), the International Neural Network Society (INNS) Gabor Award (2012), the APNNA Outstanding Achievements Award (2012), the INNS Ada Lovelace Meritorious Service Award (2018), and the Research.com Computer Science in New Zealand Leader Award (2022 and 2023).\nKasabov is a Life Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand, the INNS College of Fellows, the Asia-Pacific Artificial Intelligence Association (AAIA), as well as the Institute of IT Professionals. He is the co-founder and Co-Editor-in-Chief of Evolving Systems.\n\n\n== Education ==\nKasabov earned an MSc in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Computer Science in 1971, receiving his PostGrad Diploma in Applied Math in 1972 and a PhD in Mathematical Sciences in 1975, all from the Technical University, Sofia. In 2018, he was awarded a Doctor Honoris Causa from Obuda University, Budapest.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKasabov began his academic career at the Technical University, Sofia, initially as a Research Fellow in the Department of Computer Science, later becoming a lecturer in 1978 and associate professor in 1988. In 1989, he joined the University of Essex Department of Computer Science as a Research Fellow and Senior Lecturer. Subsequently, he assumed the role of Senior Lecturer at the University of Otago Department of Information Science, where he was appointed Professor and Personal Chair from 1999 to 2002. He has been serving as a professor of Knowledge Engineering at Auckland University of Technology since 2002, as well as visiting professor at both the Institute for Information and Communication Technologies (IICT) at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Dalian University in China since 2022.\nIn 2001, Kasabov founded Knowledge Engineering Consulting. He was President of the APNNA in 2007–2008 and of the INNS in 2009 and 2010, concurrently serving as Vice President of the INNS in 2006, President-Elect in 2008 and as a Governor Board Member from 2011 to 2017. In 2019, he assumed the presidency of the APNNA and has been a Founding Member of the Governing Board since 1993.\n\n\n== Research ==\nKasabov has contributed to the field of computer science by conducting research on evolving connectionist systems (ECOS) and the spiking neural network architecture NeuCube.\n\n\n== Works ==\nKasabov has published books on knowledge engineering and neural networks. His seminal work Foundations of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Knowledge Engineering integrated neural networks, fuzzy systems, and symbolic AI for AI solutions in various fields, which led to the development of the ECOS theoretical framework. He further discussed its potential applications in the monograph, Evolving Connectionist Systems: The Knowledge Engineering Approach, such as the discovery of diagnostic markers for early detection of cancer. Later on, in 2019, he authored Time-Space, Spiking Neural Networks and Brain-Inspired Artificial Intelligence, exploring spiking neural networks (SNN), looking into classical theory, while also introducing brain-inspired AI (BI-AI) systems and their applications across various domains.\n\n\n=== Evolving connectionist systems ===\nKasabov has researched ECOS throughout his career. He implemented the ECOS framework by introducing the Dynamic Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (DENFIS), an online learning neuro-fuzzy method and the Evolving Fuzzy Neural Network (EFuNN), a model for online supervised/unsupervised learning and fuzzy rule extraction, both utilized in the software development environment NeuCom, earning him several patents.\n\n\n=== Spiking neural networks ===\nKasabov's work on spiking neural networks (SNN) led to the development of new methodologies like the NeuCube theoretical framework for brain-inspired computation. He extended ECOS principles to comprehend spatio-temporal brain data via spike representation, featuring a 3D SNN structure trained with brain-inspired rules, facilitating interpretable connectivity models and offering fast, low-power processing ideal for real-time applications like human prosthetic control. He also presented deSNN, a dynamic evolving spiking neural network (SNN) method, for incremental learning of spatio-temporal streaming data, utilized in the NeuCube system, and employed the NeuCube brain-inspired SNN architecture for moving object recognition, utilizing dynamic vision sensors (DVS) to convert object data into spikes and achieving superior accuracy on benchmark data. Furthermore, alongside colleagues, he introduced SPAN (Spike Pattern Association Neurons) algorithms to train spiking neurons for precise spike sequence generation in response to specific input patterns.\nIn a paper that received the 2016 Neural Networks Best Paper Award, Kasabov proposed novel algorithms for deep learning of spatio-temporal data. He devised a personalized modeling method using SNN, which was later patented, integrating static and dynamic data, demonstrated in air pollution and drug addiction treatment prediction, outperforming other machine learning methods with a 94% accuracy. Additionally, he developed personalized modeling methods with brain-inspired SNN, achieving accurate prediction in EEG data and high predictive accuracy for dementia and AD onset using MRI longitudinal data, as well as proposed an original method for fMRI data learning and visualization with brain-inspired SNN.\nWith Simei Gomes Wysoski  and Lubica Benuskova, Kasabov developed an SNN method integrating audio and visual data, surpassing other methods in decision-making tasks. He presented a quantum interpretation of spikes and a probabilistic spiking neuron model, alongside a quantum-inspired evolutionary optimization method for SNN, enabling faster convergence of solutions. His team also pioneered SNN models for understanding brain processes through ERP data, predicting treatment responses in schizophrenic patients, and learning EEG data for building brain-computer interfaces, by introducing SNN integration of time, space, and orientation data with oiSTDP.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2005 – Excellent Service Award, APNNA\n2007 – Bayer Science Innovator Award\n2012 – Outstanding Achievements Award, APNNA\n2012 – Dennis Gabor Award, INNS\n2017 – Ada Lovelace Meritorious Service Award\n2022 – Life Fellow, IEEE\n2022, 2023 – Computer Science in New Zealand Leader Award, Research.com\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Selected books ===\nFoundations of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems, and Knowledge Engineering (1996) ISBN 978-0262112123\nEvolving Connectionist Systems: The Knowledge Engineering Approach (2007) ISBN 978-1846283451\nComputational Neuro-genetic Modelling (2007) ISBN 978-0387483535\nArtificial Neural Networks Methods and Applications in Bio-/Neuroinformatics (2015) ISBN 978-3319349503\nTime-Space, Spiking Neural Networks and Brain-Inspired Artificial Intelligence (2019) ISBN 978-3662577134\n\n\n=== Selected articles ===\nKim, J., & Kasabov, N.

        "content": "Rune inscription U 1132, or the Gimo stone, is a rune stone in Gimo, Skäfthammar parish and Östhammar municipality in Uppland. The rune stone now stands at Gimo damm about two kilometers northwest of Skäfthammar's church.\n\n\n== The Stone ==\nDuring a survey by Johannes Bureus in CE.1594, the stone was found by a bridge over Gimån, the stream between Gimo damm and Olandsån and about 500 meters north of Skäfthammar's church. In the CE.19th century, the stone was placed in Gimo's cemetery gate, but was later moved to its current location at Gimo Damm.The size of the stone is 2.4 m in height and 0.8 m in width at the base, as well as 1.5 m wide at the top, 0.35 m thick at the northwestern edge and 0.15 m thick at the southern edge. The material is gray, coarse-grained granite. The carver is Ömund.\n\n\n== The inscription ==\n\nThe stone is erected after the parents by their three sons. The name Liutr is unusual and is further found only on U 1016. Þrotti is coated on runestones Sö 115, Sö 200, U 17 and U 485. oþuiþr probably renders a male name Auðviðr; the diphthong Au is single-signed in both names oþuiþr' and oþmontr - Auðmundr, which can be compared to the spelling ooþbiarn for Auðbiorn ' on U 1062. The name Auðviðr is very unusual, it is not recorded in the runic inscriptions and was rare in the Middle Ages. The father's name was Biörn. The mother's name in accusative form is Fasthæiði. The female name Fasthœiðr is only known from U 1132, but names compounded with the adjective stem fast- are very common.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGimo hembygdsförening\n\"Uppland Runestone - U 1132\".

        "content": "Claudio Vicuña Subercaseaux (1875 – May 21, 1956) was a Chilean agriculturist and politician, member of the Liberal Democratic Party. He served as a deputy and a state minister during the presidencies of Presidents Ramón Barros Luco and Arturo Alessandri.\n\n\n== Family and education ==\nHe was born in Santiago, Chile, in 1875, one of the seven children of Lucía Subercaseaux Vicuña and Claudio Vicuña Guerrero, who was a deputy and a state minister during the presidency of President José Manuel Balmaceda. He studied primary and secondary education at the Colegio de los Sagrados Corazones de Santiago.He married Julia Ossa Lynch, with whom he had six children.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn the political arena, he was a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, a party that, when divided into Alliance and Unionists, was among the former and served as president of that group in 1924 and 1925. Additionally, he was a member of the executive board of the same.In the 1912 parliamentary elections, he ran as a candidate for deputy for Santiago, being elected for the legislative period 1912–1915. In his tenure, he was an effective collaborator in the Commission of Foreign Relations and Colonization, in the study of projects that he had to sponsor or let pass laws, for example, navigation with Austria; the embassy of the United States; reform of the consular law and others that were of utmost importance.Parallel to this, during the government of President Ramón Barros Luco, on August 8, 1912, he was appointed as the titular Minister of National Defense, a position he held until January 15, 1913. During his tenure in office, aviation was created, the Aviation School was founded, and the decree of the fortifications of the country was signed. Likewise, at that time, he commissioned Armstrong House of England and Bethlehem of the United States, the largest caliber cannons that were located in the fortifications of Arica, Valparaíso, Iquique, and Talcahuano.Later, in the 1915 parliamentary elections, he was re-elected as a deputy, but for La Victoria and Melipilla, for the period 1915–1918. On that occasion, he joined the Permanent Commission of War and Navy. On the other hand, he was one of the organizers of Chile's attendance at the San Francisco, California Exhibition in 1915, which failed due to the exceptional circumstances of public finance, which were caused by the World War I and the paralysis of the nation's sources of income: the import of saltpeter.Later, in June 1924, he was appointed by President Arturo Alessandri as a state counselor. Subsequently, on January 29, 1925, he was appointed by the president of the Government Junta, Emilio Bello Codesido, as Minister of Agriculture, Industry, and Colonization, a position he held with the return to the presidency of Arturo Alessandri, until October 2 of the same year. Simultaneously, between July 1 and 27, he acted as Minister of Public Works, Commerce, and Communications, replacing Francisco Mardones Otaíza on an interim basis.Among other activities, he was a member of the National Agricultural Society (SNA) and the Club de La Unión. He died in Santiago on May 21, 1956, at the age of 81.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClaudio Vicuña Subercaseaux on the Political History portal of the Library of the National Congress of Chile.",

It has been called \"Perhaps the most reliable account of the life of Bully Hayes.\"\nClune had written about Hayes in an episode of his 1938 radio series Scallywags of the Pacific. He also wrote about him in his 1938 book Free and Easy Land.\nClune worked on the book in 1969. \"The trouble is to separate fact and fiction,\" he said.\nPacific Island Monthly said \"It’s a very readable and useful compilation, and it does put the story of Hayes into clearer and truer focus  than anything hitherto published...\nAs put together by Clune, from a mass of often contradictory material, this history of Bully Hayes is readable, lively and colourful.\"\nThe Sydney Morning Herald called it \"lively reading, full of action.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tameer-e Hayat (Urdu: تعمیر حیات) is a biweekly Urdu magazine published by Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama since 1963. Founded under the editorship of Mohammad al-Hasani, it is currently overseen by Shamsul Haq Nadwi. The magazine follows a biweekly schedule, releasing on the 10th and 25th of each month. It serves as a platform for Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama to address religious and global concerns, with a specific focus on the dynamics of Indian society. Also, it interprets the thoughts, ideas, theories, and beliefs of Nadwatul Ulama. It is the successor to Al-Nadwa, the first magazine of Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama, founded by Shibli Nomani.\n\n\n== Historical overview ==\nOn November 10, 1963, Tameer-e Hayat was launched, with Mohammad al-Hasani appointed as its founding editor and Saeed-ur-Rahman Azmi Nadvi as his assistant. In May 1973, the editorship transitioned to Ishaq Jalees Nadwi, who held the position until July 12, 1979. Nayab Hasan Qasmi marked Ishaq Jalees Nadwi's tenure as the magazine's golden era. Following the passing of Mohammad al-Hasani on June 3, 1979, and Ishaq Jalees Nadwi on July 12, 1979, Abdul Noor was tasked with publishing a special issue commemorating these figures, with Shamsul Haq Nadwi and Mahmood al-Azhar Nadvi assisting him. Since then, Shamsul Haq Nadwi has assumed the role of regular editor and remains in that capacity to this day. Abul Hasan Ali Hasani Nadwi also patronized it. Till now it has published special issues on 4 persons named Abdus Salam Qidwai Nadwi, Mohammad al-Hasani, Wazeh Rashid Hasani Nadwi, Rabey Hasani Nadwi.\nMohammad al-Hasani, the founder of this magazine, outlined its objectives succinctly. The magazine aims to communicate the essence of Nadwatul Ulama's founding principles to Muslims, serving as a reminder of its core values, advocating for the continuity of its educational approach in response to societal changes. It seeks to foster unity and harmony within the Muslim community while promoting the dissemination of prophetic sciences, contributions to Islamic jurisprudence, and exploration of various Islamic disciplines. It endeavors to enrich the intellectual and spiritual lives of its readers by reconciling reason, faith, and contemporary knowledge to resolve apparent contradictions. Additionally, it aims to guide Muslims in navigating contemporary civilizational challenges, including those presented by the Western world.\n\n\n== Academic reception ==\nIt has received varied academic responses. Scholars such as Muhammad Sirajullah, a PhD holder from Delhi University, commend the magazine for its historical significance and groundbreaking content, which not only represents Islam on a global scale but also presents practical guidance for navigating the complexities of Indian society. Sirajullah highlights the magazine's accessible language and high-quality content as key factors in its broad appeal to readers. Nayab Hasan Qasmi, author of Darul Uloom Deoband Ka Sahafati Manzarnama, acknowledges its enduring popularity and distinguished position among renowned publications, attributing its success to its exceptional qualities. Mohammad Moosa, a PhD scholar from Panjab University, provides a detailed analysis of the magazine's unique attributes, emphasizing its role as a religious, intellectual, and reformative platform catering to diverse segments of the Muslim community. Moosa underscores its commitment to presenting scholarly, intellectual, and literary content in an accessible and universal style, contributing to its widespread popularity and distinct position within the Muslim community. Mohd. Sohaib Siddiqi from Aligarh Muslim University compares it with Al-Nadwa, the first magazine of Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama founded by Shibli Nomani. Obaidur Rahman from the University of Calcutta asserts that the magazine presents successful journalism by integrating scientific and literary aspects in a significant manner.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ayer Itam–Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway Bypass is a dual carriageway under construction in the city of George Town within the Malaysian state of Penang. The 6 km (3.7 mi) road will connect the inland neighbourhood of Farlim to the coastal Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway. Slated for completion by 2025, the bypass is part of the Penang Transport Master Plan, which aims to alleviate traffic congestion in the state through the implemention of three new roadways.\n\n\n== History ==\nIntroduced by the Penang state government in 2014, the Penang Transport Master Plan (PTMP) envisaged three new motorways intended to disperse traffic from the existing roads throughout George Town, in addition to a cross-strait tunnel which would connect the city with Seberang Perai. The three proposed roads are:\n\nPackage 1: North Coast Paired Road\nPackage 2: Ayer Itam–Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway Bypass\nPackage 3: George Town Inner Ring Road\n\nConsortium Zenith Construction (CZC) had been appointed the developer of the three roads in 2013 through an open tender process. Formed in 2012, CZC comprised Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) – which had previously built venues for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing – and local firm Zenith Construction. In exchange for the three roads and the tunnel, CZC was granted exclusive development rights for 44.5 ha (110 acres) of land at Gurney Bay, negating the need for the imposition of toll charges to finance the construction.\nAt the time, the Ayer Itam–Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway Bypass was projected to halve the commute time between Farlim and the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway by up to 50%, with a speed limit of 70 km/h (43 mph). Of the three planned roadways, the bypass was given the highest priority due to the traffic congestion at Farlim and the surrounding residential areas. As the route traverses the hilly terrain between Farlim and Green Lane, three twin tunnels – measuring a total of nearly 2 km (1.2 mi) – would be bored into the hills to minimise environmental impacts. The elevated sections have a total length of approximately 4.2 km (2.6 mi), while the at-grade sections add up to 1.8 km (1.1 mi). The bypass is estimated to cost RM851 million.\nThe three roadways received approval from federal government environmental regulators in 2017. In 2019, the state government signed an agreement with CZC to implement Package 2, followed by a groundbreaking ceremony in November that year. Despite this, construction only began in 2021 and is expected to be completed by 2025. Construction of the bypass has reached 50% as of February 2024.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJalan Bukit Kukus Paired Road\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Kampu-i-mu'alla, the State Troops or the Royal Camp, was the trained division of the Sikh Khalsa Army of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In 1822, after Ranjit Singh gave employment to the European mercenaries, the Fauj-i-Ain was divided into the Kampu-i-mu'alla and the Fauj-i-Khas. Till 1836, the Kampu-i-mu'alla was the larger unit of the Fauj-i-Ain and led by either a Hindu or a Sikh general, while the smaller unit, the Fauj-i-Khas, was commanded by Europeans. These troops were encamped in Lahore and moved according to the orders of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who was the commander-in-chief of the Fauj-i-Ain. \n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Sukerchakia forces inherited by Ranjit Singh from his father and grandfather comprised irregular cavalry well-suited to meet the contingencies presented in the northwest frontier of the Indian subcontinent in the eighteenth century. The meteoric ascendance of the Company impressed upon Ranjit Singh the importance of learning the enemy's art of warfare, and on gaining control, the Sikh leader commenced training a section of his army in the art of European (British) warfare in the first decade of the nineteenth century. The Kampu-i-mu'alla was in readiness to protect the eastern Satluj frontier of the Sikh Empire against invasion from the territories under the protection of the East India Company.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nIn the early years, Ranjit Singh's standing army comprised principally irregular cavalry with a small section of trained cavalry and infantry. The formal divisions in the Sikh Khalsa Army emerged after 1823, the year the Sikh army faced the challenge of the Durrani Empire in the Battle of Nowshera, fought in the trans-Indus region. Ranjit Singh's first-hand experience along this frontier made it clear that a single force would not be able to meet the challenge posed along the two frontiers of his empire.\n\n\n== Size ==\nThe earliest trained cavalry in the Sikh Khalsa Army were deserters from the Company's army. By 1808, a section of mounted troops in the Royal Camp went through a cavalry drill. Between 1819 and 1838, the strength of the trained cavalry in the Kampu-i-mu'alla saw a five-fold rise, from 837 to 4,090. The first mention of infantry in the Sikh Khalsa Army is in 1803. In three decades beginning 1811, the enrolment of foot soldiers saw a ten-fold rise, while the strength of the artillery increased fourfold.\n\n\n== Battles ==\n\nBattle of Kashmir (1814) \nBattle of Multan (1818) \nBattle of Kashmir (1819) \nBattle of Nowshera (1823) \nBattle of Sirikot (1824)\n\n\n== Commanders ==\n\nAccording to Umdat-ut-tawarikh, Sohan Lal Suri's Lahore court chronicle, the following incumbents led the Lahore Troops: \nDewan Mokham Chand till his death in 1814\nLala Ram Dayal, grandson of Dewan Mokham Chand, till his death in1820\nMisr Diwan Chand till his death in 1825\nMisr Sukh Dayal, brother of Misr Diwan Chand, till 1824\nTej Singh, from 1834 to 1836\nIn 1836, Maharaja Ranjit Singh gave the joint command of the Kampu-i-mu'alla to Tej Singh and Ventura. \nThe Kampu-i-mu’alla and the Fauj-i-Khas played a supportive and maintenance role from 1824 till the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1839.\n^   ISBN978-81-910526-1-9\n\n\n== References ==",

Its population is 1,741 (as of 2024).\n\n\n== History ==\nYunakivka was founded in 1685 by sotnik S. Yunok, comprising lands he owned which were farmed by migrants from Volhynia. It was part of the Sumy Regiment of the Cossack Hetmanate. Prior to the emancipation reform of 1861 Yunakivka was a subject of the House of Golitsyn, which owned 7,312 serfs in the surrounding area. A fabric factory was constructed in the village in 1891, providing an economic lifeline to inhabitants. A 1893 riot over the sale of the village's sugar factory to the neighbouring village of Kyianytsia resulted in the arrests of 33 people.Yunakivka was occupied by the Red Army on 3 December 1918 amidst the Ukrainian–Soviet War, and was the site of a battle between the Red and White armies in August 1919. The village was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. During the German occupation, four people were executed and 54 tortured.As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Yunakivka's location six kilometres from the Russia–Ukraine border has led to threats against the local population. The village's kindergarten was destroyed, causing some families to leave, but the majority of residents have refused to flee.Yunakivka is known for the classical Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God. It is one of three Eastern Orthodox churches built by the House of Golitsyn, and the only one which has survived to the present day. Mostly destroyed by youths during the 1960s, it has been undergoing restorations since 2004. The church was subordinated to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in 2018 after a period of conflict over the site between the UOC(MP) and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nOleksandra Kalychenko, Soviet railroad worker.\nLeonid Matviienko, singer.\nMykola Orkhimenko, Hero of the Soviet Union.\nYevhen Panchenko, bandurist.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ben Hall the Bushranger is a 1947 Australian historical novel by Frank Clune about the bushranger Ben Hall. It tried to focus on Hall's motivations.He wrote this and Dark Outlaw as historical novels while researching his large non fiction book Wild Colonial Boys.The West Australian said \"the romance and adventure... make an attractive narrative.\"Smith's Weekly said Clune \"can give you the scenes, he can describe their faces, their huts, their names and tneir clothes. He can give a detailed and very stirring account of their actions. But when it comes to explaining their insides and what makes them tick, he is lost; they all \"revert to type\"; and that is the difference between the Australian of Francis Ratcliffe and the Australian of Frank Clune's various books on travels through Australia.\"The Sunday Times said it was \"not a very deep character analy-sis - about half-way between actions and basic motives. And in places the story lumbers and the intelligence of the reader is under-estimated by pointing out tacticns that are obvious by the dialogue. Nevertheless, the book is well worth a place on anybody's shelf, for its historical as well as its entertainment value.\"ABC Weekly declared \"Frank Clune has used both hands to apply his colours, and if at times the story degenerates into  something of the old penny-dreadful it is alwavs interesting.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBen Hall the Bushranger at AustLit",

        "content": "Myropillia (Ukrainian: Миропілля, pronounced [mɪroˈpʲiʎːɐ] ) is a village in Sumy Raion, Sumy Oblast, Ukraine. It is the administrative centre of Myropillia rural hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Its population is 2,873 (as of 2001).\n\n\n== History ==\nMyropillia was established around 1650 by immigrants from Volhynia. According to local legend, the settlement was named for a local river known as the Myrna Pilka, which dried up around the time of alleged 15th- and 16th-century settlement. Myropillia was granted the status of a city in 1670, and had its own sotnia within the Sumy Regiment of the Cossack Hetmanate. By the beginning of the 20th century, Myropillia had a population of nearly 20,000, but much of them either perished or left as a result of collectivisation, the Holodomor, and World War II.During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Myropillia's location five kilometres from the Russia–Ukraine border has led to significant problems for the village. Village infrastructure has been repeatedly attacked by Russian forces, and, according to local activist Tetiana Nahulova, as much as 60% of the population has fled.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to the 2001 Ukrainian census, Myropillia has a population of 2,873. 95.61% of respondents to the 2001 census in Myropillia stated that their native language was Ukrainian. Of the remainder, 4.07% stated that their native language was Russian, 0.17% said that their native language was Armenian, and 0.03% each answered that their native language was Belarusian, Moldovan (Romanian), or German.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nAnna Hidora, painter.\nBorys Lazariev, physicist.\nKost Moshchenko, museologist, ethnographer, painter, architect, and historian.\nHnat Mykhailychenko, member of the Central Rada.\nVitalii Piddubnyi, soldier of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine killed during the War in Donbas.\nIvan Povkh, water turbine physicist.\nAhapii Shamrai, literary historian.\nAnatolii Taran, poet and journalist.\nIvan Yeremenko, educator.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is the capital of the Sad rural hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Its population is 2,348 (as of 2024).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe present-day village of Sad was founded in 1905 as an agricultural research centre for scientists in Kharkov Governorate. The goal of the centre was to study conditions of chernozem and forest steppe, as well as its effects on agriculture. The research centre was briefly replaced by a sovkhoz between 1930 and 1934, and ceased operations as a result of World War II between October 1941 and September 1943. The centre was reorganised into the village of Doslidne on 5 January 1977, and subsequently renamed to Sad on 16 February 1977 by a decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.Nadia Masalitna has been Sad's mayor since 1994, making her one of the longest-serving politicians in Ukraine's modern history, particularly among female politicians.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "August-Martin Euler (May 9, 1908, in Kassel – February 4, 1966, in Brussels) was a German politician (FDP, later FVP and German Party). He was state chairman of the FDP in Hesse from 1947 to 1956, a member of the German Bundestag from 1949 to 1958, and chairman of the FDP parliamentary group there from 1951 to 1952. In 1956, he led a breakaway from the FDP faction, the so-called Euler Group.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nAfter graduating from high school, Euler studied law in Marburg and then worked in various legal positions from 1936 to 1944. Since 1939, he has been the general representative for chemistry in Berlin as legal counsel for IG Farben. Euler, who had undergone training with the police, was drafted into the SS Police Regiment 2 Brandenburg on November 29, 1944, as a police officer for the Waffen-SS.In 1945–46, he was district administrator in the Hersfeld district. He then worked as a lawyer. In 1953, he belonged to Club 53 around Arnold Bode. In September 1958, he became Director General of the Supply Department of EURATOM.\nHe was the father of the later Hamburg FDP parliamentary group leader, Maja Stadler-Euler.\n\n\n== Political party ==\nEuler was one of the co-founders of the Liberal Democratic Party, later the FDP, in Kassel in 1945 and then throughout Hesse on December 29, 1945. In 1946, he initially became state manager, and in June 1947, he became state chairman of the FDP as the successor to Georg Ludwig Fertsch. He held the office until he left the party in 1956. At the founding party conference of the FDP in Heppenheim, Euler was elected to the executive board of the federal party. At the 1949 federal party conference of the FDP in Bremen, he wanted to enforce a commitment to rearmament but failed due to the anti-militarist sentiment of the majority of delegates.\n\nAt the meeting of the Federal Main Committee of the FDP on September 21, 1950, he spoke out in favor of resolving not only the incompatibility of membership in the FDP with membership in the Association of those Persecuted by the Nazi Regime but also with membership in the German Peace Society. While the first demand was passed with a clear majority because of the KPD's decisive influence on the VVN, the proposal regarding the peace society failed; after all, Harald Abatz, an FDP member, was the federal chairman of the DFG. At the federal party conference in September 1951 in Munich, he ran against the previous deputy federal chairman, Hermann Schäfer, and was narrowly defeated by 114 votes to 139.\nTogether with Hans-Joachim von Merkatz, Euler advocated a rigorous end to denazification in 1950. Both sought to exonerate the so-called main culprits and those accused of all current or impending sanctions at the time.Euler was one of the strictest representatives of the citizen bloc orientation of the FDP. In 1952, he called for the Baden-Württemberg FDP/DVP, which he described as demi-Marxists, to be excluded from the party after Reinhold Maier entered into a coalition with the SPD in the southwestern state.\nThe FDP's coalition change in North Rhine-Westphalia in 1956 from the CDU to the SPD ultimately led to a group of FDP members and MPs under Euler's leadership breaking away from the party in February 1956 and founding the Free People's Party (FVP). With the FVP, Euler came to the German Party (DP) in March 1957.\n\n\n== MP ==\nEuler was a member of the state parliament in Hesse in 1946–47, 1950–51, and 1954–55. He was also parliamentary group leader there in 1946–47 and 1954–55.\nFrom 1947 to 1949, he sat on the Economic Council of the United Economic Area for Hesse, where he was deputy chairman of the FDP parliamentary group. Euler was a member of the German Bundestag from 1949 to 1958. In the 1949 federal election, he was directly elected to parliament in the Fritzlar-Homberg federal constituency with 27.8% of the vote, but with a clear lead over the SPD candidate (22.9%), and was able to retain the constituency in 1953. In 1949, he initially spoke out in favor of a joint faction with the German Party.\nInitially deputy parliamentary group leader, he was elected chairman of the FDP parliamentary group on January 10, 1951, with 23 to 22 votes against the previous incumbent, Hermann Schäfer.Just one year later, however, he no longer stood for office. In his first electoral term, he was also chairman of the expert committee for the reorganization of the federal territory, in which he represented far-reaching demands for a reduction in the number of German states.  In 1953, he became deputy group leader again.\nTogether with the so-called ministerial wing (including the four previous FDP ministers of the Adenauer II cabinet: Franz Blücher, Fritz Neumayer, Victor-Emanuel Preusker, and Hermann Schäfer), Euler, after whom these 16 MPs were also called the Euler Group, left on December 23rd. February 1956, the FDP parliamentary group. The group founded the FVP, which merged with the German Party a year later.\nTowards the end of the electoral term, he became chairman of the Bundestag Committee on Nuclear Issues for the DP/FVP parliamentary group. In the 1957 federal election, he returned to parliament on the DP's Hessian state list. He resigned his mandate on September 10, 1958, when he moved to EURATOM. He was a member of the first Federal Assembly in 1949 and the second in 1954.\nSee also: Election of the German Federal President in 1949 and Election of the German Federal President in 1954\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\nJochen Lengemann: MdL Hesse. 1808–1996.

        "content": "Tom Trento (born 1951 or 1952) is an American conservative activist, radio and web show host, and founder of the Florida-based counter-jihad group The United West, the successor to the Florida Security Council. He has also been the national security chairman for the Tea Party National Convention.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nTrento hails from Jersey, and later studied at the Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton under Walid Phares, a leading scholar of \"stealth jihad\". The United West website states that he has degrees in Law Enforcement, AS, Ocean County College, Theology, BA, Moody Bible Institute, and Philosophy, MA, Denver Seminary. He identifies as an evangelical Christian, and was noted as an anti-abortion activist in the late 1980s, who was once arrested for trespassing outside a Denver abortion clinic.\nTogether with Florida Republican state representative Adam Hasner, Trento launched the Florida Security Council in 2007, the predecessor to The United West. In 2008, the Florida Security Council took part in distributing the DVD Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West, which according to Trento has been \"extremely effective in waking people up\" to the threat of radical Islam. The associated group Security Research Associates then received funding from the Donors Capital Fund. In 2009, Trento hosted Dutch politician Geert Wilders at a freedom of expression conference. He was one of nineteen co-authors of the Center for Security Policy publication Shariah: The Threat To America in 2010.\nThe United West was launched in March 2011 at an event that was attended by Donald Trump, who posed for photographs together with Frank Gaffney and Elisabeth Sabaditsch-Wolff. Trento and his group has claimed that the U.S. and the West \"are at war with Muslims and Islam\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has designated the group as an anti-Muslim \"hate group\". The group has been described, and describes itself as a counter-jihad organization, with strong support for Israel, and is based in Lake Worth.\nTrento has also been the national security chairman for the Tea Party National Convention, and a director of the Tea Party Founding Fathers.\nIn 2013, Trento held a controversial speech at an event at the September 11 Memorial in Patriots Park, Venice, Florida, attended by the Venice mayor and public officials, in which he denounced not only radical Islam, but \"all Islam\". In 2015, he called out Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel at a rally for hiring a \"terrorist\", due to the sheriff's decision to hire deputy Nezar Hamze, who was also the director of the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).\nTrento has later collaborated with former Trump administration Director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Thomas Homan. In November 2022, The United West organized a private fundraising event at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, which said it premiered a television program associated with Homan's Defend the Border and Save Lives project.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTom Trento on Twitter",

It is usually a prostrate perennial plant with imparipinnate leaves with 5 to 7 egg-shaped leaflets, the narrower end towards the base, and racemes of 3 to 7 purple flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona oligophylla is a prostrate or occasionally ascending annual perennial plant, that typically grows to a height of about 15 cm (5.9 in) and has many stems. The leaves are imparipinnate, mostly 10–40 mm (0.39–1.57 in) long with 5 to 7 egg-shaped leaflets with the narrower end towards the base, mostly 2–15 mm (0.079–0.591 in) long and 1–8 mm (0.039–0.315 in) wide with stipules about 3 mm (0.12 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are purple, arranged in racemes of 3 to 7, 20–100 mm (0.79–3.94 in) long, on a peduncle up to 0.5 mm (0.020 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base to form a tube about 1.5 mm (0.059 in) long, with lobes 3 or 4 times longer than the tube. The standard petal is 8–10 mm (0.31–0.39 in) long, the wings about 7 mm (0.28 in) long and the keel about 8–9 mm (0.31–0.35 in) long and 2 mm (0.079 in) deep. Flowering usually occurs from August to October, and the fruit is a cylindrical pod 12–15 mm (0.47–0.59 in) long on a stalk about 1 mm (0.039 in) long, with the remains of the strongly curved style about 4 mm (0.16 in) long.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona oligophylla was first formally described in 1864 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller. The specific epithet (oligophylla) means \"few-leaved\".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThis species of swainsona is widespread in the south of the Northern Territory, north-eastern South Australia, south-western Queensland and north-western New South Wales, where it grows on clay-loam soils in well-watered areas.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Carl Georg Franz Hehn (Russian: Карл Георг Франц Ген; 25 April 1821 – 19 February 1875) was a Baltic German agricultural scientist and a professor at the University of Dorpat (Tartu). He conducted research on soil liming, effect of climate on agriculture, and was a founder of the Baltic Forest Society in 1865.\nHehn was born in Odenpa, Livonia, to pastor Bernhard Gottlieb Hoehn (1776-1856) and his wife Caroline Körber (1785-1878). He went to the Dorpat Gymnasium (1833-1838) and then to the University where he received a candidate's degree with a dissertation Ueber den Reichtum des Bodens. He then taught at Pskov before returning to Dorpat and studying agricultural sciences. In 1849 he became a teacher at the Dorpat Veterinary School and in 1858 he received a master's degree with a dissertation Die Intensität der livländischen Landwirtschaft. He managed an estate in Pskov where he introduced land ownership by peasants. In 1860 he took a position as secretary of the Livonia public benefit and economic society and worked there for 8 years. During this period he edited the society's periodical Baltische Wochenschrift für Landwirtschaft, Gewerbefleiß und Handel and organized the first all-Baltic agricultural fair in 1865. An agricultural school (now Riga Technical University) was created in 1862 and in 1867-68 and Hehn was appointed the first professor of agriculture. He became a full professor of agricultural technology in 1873 and taught courses in soil science, plant sciences, economics, cattle breeding and the history of agriculture. In 1874 he began to write a dissertation on Der Einfluss des Klimas auf die Baltische Landwirtschaft but did not complete it as he died from tuberculosis.\n\n\n== References ==",

He became a back row forward during his time in the RAF, having previously played centre for Pontypool. In the 1960s, Jones played his rugby with Ebbw Vale and had a run of 150 consecutive matches.Jones won three Wales caps in 1963, debuting against Scotland at Murrayfield. He scored what was at the time the quickest known try by a Wales player in his next match, against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, that remains the fastest try by a Welsh forward. It also made him the first Ebbw Vale recruit to score a try for Wales.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Wales national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGraham Jones at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "German retribution against the people of Bydgoszcz (1939) was mass war crimes committed by the German occupiers against the civilian population of Bydgoszcz of Polish and Jewish origin, between September and December 1939.\nMass arrests and executions of Bydgoszcz residents, carried out primarily by Wehrmacht soldiers and Einsatzgruppen officers, initially took place in an atmosphere of chaos and were a retaliation for the events of the so-called \"Bloody Sunday\" in Bydgoszcz (3–4 September 1939) and for the resistance offered by the local Civic Guard to the advancing Wehrmacht units. The ad hoc reprisals later turned into an organized extermination campaign, aimed at the liquidation of the Polish political and intellectual elite in Bydgoszcz, with the main executor being the paramilitary Selbstschutz. During the first four months of the occupation, the Germans murdered up to 5000 residents of Bydgoszcz and the Bydgoszcz County in secret or public executions, of which probably between 1500 and 1900 victims were from Bydgoszcz itself.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\nIn the first months of the German occupation, Pomerania was the region of Poland where Nazi terror took the most brutal form. Polish historians estimate that between September 1939 and spring 1940, the occupiers murdered between 36,000 and 50,000 Poles and Jews in Pomerania. Meanwhile, German historian Dieter Schenk calculated that between 1939 and 1945, the Nazis murdered between 52,794 and 60,750 people in direct executions in these areas. With the exception of a few hundred, almost all of these individuals lost their lives in the first months after the German troops entered. Even against this backdrop, German retribution against the people of Bydgoszcz took on exceptional proportions, making the city one of the symbols of German atrocities committed in occupied Poland. The human losses suffered by the population of Bydgoszcz during World War II are currently estimated at 10,000.\nSeveral reasons can be distinguished for why German terror took such a brutal form in Bydgoszcz. The Nazis found their propagandistic justification for dealing with the people of Bydgoszcz primarily in the events of the so-called \"Bloody Sunday\" in Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberger Blutsonntag) on 3–4 September 1939. In Polish historiography, these events are described as the bloody suppression by the Polish military of a German diversionary action in the city, while in German historiography, they are portrayed as a pogrom against local Volksdeutsche. Goebbels' propaganda made great efforts to portray the events in Bydgoszcz in a stirring manner and to provide a propagandistic justification for the German policy of extermination conducted in Polish territories (especially in Pomerania).\n\nIn the first days of the occupation, German reprisals were also provoked by the resistance offered by the local Civic Guard to the advancing Wehrmacht units, which the Germans, in violation of international humanitarian law, regarded as a guerrilla formation. Later, both of these events became a pretext for the occupiers to carry out the extermination of the Polish political and intellectual elite in Bydgoszcz, as well as to deal with the Jewish population. The reprisals in Bydgoszcz were part of a broader extermination campaign carried out throughout Pomerania as part of the so-called Intelligenzaktion.\nIn German repression policy aimed at the population of Bydgoszcz, Professor Włodzimierz Jastrzębski distinguished three phases:\n\nFrom September 5 to 12, 1939 – reprisals were carried out by Wehrmacht soldiers and Einsatzgruppen officers to pacify the city and suppress the alleged \"Polish uprising in Bydgoszcz\". Many executions were carried out in public places.\nUntil the end of November 1939 – Sicherheitspolizei and Selbstschutz organized secret mass executions in remote locations near Bydgoszcz.\nFrom December 1939 – a kind of \"normalization\" occurred. Mass killings were abandoned, and Poles were subjected to terror organized by the Nazi police and judicial system.\n\n\n== Crimes committed in the first days of the occupation ==\n\nThe Wehrmacht units entered Bydgoszcz on Tuesday, 5 September 1939. On the same day, a detachment of the Schutzstaffel (Einsatzkommando 1/IV) led by SS-Sturmbannführer Helmut Bischoff also appeared in the city. Bischoff's unit was part of Einsatzgruppe IV (commanded by SS-Brigadeführer Lothar Beutel) – a special operational group (Einsatzgruppen) of the security police and Sicherheitsdienst, following in the wake of the units of the German 4th Army.\nAt that time, the regular Polish army soldiers had already withdrawn from Bydgoszcz. However, the Germans encountered fierce resistance from members of the Bydgoszcz Civic Guard. Particularly intense fighting broke out in the working-class district of Szwederowo, where railway workers belonging to the Railway Military Training under the command of Franciszek Marchlewski were active. Two German soldiers were killed in the fighting, and a major officer was captured. The Bydgoszcz Civic Guard only surrendered their weapons after receiving assurance from General Eccard von Gablenz (commander of the \"Netze\" battle group) that their rights, as due to regular troops, would be respected. However, the Germans did not keep their promises. The captured members of the Civic Guard were handed over to the officers of Einsatzgruppe IV. Some prisoners (about 40 in number) were beaten to death with metal rods by Schutzstaffel men. The rest, including both leaders of the Civic Guard – Konrad Fiedler and Marian Maczuga – were shot on the Bielawki hills in Bydgoszcz.\nIn the first few days after the Germans occupied the city, chaos prevailed in Bydgoszcz. Concurrently with taking control of various districts of Bydgoszcz, the occupiers carried out mass arrests of civilians. The victims were primarily workers, railway employees, small craftsmen, lower-ranking officials, and high school students – as members of the Civic Guard mainly came from these social groups. In the ad hoc executions carried out by Einsatzgruppe IV and the Wehrmacht (especially soldiers from the 1st Signal Regiment), hundreds of residents of the city were killed. General Walter Braemer estimated that between September 5 and 8, at least 400 people were shot in Bydgoszcz. Meanwhile, Werner Kampe calculated the number of killed residents of the city during this time to be between 200 and 300 people. The first executions were quite spontaneous and chaotic. Polish civilians were shot at various locations in the city during this time: in the barracks of the 16th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment on Szubińska Street, in the barracks of the 15th Light Artillery Regiment on Gdańska Street, at the city stadium on Mościckiego Avenue (now Sportowa Street), at the airport on Jagiellońska Street, near the wall of the prison on Wały Jagiellońskie Street, and in the vicinity of the municipal hospital on Bielawki. The brutality of the Germans was fueled by the belief that Bydgoszcz was engulfed in a \"Polish uprising\". This was evidenced by the occasional shots fired by \"partisans\" in the city. However, it is difficult to assess how many times German soldiers were actually attacked by Poles and how many times these incidents were simply the result of uncontrolled gunfire, caused by inexperienced and \"partisan psychosis\"-ridden German recruits.\nOn 8 September 1939, Major General Walter Braemer (commander of the 580th rear area army) was appointed as the military commander of Bydgoszcz. However, just two days later, actual power in the city was taken over by Werner Kampe – the head of the local Nazi Party cell (later, from the end of September, the Lord Mayor of Bydgoszcz). In the city and surrounding areas, the first structures of Selbstschutz – a paramilitary formation composed of representatives of the German national minority inhabiting the pre-war territory of the Second Polish Republic – began to be formed. Due to the chaos in the city and the alleged threat from \"ubiquitous\" Polish partisans, the command of the German 4th Army ordered Braemer (a pre-war active member of the Schutzstaffel) to conduct a more organized \"cleansing operation\".\nThe general crackdown on the residents of Bydgoszcz began on September 8. Braemer issued an order on that day for the cleansing of the city from \"criminal Polish elements\". German soldiers and police officers cordoned off Polish-inhabited districts and systematically searched house by house, apartment by apartment. In case of finding weapons (which could include commemorative sabers, hunting rifles, or police batons), male occupants were shot on the spot. The remaining \"suspects\" were directed to a makeshift prison organized in the barracks of the 15th Light Artillery Regiment. By the morning of September 9, around 400–500 people were imprisoned, and by September 10, the number of detainees increased to 1,400. The purges primarily affected districts considered by the occupiers as the most dangerous, such as Szwederowo. On September 10, the command of the 580th rear area army evaluated in the war diary that: [...] in the vilest district inhabited by the commune, about 120 people were shot, and another 900 were arrested. Excesses must have occurred during the \"cleansing operation\" because Braemer felt compelled to issue an order specifying that every person found with a weapon should be brought before the Sondergericht, rather than immediately shot. Bischoff's orders went in a completely different direction; he ordered to shoot all persons who in any way seem suspicious, declaring at the same time to his Schutzstaffel men that in this action, everyone can prove themselves a true man.\nOn September 9, the first public execution took place in the Old Market Square in Bydgoszcz, where 20 people were killed. The Poles gathered in the square before the execution were beaten with rifle butts, forced to fall and rise, and stand for hours with their hands raised. When a German soldier was shot on the night of September 9 to 10, Braemer ordered that the next day, another 20 hostages be shot in the Bydgoszcz market square. On September 10, five other civilians were shot in the square – allegedly while attempting to escape. It was not uncommon for local Volksdeutsche to pass among the rows of detained Poles and Jews, pointing out supposed participants of the Bydgoszcz \"Bloody Sunday\" to the escort. These people were then separated from the rest of the prisoners, marked with a cross sign using white paint, and shot. In this way, among others, 20 Poles detained on Saperów Street perished.\nIn total, during Braemer's tenure (September 8–11, 1939), around 370 Poles were murdered in Bydgoszcz. Out of this group, about 120–150 people were ordered by SS-Brigadeführer Beutel (in agreement with Braemer) to be shot by Einsatzgruppe IV officers in the forests near Bydgoszcz.\nOn September 11, the German Supreme Command of the Army (Oberkommando des Heeres) informed the 4th Army that Hitler, due to the rebellious Polish population in Bydgoszcz, ordered the Reichsführer-SS to take 500 hostages and undertake the most severe measures (summary executions) until the city is pacified. The army is to be ordered not to interfere with the Reichsführer-SS authorities. The extermination action in Bydgoszcz then took a new course. Poles accused of participating in the \"Bloody Sunday\" and intelligentsia were now being liquidated. The main role in the repressive actions was played by Selbstschutz, its formations, and Ordnungspolizei. On September 18, Einsatzgruppe IV officers directed the first transport consisting of 62 people from Bydgoszcz to the Dachau concentration camp. At the same time, a secret order was issued to the Dachau commander to shoot all prisoners upon the arrival of the transport – except for Canon Józef Schulz. Large roundups continued in various districts. On the night of October 1 to 2, 2,000 Poles were temporarily arrested. On October 6, on the orders of the mayor Kampe, a large roundup was organized, during which anyone who did not have a certificate of employment issued by the Employment Office was detained.\nIn the first weeks of the occupation, the director of the city gardens in Bydgoszcz, Marian Gunzel, and other Polish employees of the Bydgoszcz city administration disappeared without a trace. On 24 September 1939, they were summoned by the Kreisleiter Kampe to a meeting at the town hall. They did not return home that day and remained unaccounted for throughout the entire period of the occupation. Only after the war, in German documents left in the courthouse in Bydgoszcz, was a document found (drawn up in April 1940 for the Ministry of Justice of the Reich), which informed that the Kreisleiter ordered the officials to be taken to the Gdańsk Forest and shot there. Kampe also ordered the murder of their closest relatives to \"avoid creating martyrs\".\nThe directives of the military and civilian authorities of the Nazi Germany regarding Bydgoszcz were exceptionally radical, and the actions taken on-site in the first days of the occupation were brutal and arbitrary. Officially, this was a reaction to the sporadic shots allegedly fired by partisans in the city. However, reality did not reflect these claims in any way. Between September 6 and 11 (after the Civic Guard had already laid down their arms), only 2 German soldiers were killed in Bydgoszcz, and 2 others were wounded. According to the German historian Hans Umbreit, the decimation of certain social groups partially overlapped with the methods by which the military and police sought to restore internal order seemingly legally... by conducting an uncompromising fight against partisans, imposing severe penalties for possessing weapons, and undertaking merciless retaliatory actions against innocent people, Hitler's program was partially implemented.\n\n\n== Internment camp in Bydgoszcz ==\n\nThe residents of Bydgoszcz, arrested during successive \"cleansing actions\", were placed in a makeshift internment camp (Internierungslager) established on the premises of the barracks of the 15th Light Artillery Regiment at 147 Gdańska Street. The decision to establish this camp was most likely made before the Germans occupied the city. Already on 5 September 1939, the head of the civilian administration board under the command of the 4th Army, SS-Oberführer Fritz Hermann, instructed his field delegates in a written directive to escort arrested Poles who are not trustworthy to internment camps. One of the camps mentioned in this document was the Bydgoszcz Internierungslager.\nUsually, the arrested residents of Bydgoszcz were initially taken to assembly points located in the barracks of the 62nd Infantry Regiment at Warszawska Street and in the barracks of the 16th Uhlan Regiment at Szubińska Street. Preliminary personal checks were conducted there, followed by a decision on whether to transfer the detainee to the appropriate camp in the barracks of the 15th Light Artillery Regiment or to release them.\nIn the barracks at 147 Gdańska Street, the internees were placed in stables or in rooms of the former armory. The camp had deplorable living conditions. For example, teachers imprisoned in the so-called block no. 5 (former stables) were forced to sleep among piles of excrement and swarms of vermin. Very harsh conditions also prevailed in block no. 8 designated for Jews. The internees received meager food rations, and harsh lights were used at night, making sleep difficult for them. They were also forced to endure exhausting roll calls. The camp guards treated the prisoners with great brutality. In the camp office, members of the Einsatzgruppen (in the presence of the camp commandant, Baksa) conducted interrogations, often accompanied by beatings and torture. They tried to coerce the interrogated individuals into admitting membership in the Polish Western Union or other organizations promoting Polish identity. Some prisoners were sent to work on German farms. There were often individual murders committed there by members of the escort (they killed, for example, the most lice-infessted prisoners). Additionally, in September 1939, the Germans murdered about 28 people on the premises of the barracks or in their immediate vicinity.\nMaria Wardzyńska estimates that in September 1939 alone, about 3,500 people were imprisoned in the barracks of the 15th Light Artillery Regiment. However, it is difficult to establish the total number of prisoners who passed through the Bydgoszcz Internierungslager. German numerical data does not seem reliable in this regard. Firstly, compared to post-war accounts, they appear to be underestimated. Secondly, the number of internees was constantly changing. Large groups of prisoners were sent to agricultural work, some were released, some were handed over to the prosecutor's office at the Bydgoszcz Special Court, and some were resettled to central Poland. At the end of September 1939, a transport of about 150 people was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp. In mid-October, a similar-sized transport, consisting mostly of captured Polish soldiers, was sent to the concentration camp in Nowy Port in Gdańsk. New prisoners continued to arrive, especially with the intensification of actions against the Polish intelligentsia. Additionally, from the first days of October, internees were transported to remote locations near Bydgoszcz, where they were shot.\nOn 25 October 1939, the military administration in the occupied Polish territories was liquidated. The Bydgoszcz Internierungslager was then subordinated to the police authorities, and military guards were replaced by a police camp guard. The military authorities, by transferring the camp to police jurisdiction, also demanded its relocation from the barracks area, as they intended to use the buildings for the needs of Wehrmacht units stationed in Bydgoszcz. As a result, the frequency of deportations and executions increased significantly. In the last days of October, among others, the \"Jewish block\" was finally emptied. On 1 November 1939, the Internierungslager was moved to former ammunition warehouses in the Jachcice suburb. At that time, about 300 prisoners were still in the camp. By the end of December 1939, the Bydgoszcz Internierungslager was finally liquidated. Some prisoners were released, some were sent to forced labor in the depths of the Reich, and the rest were deported to the Stutthof concentration camp.\nArrested Poles were also held in several other places in Bydgoszcz. Some were taken to the Selbstschutz prison, located in the building of the former Polish Club at 50 Gdańska Street. Many people (mainly Polish Western Union activists) were also taken to the basement of the building at 6 Poniatowskiego Street, where the Bydgoszcz Gestapo headquarters were located. The arrested Poles were held there in appalling conditions and subjected to torture and various forms of harassment. At the Poniatowskiego Street building, at least 19 known residents of Bydgoszcz were killed in executions or as a result of mistreatment.\n\n\n== Activities of the German Special Court ==\n\nThe Nazi authorities were determined to exploit the propaganda potential of the distorted narrative surrounding the events of September 3 and 4, 1939. The task of officially judging and \"punishing\" Poles suspected of involvement in the incidents of the \"Bloody Sunday\" was entrusted to the Special Court in Bydgoszcz (German: Sondergericht Bromberg). The establishment of special courts in the occupied territories of Poland (including Bydgoszcz) was planned before 1 September 1939. Initially, the personnel of the Bydgoszcz court consisted of judges and prosecutors delegated from Piła. However, on September 17, Sondergericht Bromberg was reinforced by a group of lawyers sent from Berlin. The activities of the court were also heavily influenced by a special commission of the Kriminalpolizei, headed by Dr. Bernd Wehner. The commission provided the court with identified \"perpetrators, instigators, and accomplices\" supposedly involved in the incidents of the \"Bloody Sunday\". The activity of Sondergericht Bromberg was inaugurated personally by Roland Freisler, Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Justice of the Reich.\nThe Prosecutor's Office at the Special Court in Bydgoszcz began its work on 6 September 1939 (the day after the capture of Bydgoszcz by Wehrmacht units). The exact date of the start of operations by Sondergericht Bromberg is uncertain. Depending on the sources, it is stated to have occurred between September 8 and 10, 1939. Documents preserved from the Wehrmacht indicate that the court began its work on 9 September 1939. Just two days later, three death sentences were issued. Until July 1940, all death sentences issued by Sondergericht Bromberg were carried out by the execution platoon of the gendarmerie in the courtyard of the prison at 4 Wały Jagiellońskie Street.\nProceedings conducted before the Special Court in Bydgoszcz were a mockery of fair legal process. During these proceedings, not only basic principles of law were violated, but even the provisions of Nazi criminal procedure were disregarded. In cases related to the events of September 3 and 4, 1939, investigations were not conducted, but rather interrogations. The accused – including women and minors – were routinely tortured and intimidated to force confessions to the alleged crimes. As a result, absurd situations arose – on one occasion, a tortured Polish man confessed to killing a Volksdeutsch who had actually survived the \"Bloody Sunday\" unscathed. Polish witnesses were also intimidated, and they were often prevented from freely testifying. The investigation materials were usually concise and unreliable, and the indictments often relied on the testimony of one person or simply on a written report of the alleged crime. Defendants were prevented, on trivial pretexts, from calling witnesses in their defense. Witness testimonies were not translated into Polish, and defendants were not allowed to question the witnesses. Defendants who knew German and questioned the testimony of Volksdeutsche were denied the right to provide extensive explanations (they could only give short answers to questions asked of them), and were even accused of audacity. Polish testimonies were generally not believed when they contradicted the testimony of Germans. A common practice of German judges was to waive the oath for Polish witnesses, while maintaining this requirement for German witnesses. In cases where testimonies were mutually contradictory, Polish witnesses – as unsworn – were considered unreliable. During trials, judges did not hide their bias, insulting the accused as \"Polish Untermenschen\", \"Polish bandits\", \"rabble\", \"scum\", \"people unworthy of living among Germans\", or referring to them as \"members of a nation subject to the German nation\" (prosecutors acted similarly). Meanwhile, German lawyers, who theoretically were supposed to defend the accused Poles, typically remained completely passive. They usually did not even request permission to visit their clients or submit any evidence. During trials, they did not protest against the judges' and prosecutors' violation of the law, did not consult with their clients, did not question witnesses or defendants. In some cases, certain lawyers even requested the \"just punishment\" of their clients or even their condemnation to death.\nThe analysis of the court judgments in the cases related to the events of 3–4 September 1939, indicates that the court aimed to quickly convict as many people as possible. This goal was primarily served by the application of the previously unknown concept in German law of \"expanded aiding and abetting in murder\" (German: Mord nach erweiterten Mittäterbegriff). Poles were thus convicted of complicity in murder if during the incidents in Bydgoszcz on 3–4 September 1939, they spoke hostilely and insultingly towards Volksdeutsche; pointed out to soldiers or policemen the places from which insurgents were firing shots; helped to bring arrested Germans to military facilities or police stations, etc. A certain butcher was sentenced to death because he allegedly \"knocked a Volksdeutsch off his bike\". Even a Pole who pointed out to soldiers a bakery owned by a German, where they requisitioned several loaves of bread, was convicted. Poles were also mass sentenced under the charge of disturbing public peace. In this way, the Germans obtained a tool that allowed them to punish even passive participants in the \"Bloody Sunday\" (e.g., onlookers participating in gatherings). Additionally, Polish soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary organizations fighting against sabotage were collectively treated as looters – rather than individuals carrying out official duties on the orders of their superiors.\nBy 31 December 1939, the Sondergericht Bromberg had considered 1,005 cases, filing 160 indictments. 147 defendants were convicted: 100 people to death (including 13 women), 10 people to life imprisonment, 23 people to severe imprisonment (totaling 295 years), and 14 people to ordinary imprisonment (totaling 69 years). 21 people were acquitted. The average sentence of severe imprisonment imposed by the special court in Bydgoszcz was 12 years and 8 months, and for \"ordinary\" imprisonment – 4 years and 9 months. For comparison, during the same period, the other six German special courts operating in occupied Poland handed down a total of 56 death sentences. By the end of the war, the Bydgoszcz Special Court in cases related to the \"Bloody Sunday\" events sentenced 243 people to death (including one of German nationality). As a result, the Sondergericht Bromberg was hailed by the Nazi press as the sharpest weapon against the Polish rabble and Polish murderers (Danziger Vorposten, 1 February 1940).\n\n\n== Extermination of the \"Polish leadership class\" ==\n\nWhile in the early days of the occupation, reprisals often had a random nature, in the following weeks, they were targeted at specific professional groups (such as teachers, Catholic clergy), social environments, and members of organizations and associations promoting Polish identity (such as the Polish Western Union, Maritime and Colonial League, or the Insurgents and Veterans Association). Arrests were carried out according to the established mechanism of \"cleansing actions\" that had been used in the initial days of the occupation. On 14 October 1939, a raid was organized against Polish teachers, during which 186 educators were arrested. On the night of October 18–19, a raid was conducted against members of the Polish Western Union, resulting in the arrest of 91 individuals (including 21 women). On October 20, the Germans conducted a large-scale roundup in the vicinity of Kujawska Street. Nearly 1,200 people were temporarily arrested at that time. After interrogations, 27 individuals were identified whose names appeared on proscription lists, police files, or were reported by Volksdeutsche. In November, arrests of Catholic priests began. A large-scale \"pacification action\" (Befriedungsaktion) was also carried out on November 11, the Polish Independence Day. This operation involved 115 groups consisting of Gestapo, Kripo, Schutzpolizei officers, and members of Selbstschutz. Nearly 3,800 people were detained during this operation. This was the last major roundup organized by the Germans in Bydgoszcz.\nMost of the Poles and Jews detained during these raids were taken to the Bydgoszcz Internierungslager. There, the fate of the detainees was decided by a special commission operating in the camp, initially composed of Einsatzgruppe IV officers. After several weeks, Einsatzgruppe IV left the city, and a branch of the so-called Einsatzkommando 16, established in Gdańsk, was introduced to Bydgoszcz. The 20-member group of Gdańsk Schutzstaffel men was led by criminal counselor (Kriminalrat) Jakob Lölgen. His office collaborated with a small Sicherheitsdienst unit led by SS-Sturmbannführer Dr. Rudolf Oebsger-Röder, also part of Einsatzkommando 16. Lölgen's commission decided which prisoners should be released or deported to the General Government, which should be sent to concentration camps, and which should be executed on the spot. Often, German women would also appear in the camp to select individuals for execution. This \"procedure\" involved pointing out a prisoner and stating that they had participated in the \"Bloody Sunday\" in Bydgoszcz.\nThose sentenced to death were executed without trial in remote locations near Bydgoszcz, such as the Gdańsk Forest, forests near Tryszczyn, Borówno, and Otorowo, or primarily, the \"Valley of Death\" in Fordon. The choice of execution sites was determined by factors such as ease of access, short distance from the city, and terrain. The murders were typically carried out by members of the Selbstschutz. Only volunteers were included in the execution squads. Many of the victims were listed in the Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen – a list of individuals earmarked for execution prepared before the war by the central leadership of Nazi Germany. The overall supervision of the extermination operation was overseen by the commander of the Pomeranian Selbstschutz, SS-Oberführer Ludolf von Alvensleben, who resided in Bydgoszcz.\nThe criminal activities of the Selbstschutz and Einsatzgruppen were actively supported by Werner Kampe, the head of the district Nazi Party organization and the lord mayor of Bydgoszcz. Julius Hoppenrath, the chief president of the Gdańsk revenue administration, wrote in 1955 that particularly active in this field was the then head of the district party organization Kampe. Polish intelligentsia paid for his activities with their lives. The Kreisleiter repeatedly ordered the Gestapo in Bydgoszcz to liquidate entire families deemed particularly \"dangerous\" for various reasons. Kampe and his associates ruthlessly looted the homes of arrested or expelled Poles, or occupied them for their own use. It often happened that when the rightful owners tried to reclaim their property, Kampe instructed the Gestapo to eliminate them.\nHigh-ranking officials of Nazi Germany took a keen interest in the proceedings with the population of Bydgoszcz. On 20 September 1939, Bydgoszcz was visited by the Reichsführer-SS, Heinrich Himmler. During his stay in the city, he listened to a \"model trial before the summary court\" and later participated in an execution conducted 10 kilometers from Bydgoszcz, personally directed by the commander of the Bydgoszcz Selbstschutz, SS-Sturmbannführer Josef Meier (known as \"Bloody Meier\" or \"Meier the Elephant\"). Albert Forster, the Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter in the Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia district, also personally visited the Bydgoszcz Internierungslager. The aforementioned Hoppenrath wrote that Forster also contributed to the retaliatory actions taken, especially in Bydgoszcz, with his speeches... Kampe's anti-Polish actions at the time were at least known to the gauleiter, if not suggested and accepted by him. The internment camp was also visited by Robert Ley (head of the German Labour Front) and Wilhelm Frick (Minister of the Interior of the Reich).\n\n\n=== Executions in the forests of Tryszczyn ===\nInitially, the mass executions by the Germans were carried out in the forests near Tryszczyn, north of Bydgoszcz. Around the end of September and beginning of October 1939, approximately 900 people were shot in firing ditches along the Brda river. Three or even four times a day, trucks brought in more groups of convicts from Bydgoszcz, usually numbering around fifty to seventy people each. The victims were ordered to enter the trenches and lie down on the ground, in rows of five or six people, before being shot in the back of the head. After the final execution, the perpetrators organized a celebration at a nearby forester's lodge, which they called the \"highwaymen's party\".\nAmong those murdered in Tryszczyn were the majority of the 370 Jews imprisoned in the barracks of the 15th Light Artillery Regiment (mostly from Dobrzyń nad Drwęcą); about 70 Polish Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts; as well as many women, elderly individuals, and even 12-year-old children. Recovered shells and bullets from French-made weapons indicate that the killings were carried out by members of the Bydgoszcz Selbstschutz (Selbstschutzmen typically used captured weapons).\nThere is an account of one of the executions, conducted in the early days of October 1939. Around 100 prisoners from the camp in the barracks of the 15th Light Artillery Regiment (Poles and Jews) were transported to the forests of Tryszczyn in two trucks. The prisoners had to make the final journey lying down to avoid being noticed by the local population. They were then led in groups of 15 people to the firing ditches, where they were shot.\n\n\n=== Fordon \"Valley of Death\" ===\n\nDue to the overcrowding of mass graves prepared in Tryszczyn and Borówno, the Germans began to search for a new location where they could conduct collective executions. Their choice fell on a valley located about 12 kilometers northeast of Bydgoszcz, near Fordon – which was then an independent city (now a district of Bydgoszcz). This location was chosen primarily because of its distance from human habitation. The narrow and winding valley, situated between the second and third hills of the Miedzyńskie Hills, henceforth gained the name \"Valley of Death\". In early October 1939, even before the start of mass executions, a unit of the German Arbeitsdienst (Labour Service) arrived there and began digging long, 2.5-meter deep trenches. The work lasted for several days.\nThe first execution of people of Bydgoszcz took place in the \"Valley of Death\" on 10 October 1939. The extermination action continued there until November 11, and according to some sources, until 26 November 1939. Victims were brought to the execution site by trucks, most often from places of imprisonment such as the Bydgoszcz Internierungslager. After being stripped of their outer clothing and valuables, the convicts were shot in the back of the head or, less frequently, by machine gun fire. The wounded were finished off with shots from pistols, rifle butts, or sometimes simply buried alive. The execution squads consisted primarily of members of the Bydgoszcz Selbstschutz (led by SS-Sturmbannführers Spaarmann and Meier) and Fordon (the latter commanded by Friedrich Walther Gassmann), as well as Schutzstaffel men from the Bydgoszcz branch of Einsatzkommando 16.\nHistorians are unable to determine how many Poles and Jews were shot in the \"Valley of Death\", largely due to the lack of documented sources of the Fordon massacre. Depending on the sources, estimates range from 2,000 to 3,000 victims. During an exhumation conducted in 1947, the remains of 306 victims were found. However, it is estimated that the \"Valley of Death\" still holds between 700 to 1,600 undiscovered bodies. Therefore, the most probable number of victims of the Fordon massacre is between 1,200 and 1,400 people.\nIt is estimated that as a result of the executions carried out in the \"Valley of Death\", 48% of Bydgoszcz high school teachers, about 33% of clergy, 15% of elementary school teachers, and nearly 14% of doctors and lawyers were killed. On 11 November 1939, the pre-war mayor of Bydgoszcz, Leon Barciszewski, was also killed there, along with his son. The Fordon \"Valley of Death\" is the largest mass grave in Bydgoszcz and also serves as a symbol of the martyrdom of the city's inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Other execution sites ===\nThe secret executions of Bydgoszcz residents were also carried out by the occupiers in other remote locations near the city:\n\nIn the Gdańsk Forest, among others, the aforementioned officials of the Bydgoszcz city administration were shot, deceitfully lured by Kampe to a supposed meeting, as well as numerous prisoners brought from the Gestapo headquarters on Poniatowski Street or from the Selbstschutz detention center in the former Polish Club. An exhumation conducted in the Gdańsk Forest in September 1947 led to the discovery of 84 bodies buried in three mass graves.\nIn Otorowo near Vistula river, members of Einsatzkommando 16 executed several hundred people in October and November 1939. Among the murdered were residents of Bydgoszcz and nearby villages such as Wudzyn, Otorowo, Osielsko, Stronno, and Żołędowo. The victims' bodies were burned in 1944 as part of efforts to cover up the crime. After the war, the names of only 33 victims were identified.\nIt is likely that residents of Bydgoszcz were also murdered near Lake Borówno (in the Nekla village in the Gmina Dobrcz). Executions were carried out along trenches dug on both sides of a dirt road connecting the Bydgoszcz–Gdańsk road section with the southern end of the lake. In the autumn of 1939, the Germans shot about 800 Poles there (estimated data) – mostly residents of the Świecie County. In June 1944, the bodies from most of the graves were dug up and burned as part of efforts to cover up the crime. During the exhumation conducted in October 1945, the remains of 102 people were found. Among the murdered were mostly young people, and a number of women were also recognized.\n\n\n== The beginning of the Germanization campaign ==\n\nAlmost immediately after the occupation of Bydgoszcz began, the German authorities initiated a series of actions aimed at the complete Germanization of the city and making Poles aware that they would now constitute a lower social class – subordinate to Germans and destined solely for physical labor. The driving force behind these actions was especially Kreisleiter Kampe, who during a meeting for Volksdeutsche on 1 October 1939, publicly addressed the Bydgoszcz Germans with the words we are here to command, and the Poles to listen, and announced that any attempts at resistance by Poles would be crushed immediately. In a similar spirit, Gauleiter Albert Forster spoke during a rally on October 11, when he first announced mass deportations of Poles.\nAlready on 14 September 1939, Kampe organized the first registration of Volksdeutsche in Bydgoszcz. Another, much more thorough census, was conducted in November. At the same time, the Bydgoszcz Arbeitsamt (Labour Office) began registering people capable of work, with the aim of identifying Poles from Galicia or the former Congress Poland who had settled in Bydgoszcz after 1918. These people were primarily earmarked for deportation (alongside Jews and families of victims of the Intelligenzaktion). Initially, attempts were made to persuade the \"Congressists\" to leave the city through persuasion or indirect harassment (such as banning them from using various health and social facilities). Refugees who tried to return to Bydgoszcz after the end of the war but could not prove purely Bydgoszcz roots were not allowed to return to their homes. Later, forced deportations began. The first transport of expelled \"Congressists\", numbering 476 people, was sent to the General Government on October 27. Another 550 residents of Bydgoszcz were deported to central Poland on November 4. The property of expelled Poles was confiscated and made available to the so-called Entschädigungsstelle Bromberg (Compensation Office Bydgoszcz), organized by Kampe. The task of the office was to pay compensation to Volksdeutsche who were allegedly harmed by Poles – especially during the events of the \"Bloody Sunday\". In practice, there were so many abuses that the German prosecutor's office became interested, and Gauleiter Forster was forced to remove Kampe from the position of mayor of Bydgoszcz and transfer him to Gdańsk (February 1941).\nAdditionally, other actions were taken aimed at giving Bydgoszcz a purely German character. On 11 September 1939, owners of shops, restaurants, and craft workshops were prohibited from displaying Polish-language signs in public view (violation of the ban carried a fine of 1,000 RM). Kampe attempted Germanization and complete reconstruction of the downtown district, preceded by confiscations of Polish-owned shops and restaurants located there in 1939. Throughout the city, Germans also took over pharmacies and medical offices belonging to Poles. In December 1939, the synagogue on Jana Kazimierza Street in Bydgoszcz was demolished. Polish monuments were also destroyed. For instance, on September 26, Germans removed the monument of Henryk Sienkiewicz from Jan Kochanowski Park, as well as the tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the Greater Poland Uprising from Bernardyńska Street.\nThe Polish population of Bydgoszcz also faced a wave of minor harassments. In October 1939, shops and offices were ordered to serve Germans first, and queuing in front of shops was prohibited (effectively targeting only Poles). In the same month, Poles were ordered to remove radio antennas from their homes. They were also subjected to forced labor, especially unemployed intellectuals. At the end of October 1939, Kampe organized a disciplinary labor camp for Polish youth in barracks on Dwernickiego Street. Only Poles born within the borders of the German Empire found themselves in a slightly better situation. They were allowed, among other things, to join the German Labour Front, and their children were allowed to attend elementary schools.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nAt the end of November 1939, German terror noticeably abated. Mass executions and roundups were replaced by indirect extermination, with the leading role falling to the German police and judiciary. The Nazis' goal of eliminating the \"Polish leadership class\" and pacifying the city was essentially achieved. In a situational report dated 17 November 1939, criminal adviser Lölgen reported that there is no longer any Polish intelligentsia in Bydgoszcz that could act actively. A month later, the German authorities announced that Bydgoszcz was a \"Jew-free city\" (German: Judenfrei).\nThe issue of the human toll suffered by the population of Bydgoszcz as a result of German repression remains controversial to this day. In 1945, Józef Kołodziejczyk estimated the number of war victims in Bydgoszcz at 36,350 people – nearly one-fourth of the city's pre-war population. This figure was accepted by the communist-era historiography as definitive and became deeply rooted in the public consciousness for decades. It is now known that Kołodziejczyk's estimates were significantly inflated. The authors of the 2004 History of Bydgoszcz assessed that approximately 10,000 residents of Bydgoszcz perished between 1939 and 1945, representing all nationalities residing in the city (7% of the pre-war population). The number of Bydgoszcz residents of Polish origin who died as a result of the indirect and direct extermination carried out by the German occupiers during the 5 years of war is estimated at 5,300.\nIt is not possible to accurately determine the number of Bydgoszcz residents murdered during the first four months of the occupation. Official German documents from 1939 estimated the number of \"liquidated\" Poles and Jews at around 900 (including 100 sentenced to death by the Sondergericht Bromberg), but these figures did not account for the victims of secret executions in Tryszczyn, the \"Valley of Death\", and other locations. Dieter Schenk, relying on findings from the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in Ludwigsburg, estimated that nearly 5,000 residents of Bydgoszcz and the Bydgoszcz County were murdered by the end of 1939 as part of the \"anti-intelligentsia action\". The authors of the History of Bydgoszcz estimated the number of city residents murdered in 1939 at around 1,500–1,900. Wiesław Trzeciakowski, in his work titled Lists of Victims in Bydgoszcz 1939–1945 (Bydgoszcz 2010), managed to establish the names of 900 victims. The same author, in Death in Bydgoszcz 1939–1945 (Bydgoszcz 2011, expanded edition 2012 and 2013), provided 1,500 names along with the circumstances of their deaths (efforts to determine the number of victims are still ongoing). In Tryszczyn, the \"Valley of Death\", and Otorowo, residents of other towns were also killed – such as the mentioned Jews from Dobrzyń nad Drwęcą. Precisely determining the number of victims of German executions is also difficult due to the action of covering up traces of crimes carried out by the Germans in the final months of the occupation, as well as the fact that post-war exhumations were conducted hastily and carelessly (including the unexpectedly interrupted exhumation work in the \"Valley of Death\" by the Ministry of Public Security). Therefore, the aforementioned numbers must be treated as approximate.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\n\nAfter the end of the war, Polish authorities began investigating the traces of German crimes committed in Bydgoszcz and surrounding areas. From April 28 to May 2, 1947, exhumation work was conducted in the \"Valley of Death\" near Fordon. During this process, the remains of 306 victims were found, of whom only 39 individuals were identified (identification was difficult because the victims were stripped of all personal belongings). The recovered remains were solemnly buried at the Cemetery of Bydgoszcz Heroes on Freedom Hill. In September of the same year, the bodies of 84 Poles murdered in the Gdańsk Forest were also exhumed.\nOn 4 May 1948, 128 coffins containing the exhumed remains of 693 people murdered by Germans in Tryszczyn were displayed in the Old Market Square in Bydgoszcz. Subsequently, the coffins were ceremoniously transported and buried at the Cemetery of Bydgoszcz Heroes on Freedom Hill. This was the last major funeral for victims of the Hitlerite occupation of the city.\nAfter the end of World War II, efforts were also made to commemorate the victims of German crimes. On 5 September 1969, the Monument of Struggle and Martyrdom was unveiled in the Old Market Square in Bydgoszcz. An inscription on one of its plaques reads: The Monument of Struggle and Martyrdom commemorates the memory of Polish citizens from Kuyavia, Pomerania, and Chełmno Land who died and were murdered during World War II in the years 1939–1945. Additionally, on 31 August 1975, a monument dedicated to the residents of Bydgoszcz murdered in this place was unveiled on the hill above the \"Valley of Death\". The monument is surrounded by numerous plaques with the names of individuals who lost their lives there. An inscription on it reads: Fordon's Valley of Death. Place of execution of 1,200 Polish citizens. October 12 – November 11, 1939. Moreover, memorial obelisks and small monuments commemorating the residents of Bydgoszcz murdered by the German occupiers can also be found in other areas of the city – in Jan Kochanowski Park, at the intersection of Kąpielowa and Ludwikowo streets in Jachcice, in the former Fordon market square (now Zwycięstwa Square), in front of the railway directorate building at 63 Dworcowa Street, and at 16 Ugory Street in Szwederowo.\nAfter Pope John Paul II's visit to Bydgoszcz in 1999 and his appeal for the commemoration of the martyrs of our time, the idea of building the \"Way of the Cross – Golgotha of the 20th Century\" station in the \"Valley of Death\" emerged. The first station was dedicated in 2004, and the last one was completed in 2009. The culmination of efforts to highlight this place was the elevation on 7 October 2008, by the bishop of the Bydgoszcz diocese, Bishop Jan Tyrawa, of the nearby church along with the Way of the Cross to the dignity of the \"Sanctuary of the Queen of Martyrs, Calvary of Bydgoszcz – Golgotha of the 20th Century\". The monument from 1975, along with the Stations of the Cross, now constitutes a martyrological complex, which also includes alleys, sculptures, symbolic graves, and commemorative plaques. Every year, patriotic and religious ceremonies, appeals for the fallen, Stations of the Cross, processions, and Passion Plays are held there.\n\n\n== Liability of perpetrators ==\n\nThe majority of perpetrators of crimes committed against the population of Bydgoszcz escaped post-war criminal responsibility. Only a few criminals faced Polish courts. Albert Forster, the Nazi Party Gauleiter and Reich Governor in the Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia district, was sentenced to death by the National Tribunal in Gdańsk in 1948 for crimes committed in Pomerania between 1939 and 1945. The sentence was carried out on 28 February 1952, in Mokotów Prison. Richard Hildebrandt, a senior SS and police leader in the Danzig-West Prussia district, was sentenced to death by a Polish court in Bydgoszcz. The sentence was executed on 10 March 1951. In the same trial, SS-Brigadeführer Max Henze, who served as the president of the police in Bydgoszcz from 12 October 1939, was also sentenced to death. He was hanged on the same day as Hildebrandt. Eryk Pollatz, an active member of the Selbstschutz responsible for, among other things, the massacre of Jews in Fordon, also stood before the Polish judiciary. By the judgment of the Special Criminal Court dated 4 July 1947, Pollatz was sentenced to death. The sentence was executed.\nThe leader of the Pomeranian Selbstschutz, Ludolf von Alvensleben, fled to Argentina after the war. Furthermore, according to Dieter Schenk, the West German judiciary knowingly and willingly allowed many criminals to escape punishment. For example, in 1949, a court in Hamburg refused to extradite General Walther Braemer to Poland, allowing him to enjoy freedom until his death in 1955. Proceedings against the commanders of the Bydgoszcz Selbstschutz – Erich Spaarmann (inspectorate chief) and Josef Meier (commander of district structures, known as \"Bloody Meier\") – were terminated in May 1963. In 1965, the Munich prosecutor's office applied to discontinue the prosecution of former district Nazi Party leader and lord mayor of Bydgoszcz, Werner Kampe, allowing him to continue his business activities as a representative of an insurance company. Proceedings against the commanders of Einsatzgruppe IV – Lothar Beutel and Helmut Bischoff – were also terminated due to lack of evidence of guilt. Dr. Rudolf Oebsger-Röder from the Bydgoszcz Sicherheitsdienst served after the war as the head of the Federal Intelligence Service in Jakarta and worked as a spokesman for the house and court of Indonesian dictator Suharto.\nIn 1966, Jakob Lölgen and his deputy, Horst Eichler, stood trial in Munich. The indictment accused them of causing the deaths of 349 people, including 74 teachers, 3 doctors, and the mayor of the city, Leon Barciszewski, in Bydgoszcz's extermination actions in a deceitful and low-minded manner. Both defendants were acquitted by the jury, which found that they acted under the coercion of their superiors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMassacres in Piaśnica\nForest of Szpęgawsk\nStutthof concentration camp\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBartnicki, Jerzy (1985).

        "content": "The Marchese Cesare Lucchesini (2 July 1756 – 16 May 1832) was an Italian statesman and philologist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCesare Lucchesini was born in Lucca, the youngest of three brothers. His older brother Girolamo served as a diplomat for the Kingdom of Prussia.\nIn 1764 he enrolled in the Collegio of San Carlo, also called the Collegio dei Nobili of Modena, where he family had moved to work for the ducal court. In Modena, one of his teachers was Lazzaro Spallanzani. He completed his education at the Collegio Nazareno of Rome. Returning to Lucca in 1776, he fostered an interest in Greek literature. He also learned various eastern languages including Coptic, Syriac, Hebrew, and Arabic.\nIn 1792–1794, in service of the Republic of Lucca, he was appointed to a diplmatic post in Vienna. In 1798, he was sent to Paris to lobby for the Republic, threatened by the French Revolutionary armies. He was able to return to Lucca in 1800, and served in various ministerial positions in Lucca. In 1805, he served in a delegation sent by Lucca to the coronation of Napoleon as King of Italy. He served in various posts in the principality of Lucca under the rule of Elisa Bonaparte. During this period the former Accademia degli Oscuri was converted into the Istituto Napoleone. He easily transitioned to working in the subsequent Duchy of Lucca under the rule of Maria Luisa of Spain. However, as he became elder, he dedicated himself mainly to translations and writings about languages, arts, and chronicles of Lucca.\n\n\n== Selected Works ==\nDell'origine del politeismo in Grecia; Congettura intorno all'alfabeto greco;\nDell'istituzione della vera tragedia greca per opera di Eschilo (Aeschylus), reprinted in the third volume of Lucchesini's Opere.\nSaggio d'osservazioni sopra un'opera recentemente pubblicata col titolo: Feste e cortigiane della Grecia, Lucca, 1806.\nDella lingua italiana e delle altre lingue moderne d'Europa; Delle lingue antiche e delle altre moderne, che si chiamano orientali, Lucca, 1819; Lucca, 1826.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nProietti, Domenico (2006). \"LUCCHESINI, Cesare\".

Negotiations between the ATNM, Mali, and Algeria had been ongoing since September 2007, but Algeria backed out of the negotiations in early 2008 following Libyan mediation. Around this time, Algeria had also been accused of abetting the ATNM in holding Malian hostages on Algerian soil.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nAround 4 or 5 in the morning on May 21, the town of Abeibara was attacked by the ATNM. Several hundred ATNM fighters transported by pick-ups surrounded the town and it's outlying National Guard posts, before opening fire on them from the nearby heights. Malian soldiers in the town responded with heavy weapons. Fighting lasted for ten hours into the afternoon, and the ATNM was eventually pushed back from the city.\nThe Malian Ministry of Defense announced the deaths of fifteen Malian soldiers and injuries of six others, along with the deaths of seventeen ATNM fighters and twenty-five injured. Security sources in Kidal stated that the death toll for the ATNM could be higher due to the severity of some of the injuries. A spokesperson for the ATNM stated that two Malian tabks were destroyed and sixty Malian soldiers were captured, and that one ATNM fighter was killed and two others lightly injured. \n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe United Nations expressed concern and called for a peace process following the battle. The Algerian government also resumed negotiations with Mali and the ATNM following the battle. A number of civilians fled the town following the attacks as well.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rajendralal De (/ˈrɑːdʒɛndrəlɑ/ˈ; born January 3, 1899), was an Indian chemist and physicist. He made significant contributions to the field of chemistry, particularly in the study of rare-earth elements and radiochemistry. In 1937, De claimed to have discovered element 85 in minerals and named it \"dakine.\" However, subsequent investigations revealed that his claim was mistaken. Despite this setback, De's work contributed to the broader scientific efforts to explore and understand the properties of elements. Throughout his career, De held various academic positions, including professorships at institutions such as the University of Calcutta. He was known for his dedication to teaching and mentoring students, inspiring many young minds to pursue careers in science. De's influence extended beyond the classroom, as he actively advocated for the advancement of scientific research and education in India.\nRajendralal De was born on January 3, 1899, in Kolkata, India. He completed his undergraduate studies in Chemistry at Presidency College in Kolkata, where he developed a keen interest in the sciences. He pursued further studies at the University of Calcutta, earning his doctoral degree in Chemistry. His doctoral research focused on the chemistry of rare-earth elements, laying the foundation for his future contributions to the field.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\nhttps://mentalitch.com/the-interesting-discovery-of-astatine/\nhttps://wanttoknowit.com/who-discovered-astatine/\nhttps://episodictable.com/astatine/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-4028\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-tale-of-7-elements-astatine-excerpt/\n\n\n== External links ==",

His father was a circus boxer by profession and he was related to Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman through his mother. During the Blitz, Thomas and his family were evacuated to the Rhymney Valley. He grew up in the village of Fochriw and attended Bargoed Grammar School.An openside flanker, Thomas played most of his rugby with Newport, making 213 appearances during the 1960s. He is best remembered in Newport for his try saving tackle on Bill Davis in the last minute of their 3–0 triumph over the 1963 touring All Blacks. This helped earn him a Wales debut at Cardiff Arms Park against the same opponent and he won a second cap in the 1964 Five Nations Championship against England at Twickenham.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Wales national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlgy Thomas at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "Daibu temple ruins (大分廃寺跡, Daibu Haiji ato) is an archeological site with the ruins of the foundations of a Japanese pagoda from a Nara period Buddhist temple located in the city of Iizuka, Fukuoka, Japan. It was designated as a National Historic Site in 1941.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Daibu temple ruins are located approximately one kilometer east of the Daibu Hachiman-gu, a former shrine of Hakozaki Shrine which was built in 726 AD. The temple was constructed in the early 8th century, and was on a large scale; however, it does not appear in any historical records, and the name and history of the temple are completely unknown. It is located along the ancient road linking Hakata Port with the Tagawa region of Buzen Province. The ruins of the pagoda foundations have been known for a long time and are in almost perfect condition, making this a valuable temple site from the early Nara period. The pagoda foundation is a platform that is about one meter higher than the surrounding area, and there are 17 cornerstones centered on the core. From the spacing of holes, it is estimated that the pagoda was a three-story pagoda over 30 meters in height. The large core foundation that supported the central pillar of the pagoda has a posthole with a diameter of approximately 80-cm, and has two grooves facing outward, which may have prevented water from accumulating. Subsequent archaeological excavations revealed that the temple area was estimated to be approximately 94 meters north-to-south and approximately 102 meters east-to-west. Traces of the Main Hall have been found to the left of the pagoda, indicating that the temple layout may have been patterned after Hokki-ji in Ikaruga, Nara. In addition, Silla-style and Baekje-style roof tiles with lotus patterns were excavated.The site is approximately a 15-minutes walk from Chikuzen-Daibu Station on the JR Kyushu Sasaguri Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIizuka city home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

Founded in 2022, it is the air cargo transportation arm of Braspress Transportes Urgentes, one of the largest road transport companies in Brazil and Latin America. \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nThe process of creating Braspress Air Cargo began on December 23, 2022, with the issuance of National Registry of Legal Entities (CNPJ) with the Special Department of Federal Revenue of Brazil, popularly known as Receita Federal (RFB). At the same time, the new airline began its approval process with the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC) to obtain its air operator certificate (AOC).\nThe new airline was founded by Urubatan Helou, CEO of Braspress Transportes Urgentes and his partner, Milton Domingues Petri. Together, on July 1, 1977, they created Braspress, today one of the largest road transport companies in Latin America, with a presence in Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina, which has its own fleet of 3,090 trucks, 117 distribution centers, 9 thousand direct employees and 4 thousand outsourced workers.\nIn September 2023, it reserved aeronautical registrations through the Brazilian Aeronautical Registry (RAB) system for its first three aircraft, all of them of the Boeing 737-400BDSF. In January 2024, the first plane, registration PS-BPA (MSN 29206), was registered in a painting hangar in Woensdrecht, in the Netherlands, already wearing the traditional blue and orange colors of the Brazilian carrier, similar to the paint used on the vehicle fleet.\nOn March 3, 2024, the second Braspress Air Cargo plane, registration PS-BPB (MSN 29207), was officially delivered by the lessor World Star Aviation (WSA) and subsequently ferried between Liège, in Belgium, and São José dos Campos, in Brazil, to be prepared for its new operator at DIGEX MRO, where it will receive the airline's colors. The same plane will be used on certification flights, the last pending step before obtaining the air operator certificate.  \nOn April 3, 2024, Braspress and Concessionária Aeroportos Brasil Viracopos, administrator of Viracopos International Airport, in Campinas, signed an area transfer agreement that allows the airline to begin installing the necessary infrastructure to begin its operations in the airport in the coming months. Braspress Air Cargo is expected to make its first flight in August, connecting Campinas/Viracopos with Eduardo Gomes International Airport, in Manaus.\n\n\n== Fleet ==\nAs of April 2024, the Braspress Air Cargo fleet consists of the following aircraft:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of airlines of Brazil\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "The Falmouth Hotel was a six-story, 240-room hotel in Portland, Maine. It stood on Middle Street, between a now-demolished Plum Street and the extant Union Street, from 1868 to 1963, when it was torn down for being a fire hazard. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and Warren G. Harding all stayed at the hotel, while United States Army General William Sherman visited the hotel in 1898. Due to its regular hosting of functions, the hotel became known as the \"hotel of a million banquets.\" Plum Street connected Fore Street and Middle Street between Exchange Street and Union Street.The hotel, which was the largest in Maine at the time of its completion, was built by John Bundy Brown, at a cost of $300,000, as a symbol of Portland's resurgence after its great fire of 1866. Designed by New York's Charles Alexander, the hotel featured a granite facade, a black walnut interior and marble fireplaces. One of its early proprietors was L. Stevens. He was followed by E. A. Gilson, formerly of the St. Nicholas Hotel in New York City, who was in the role after the hotel's first renovation, completed in 1882. Maurice, Baker & Co. pharmacists had a store on the hotel's ground floor in 1888. The ground floor also became the home of the headquarters of the Maine Automobile Association and the Maine Republican Party.\nAfter another renovation, it reopened as the New Falmouth Hotel in August 1898, when F. H. Nunns was its proprietor. In 1902, Nunns stated to The Hotel Monthly that the hotel was the first to use a card register. The process had a slow uptake because certain states were required by law to maintain a book of guests' names \"for police or other regulation.\"In the early 20th century, National Liberty Insurance Company of America had on office on the hotel's ground floor. Its agent was Frank R. Kugler (1877–1959). In 1913, the hotel's proprietor was J. J. Pooler, while in 1928 it was Harry Bridges.In 1920, Carleton Glidden (1874–1924) purchased the hotel. He had been the manager of the nearby Congress Square Hotel.By the late 1950s, the hotel's popularity had waned. It closed in early November 1958, and was purchased by the City of Portland in 1963, shortly after which it was demolished. It was replaced by today's Canal Bank Plaza in 1971.The Tichnor Brothers printed a postcard of the hotel around 1938.\n\n\n== References in popular culture ==\nChristopher Hyde mentions the hotel's cocktail lounge in his 2005 book The House of Special Purpose.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The town of Höchst am Main, now the Höchst district of Frankfurt, has a history stretching back over twelve hundred years. For a long time, Höchst was an independent town and an outpost of the Kurmainz region at the gates of Frankfurt. It was not incorporated into Frankfurt until 1928.\n\n\n== Geographical classification ==\n\nHöchst was built at the crossroads of prehistoric transportation routes. Immediately after the Nidda flows into the Main, two navigable rivers at the time, a slope edge pushes almost right up to the riverbank. The plateau is flood-proof and was easy to defend. At the foot of the slope, a ford led through the Main, while a pre-Roman old road, the Antsanvia or Hohe Straße, a forerunner of the later Elisabethenstraße, led from the mouth of the Main near Kastel via Höchst to the Vogelsberg. Starting from the mouth of the Niddam, the Lindenweg (also known as the Linienweg), a pre-Roman, straightforward connection over the Taunus crossing at today's Saalburg, led into the Lahn region. North of Sossenheim, the old trade route, the Hessian Wine Route (Wagenstraße), branched off into the Wetterau.\n\n\n== Pre- and early history ==\nIndividual finds of tools and worked pieces of antler from the end of the Upper Palaeolithic in the area of the old town of Höchst suggest that the area of Höchst was already occasionally inhabited by people at this time. However, there is no evidence of a permanent settlement.\nIt was not until the beginning of the Neolithic period that a permanent human settlement in the area of the Old Town, Höchster Neustadt and Oberfeld can be established. Remains of settlements and pottery shards from the Linear Pottery and Bell Beaker cultures were found during construction work and excavations.\nBurial mounds and urn fields from the Bronze Age provide evidence of ongoing human settlement in the Höchster area. Iron Age graves from the Hallstatt and La Tène periods were also found during construction work, indicating Celtic inhabitants. However, there is no evidence of an oppidum, just as there is no evidence of a fixed settlement structure in the sense of a village.\n\n\n== Roman and pre-Franconian period ==\nShortly after the turn of the millennium, the Romans built a fort on the high bank above the Main. There is no exact proof, but it is possible that a bridge spanned the shallow Main at the Wörthspitze near the mouth of the Niddam and connected the Roman settlement with the southern Main areas around the present-day towns of Kelsterbach and Groß-Gerau.\nThe Romans extended existing Celtic roads and created numerous new connections: The Lindenweg or Linienweg to Saalburg or the Taunus crossing there, the Weinstrasse via this after the Elisabethenstrasse crossing to Wetterau, the Hohe Strasse on the Main / Nidda watershed to Vogelsberg and Thuringia. The Königsteiner Straße still runs in a north-westerly direction to the Feldberg, and the route along the course of the Main can be found after the Nidda bridge as a connection via Griesheim and the Gutleuthof to Frankfurt. Today, these are Nieder Kirchweg and Stroofstraße.\nA river port was established at the protected mouth of the Nidda, and a military brickworks was built on the northern bank of the Nidda in what is now Nieder Gemarkung. Legio XXII Primigenia produced bricks here between the years 85 and 120. With the further construction of the Limes in the middle of the 2nd century, brick production, which had been temporarily discontinued, was resumed. More than 200 different brick stamps have been preserved, most of them from the XXII legion.\nThe settlement lost its economic and military importance with the construction of the Elisabethenstraße via Hofheim and the construction of the Limes. It developed into a civilian settlement. When the Alamanni overcame the Limes from 260 onwards and invaded Roman territory, the Romans retreated to their territories on the left bank of the Rhine and gave up their possessions on the right bank. The settlement at the mouth of the Niddam became deserted, and there are no records or reports of the Höchster area being repopulated after the Romans withdrew. Only a few indications point to an Alemannic farmstead in the 4th century and a Merovingian royal court on the edge of today's old town in the 5th century.\n\n\n== Under the crosier: The Mainz period - 790 to 1803 ==\n\n\n=== The village of Höchst in the early and high Middle Ages ===\n\nIt was not until the 8th century that there is evidence of a settlement of farmsteads on the high plateau above the Nidda. However, there can be no talk of a village in the modern sense; it was rather a loose collection of individual farmsteads. The first documented mention of this settlement was on August 5, 790 in the Lorsch Codex, when the Frankish lord of the manor Thiotmann donated an estate in villa hostat in Nitahgowe, in the \"village on the high site in the Niddagau\", to Lorsch Monastery. In later times, the Renaissance poet Georg Calaminus wrote down the Hostato legend in verse, according to which the squire Hostato was the only one to survive the Battle of Roncesvalles and was therefore knighted by Charlemagne as thanks for his bravery and appointed bailiff of the high place.\nBy the early 9th century at the latest, the Archbishopric of Mainz, which was striving to expand its territorial rule, had amassed so many individual privileges under Frankish law in the areas along the Main from Mainz to Frankfurt that Höchst was part of the Mainz possessions and no longer belonged to the Niddagau. Annals of the Fulda monastery from the year 849 report on the \"Höchst estate in the Mainz region\". The rule of Mainz lasted for almost a thousand years until 1803, and the Mainz wheel in the Höchst coat of arms is still a reminder of this today.\nFrom around 830, Archbishop Otgar of Mainz had St. Justin's Church built on the high bank above the River Main, which is still largely intact today. It is one of the oldest churches in Germany and the oldest building in Frankfurt. The church, which was far too large for the settlement, was a symbol of power for the Archbishop of Mainz vis-à-vis the Frankfurt royal court. At the same time, as part of the church's settlement policy, it served to promote the development of a village settlement and concentration of the population, who had previously lived in scattered individual farmsteads, around the church. Otgar's successor Rabanus Maurus consecrated the building after its completion in 850. The Justinus Church served as the village church. Subsequently, the village of Höchst developed along the main road between a Mainz Fronhof in the west, which was located in the area of the Wed, and the Justinuskirche in the east. The western border of Höchst is formed by a branch of the Liederbach, which flowed to the Main via the area of today's Schloßplatz. At the beginning of the 11th century, it was possible to speak of a village of Höchst.\nThe development of another archiepiscopal court to the west of Justinuskirche has been recorded from the 11th century. Together with St. Justin's Church, it was donated to St. Alban's Monastery in Mainz. The church was specifically described in the monastery's writings as being in danger of collapsing; in this way, St. Alban's received further land and privileges in Höchst as a gift. However, no renovation work was carried out on the supposedly dilapidated church. The Höchst branch of St. Alban's Abbey remained in Höchst until 1419.\nIn the 12th century, the diocese of Mainz appointed a burgrave in Höchst; Count Gotfried von der Wartburg, a relative of Archbishop Henry I, is mentioned in documents. Such a governor usually had his seat in a town or castle. Höchst was not yet a town at this time, so it can be concluded from the proven existence of a bailiff that a castle already existed in the middle of the 12th century as the predecessor of today's Höchst Castle. During excavation work on the castle terrace in 1981, trenches were found which, due to their different orientation, could not have belonged to the - proven - later Gothic customs castle.\nThe Mainz toll levied in Höchst and other towns on the Lower Main was abolished and banned by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1157. Only three places, Frankfurt, Aschaffenburg and Neustadt, were still allowed to collect river customs duties. With the decline of imperial power in the 13th century, the Electorate of Mainz was once again able to levy customs duties in Höchst. A new and larger castle was built, which had a high, almost five meter thick shield wall on the land side. The result of the castle construction was a modest expansion of Höchst to the west. When the moat was excavated, the deeply cut mouth of the Liederbach was filled in, the castle square was largely raised to its present level and the water was channelled directly into the moat.\nNew buildings were constructed to the north and east of the castle square between the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century. The Allmeygang, which had previously led directly to the Main, was diverted to the new square. To the west of the castle stood the Ochsenturm as a free-standing watchtower, which was later incorporated into the town fortifications built in the 15th century.\n\n\n=== Town elevation and urban development in the late Middle Ages ===\n\nThe elevation of Höchst was a point of contention between Mainz and Frankfurt for a long time. The main issue was the levying of the Mainz toll by the archbishops of Mainz, for whom the toll was an important source of income. Frankfurt, on the other hand, regarded the Mainz customs duty at Höchst as an obstacle to trade and repeatedly obtained its prohibition by the emperor. Nevertheless, the people of Mainz often continued to levy the Mainz tolls without bothering about the bans. During the interregnum with its weakened royal power, this usually had no consequences. In 1336, Emperor Ludwig IV of Bavaria granted Frankfurt a privilege that forbade the construction of any fortifications within a seven-mile radius of Frankfurt. This was intended to prevent Höchst from being fortified.\nOn February 11, 1355, Emperor Charles IV granted the village of Hoisten (Höchst) city rights against Frankfurt's will in a document issued in Pisa. The document, written in Latin, was addressed to Gerlach von Nassau, the sovereign and Archbishop of Mainz. For a long time, there were doubts about the legality of this document, as it was allegedly neither sealed nor signed. However, the document kept in the Bavarian Main State Archives in Munich bears both the royal and imperial seal and is therefore valid.\nIn another document issued in German in Nuremberg on January 12, 1356, which is also kept in the Bavarian Main State Archives in Munich, Charles IV reaffirmed the elevation of the city:\n\nWe grant and allow him by our special imperial grace, his descendants, [...] that they shall and may erect a town out of their village Hoesten, and build and make it, and fortify and arm it with moats, gates, towers and all other things and with all roads, ...\nCharles also significantly extended Höchst's city rights and granted the young city market rights. As in the first charter, the city was granted privileges of freedom along the lines of the neighboring city of Frankfurt:\n\nThey shall also celebrate and hold a weekly market in the above-mentioned city every Tuesday, and the above-mentioned city shall have and make full use of all the rights and freedoms, grace and good customs on the same market day and in all other ways and matters, as our and the above-mentioned kingdom's city of Franckenfurt has and uses and has done from time immemorial.\nAs Mainz's daughter city at the gates of Frankfurt, Höchst thus became an important instrument for Mainz in the competition between the two major cities. At the same time, the Archbishops of Mainz were appointed as Chancellors of Germany under the Golden Bull and had the privilege of assembling the electors to elect a king.\n\nThe granting of the city charter strengthened Mainz's rights on the Lower Main against the up-and-coming imperial city of Frankfurt, and the right to fortify also gave Mainz a stronger military presence in Höchst. The previously unprotected settlement and the Mainz Fronhof were now better protected against raids. Thanks to the city fortifications, the Frankfurt-Mainz trade route ran through the protected city area, which meant that land customs duties could also be levied. The revenue from the customs duties in Höchst, Ehrenfels and Niederlahnstein was a welcome instrument for the financially weak Mainz state to share in the growing wealth of its neighbors.\n\nStrengthening the bourgeoisie with the elevation of Höchst was not in the interests of the archbishop, who had already had to grant the citizens of Mainz considerable freedoms. The citizens of Höchst were granted municipal freedoms by the elevation of the city, but no self-government. Mainz did not set up a council and the mayor was also appointed by the archbishops. The town of Höchst was to provide customs revenue and secure the eastern border of the Mainz state militarily. Peasant serfdom was replaced by other duties such as guard duty on the town walls.\nShortly after the town was raised, the construction of a town fortification began in Höchst. The town wall, which has been partially preserved to this day, was probably built in several stages. The Limburg Chronicle does not mention a stone wall in the report on the Frankfurt attack of 1396, but rather palisades with ditches and towers:\n\nIt should also be known that Höchst was only established as a small town and freedom forty years ago, with a moat, planks and keeps, as is proper.\nInitially, the town extended from Rosengasse in the west to the later Kronberger Haus in the east. Only at the end of the 15th century, after two extensions, did it reach the extent of the existing city wall in the east and west.\nThe customs duty levied by the Mainzer in Höchst on all ships sailing on the Main remained a point of contention between the Mainzer and the Frankfurters, as the trading city of Frankfurt saw its most important lifeline threatened by the Mainz toll. In 1368, the customs duty was raised again, banned once more in 1379 and the Main was declared duty-free as far as Frankfurt. In 1380, King Wenceslas finally allowed Archbishop Adolf I of Nassau and his successors to levy a duty on wine and other merchant goods. In 1396, the people of Frankfurt therefore took advantage of the vacancy of the Mainz bishop's see; on behalf of the Frankfurt council, the Cronberg knights destroyed the town and Höchst Castle in a coup d'état. Between 1396 and 1432, the castle and town fortifications were rebuilt step by step, against which Frankfurt sued in vain. The interplay between permission and prohibition, collection and renunciation of the Höchst customs duty also continued.\nThe settlement of several noble families in Höchst, who alternately occupied the post of Mainz bailiff, led to spatial and economic growth. After its destruction in 1396, the town was extended in both directions along the main street until 1432. In the west, the older Ochsenturm tower was incorporated into the new fortifications as the south-western corner. Town gates were built along the main street.\nThe monastery of St. Alban, which had previously provided pastoral care in the Justinuskirche, was dissolved in 1419. The monastery property was therefore transferred to the Antonite Order in 1441, which moved its monastery in Roßdorf near Hanau to Höchst. The Antonite monks added a Gothic choir to the Justinuskirche, which still characterizes the appearance of the building today. The last Antonites left Höchst in 1803 after secularization.\nIn 1463, Diether von Isenburg, who was defeated in the Mainz Collegiate Feud and deposed as Archbishop, was granted the office of Höchst as his own dominion in the Peace of Zeilsheim. Until Diether became archbishop again in 1475, he had the castle and town of Höchst expanded. In a further construction phase from 1460 to 1475, the town was once again expanded to the east; the widening of the street in front of the Frankfurter Tor, known as the Storch, served as a new square for the Höchst weekly market. During this expansion, the fortified Mainmühle was incorporated into the fortifications as a new south-eastern corner.\n\n\n=== Höchst in the early modern period until the end of the Electorate of Mainz ===\n\nDuring the Renaissance period, Höchst slowly developed into a small-town sub-center to the west of Frankfurt. From the middle of the 16th century, some of the aristocratic residences that still exist today were built, such as the Kronberger Haus, the Dalberger Haus and the Greiffenclausche Haus. As archbishop and sovereign, Wolfgang von Dalberg had the palace further extended from 1586.\nHöchst was struck by the plague in 1582. The number of plague deaths is not recorded, only the Antonite diary reports four victims among the friars. On the night of December 10/11, half of the town was destroyed in the Great Fire. The Antonite diary records this:\n\n1586 Högst branded in Vigilia Damasi; the Main was frozen for 5 weeks.\nThe Thirty Years' War was also a turning point for Höchst. The town was severely affected by the events of the war. On June 20, 1622, the Battle of Höchst was fought, in which the Imperial forces under Tilly defeated the Brunswickers. The town was occupied and plundered. From November 1631 to March 1632, the Swedes under Gustav II Adolf occupied the city, with a small Swedish garrison remaining until the end of 1634. On his march from Frankfurt towards Mainz, Bernhard von Weimar had Höchst captured in January 1635 and half of the city and the then Gothic castle burnt down. Elector Anselm Casimir Wambolt von Umstadt complained about this to the Emperor in a letter dated March of that year:\n\nBut out of evil intent and poisonous envy, without any benefit or advantage to themselves, they reduced the residential palace built with great cost by our predecessor Wolfgang to ashes, especially down to the walls that were still standing.\nThe town was repeatedly ravaged by enemy troops. Fires, famine and plague decimated the population. Of the 126 families in 1618, only 75 remained at the end of the war. However, the number of households rose again to 102 due to new arrivals. The town was slow to recover from the consequences of the war and the destroyed castle was not rebuilt. Only the gate building and the keep were repaired between 1636 and 1768. The tower was given its baroque dome in 1681.\n\nIn the 18th century, trade slowly began to flourish in Höchst. The population slowly increased with the economic upturn, doubling to 850 by 1780 compared to 450 in 1668. The founding of the famous Höchst porcelain manufactory in 1746 - it produced until 1796 and was re-established in 1947 - and the settlement of the Italian trading family Bolongaro were two important reasons for this upturn. The Bolongaros had acquired a Frankfurt tobacco shop in 1743 and developed it into the largest snuff manufactory in Europe. In 1771, they acquired citizenship in Höchst, which the Lutheran imperial city of Frankfurt had denied them. Elector Emmerich Joseph allowed them to build the Bolongaro Palace as part of his Neustadt project for the urban development of Höchst, which began in 1768. However, progress on the project was slow. Although the new settlers were granted many privileges, the construction costs on the difficult terrain were high and there was plenty of cheap building land available in the old town. As a result, the new town remained undeveloped apart from a few streets.\nOn September 24, 1778, the Old Town was once again hit by a fire that destroyed the north-eastern quarter. As a result, the buildings there were reorganized to reduce the risk of fire. At the same time, the Elector allowed the buildings to be built right up to the city wall. This meant the end of the city wall as a defensive structure for the city. The Bolongaros, who had been granted Frankfurt citizenship after all in 1783, left Höchst again and entrusted their authorized signatory Bertina with the management of the tobacco manufactory.\nIn the following years from 1792, Höchst was occupied several times by French troops during the Coalition Wars. In September 1795, a French army under Marshal Jourdan crossed the Rhine at Mainz-Kastel, but was defeated by the Austrians under Karl von Clerfayt in the Battle of Höchst on October 10, 1795, and thrown back across the Rhine. On October 11, 1802, one hundred men of the Nassau military under the leadership of Government Councillor Huth took possession of Höchst in anticipation of the territorial reorganization.\n\n\n== From Nassau and Prussia to Frankfurt - 1803 to 1928 ==\n\n\n=== The Biedermeier district town in Nassau ===\n\nWith the end of the Holy Roman Empire through the Imperial Deputation of 1803, the ecclesiastical principalities were dissolved - the territory of the Archbishopric of Mainz was also secularized. The town and office of Höchst were assigned to the Principality of Nassau-Usingen, which was absorbed into the Duchy of Nassau in 1806. The residence city responsible for Höchst was now Wiesbaden. A few years later, Höchst was separated from the Archbishopric of Mainz under canon law. As part of the reorganization of the dioceses in 1821, Höchst, together with the Duchy of Nassau and the Free City of Frankfurt, became part of the newly created diocese of Limburg in 1827.\n\nFrom November 1 to 2, 1813, Napoléon Bonaparte, who had been defeated at Leipzig, spent his last night on the right bank of the Rhine. He spent the night in the Bolongaro Palace. His opponent, Marshal Blücher, reached Höchst a few days later, on November 17. He used the Bolongaro Palace as his headquarters until December 27 of that year.\nAfter the end of the Wars of Liberation in 1813, the Nassau government began to improve the infrastructure and reform the administration of the duchy. Höchst became the administrative seat of the Höchst district in 1816. As part of the expansion of the Mainzer Landstraße, the obstructive and useless city walls and both city gates were demolished in 1816 and the main street was extended. Only the Main front of the old town fortifications remained, as there was no room for the town to expand. It still characterizes Höchst's image on the Main side today. Königsteiner Straße, which was created as part of the new town project, was extended between 1814 and 1820 as a road towards Königstein. Höchst experienced further economic and population growth. In 1822, the entry in a geography book read:\n\nHöchst, at the confluence of the Nidda and the Main, with 1516 inhabitants, tobacco and other factories, strong trade. The Bolongaro building adorns this lively little town.\nThe first stage of the Taunusbahn from Frankfurt to Höchst was opened on September 26, 1839. It was one of the first German railroads. The first Höchst station was located at the level crossing on today's Königsteiner Straße. The line to the Nassau residence of Wiesbaden was completed by the beginning of 1840. In 1847, the branch line to the then very popular spa town of Soden opened.\nAfter the March Revolution of 1848, which did not pass Höchst by, the Nassau government decided on an administrative reform. A law passed in December 1848 to reorganize the municipal administration introduced an honorary municipal council elected for four years. The municipal council was elected by the municipal assembly and consisted of a mayor, a council clerk and a number of municipal councillors that varied according to the size of the municipality. From 1860 to 1887, Höchst had four honorary mayors.\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution in Germany reached its first peak. The Duchy of Nassau did all it could to promote the establishment of industry, while the Free City of Frankfurt did not want to tolerate any large factories within its borders. As early as 1856, the first Simeons, Ruth and Co. chemical products factory was opened in Höchst. In 1863, the two Frankfurt entrepreneurs Eugen Lucius and his brother-in-law Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Meister founded the company Theerfarbenfabrik Meister, Lucius & Co. The initially very small company grew rapidly. Under the name Farbwerke Höchst vorm. Meister Lucius & Brüning AG and later as Hoechst AG, it became the largest chemical and pharmaceutical group in the world. In the vernacular of Höchst, the plant always kept the name Rotfabrik, after one of the young company's first products, the red dye Fuchsin.\n\n\n=== Groß-Höchst - The Prussian district and industrial town ===\n\nThe Duchy of Nassau was on the side of the German Confederation in the German War and was therefore one of the losers of the war. The Duchy was annexed by Prussia together with the Free City of Frankfurt and the Electorate of Hesse. From 1867 to 1885, the town of Höchst belonged to the new district of Wiesbaden in the province of Hesse-Nassau. In 1886, Höchst became the county seat of the newly founded district of Höchst.\nOn December 31, 1866, the Prussian administration finally abolished the Mainz customs duty. The last two Höchst customs officials left their posts on February 15, 1867, the office's equipment was auctioned off and the buildings were rented out as private apartments. The customs tower was converted into a school in 1870.\nThe new Main-Lahn Railway to Limburg was put into operation in 1877. When the Limburg line was built in 1880, a new station building was erected on the current site. It was located as an island station between the tracks and was accessible via a cul-de-sac from Königsteiner Straße. In 1902, the Königsteiner Bahn to Königstein im Taunus was opened. In 1914, the last public building project in Höchst before the First World War was a new railroad station, the third after 1839 and 1880. With its twelve tracks and the representative Art Nouveau-style station building, it was a symbol of the rapid growth that the town experienced due to its rise as a chemical site.\n\nThe population jumped from 6517 in 1885 to 14,000 in 1905, and more industrial and craft businesses settled here. In 1908, Höchster Hafen was expanded on the banks of the Main for the growing transportation of goods on the river. The previously flat bank was heaped up by two meters. New districts were laid out, and the Westend with its Wilhelminian style and Art Nouveau buildings was created. While the city map of 1864 still shows a city layout that is almost indistinguishable from the late medieval expansion in the Old Town and the New Town has hardly grown beyond Emmerich-Joseph's plan, the city map of 1898 illustrates Höchst's rapid growth within thirty years.\nReligious life in the town also became more diverse. While Höchst had previously been traditionally Catholic as a Mainz possession, Protestants and citizens of the Jewish faith were now moving in. With financial support from the industrialist Adolf von Brüning, the Protestant town church was built in 1882. In 1905, the Jewish community inaugurated its new synagogue on today's market square. In 1909, the new Catholic parish church of St. Joseph was consecrated, the construction of which was financed by the Prussian state as a result of the expropriation of church property during the secularization of 1803. This was decided in 1906 in a court case between the Catholic parish and the Prussian treasury known as the Höchster Kirchenbauprozess.\nUltimately, the voluntary administration was no longer able to cope with the problems of the growing industrial city. Without the massive influence of Farbwerke Hoechst and its founding families on the social and cultural development of the city and their construction of social housing for the working class, Höchst's infrastructure would have long since collapsed. In 1888, Höchst got its first full-time mayor in Eugen Gebeschus. The administrative lawyer quickly committed himself to planned urban development that organized the city's growth and structured the available space. In 1907, Höchst acquired the Bolongaro Palace, which had previously been used as a residential and industrial building, for the growing city administration and had it converted into a town hall.\nIn the middle of the First World War, on April 1, 1917, the municipalities of Unterliederbach, Sindlingen and Zeilsheim were incorporated into Höchst am Main. The new town was now called Groß-Höchst and suddenly had 32,000 inhabitants. Its mayor Ernst Janke, incumbent from 1911 to 1923, was appointed Lord Mayor by Wilhelm II.\n\n\n=== After the First World War - French occupation and inflation ===\n\nAfter the end of the war, the areas of Germany on the left bank of the Rhine were occupied by France as a result of the Treaty of Versailles. There were also three bridgeheads on the right bank of the Rhine, each within a radius of thirty kilometers around Cologne, Koblenz and Mainz. Höchst was located within the Mainz occupation area and was occupied by French troops on December 14, 1918, which included not only Frenchmen from the mother country but also soldiers from the French colonies of Morocco and Algeria. They took up quarters in the Höchster barracks built especially for them. A border crossing (customs border) was set up at the Nidda bridge to Nied and street name signs in French were put up. Mayor Janke was expelled in 1919 for resisting the occupying power, and his successor Bruno Asch met the same fate in 1923. He conducted official business by telephone from Frankfurt until 1925, before becoming city treasurer there and handing over his office to Bruno Müller, the last mayor of Höchst. The French occupation did not end until 1930.\nThe Technical Administration Building by Peter Behrens, one of the most important expressionist industrial buildings, was built at the Höchst plant between 1920 and 1924. Between the station and Königsteiner Straße, one of the few Expressionist parks in Germany, today's Bruno-Asch-Anlage, was laid out south of the railroad embankment. The Höchst city architect Carl Rohleder had radical plans for a \"Groß-Höchst\", which envisaged the demolition and redevelopment of almost the entire old town. They could not be realized due to Höchst's financially weak situation. Inflation and the costs of the French occupation between 1918 and 1930 had emptied the city's coffers. In addition, trade tax income had fallen considerably after I.G. Farben, to which Hoechst AG also belonged, was transformed from an interest group into a corporation headquartered in Frankfurt in 1925. The majority of the tax revenue from Hoechst AG now flowed into the neighboring city. Little was invested in the Höchst plant during these years, as the new group had its main focus in central Germany.\nThe economic interests of the Group and its headquarters in Frankfurt prompted the Prussian government to exert pressure on the Höchst administration. If Höchst did not voluntarily allow itself to be incorporated into Frankfurt, the Prussian state parliament would force it to do so by means of a legislative act. In order to avoid having incorporation conditions dictated to it and to continue to benefit from the vital tax revenue, the Höchst magistrate decided to voluntarily relinquish its independence. On January 5, 1928, the city council passed the incorporation agreement negotiated with Frankfurt with its annex on Höchst's further development. The previous mayor of Höchst, Bruno Müller (SPD), became a department head in Frankfurt.\n\n\n== A district of Frankfurt - Höchst since 1928 ==\n\n\n=== From the late 1920s to the end of the Second World War ===\n\nOn April 1, 1928, Höchst lost its municipal independence after 573 years and became a district of Frankfurt (Frankfurt-West). The old town and the Höchst districts incorporated in 1917 became Frankfurt districts. The French military administration initially opposed the incorporation, but then agreed to it. After the last French troops had left in December 1929, the French occupation of Höchst formally ended in June 1930.\nHowever, Höchst remained the seat of the district administration of the Main-Taunus district, which was newly formed from the old district of Höchst and the old district of Wiesbaden as part of a territorial reform, until 1980.\nWhen the National Socialists came to power, Höchst's local political situation changed. The incorporation treaty provided for a high degree of autonomy for the district, which also included its own budget. This did not fit in with the centralist leadership principle of the new rulers, and Höchst became a dependent administrative district of Frankfurt. Building projects and urban development measures promised in the annex to the treaty were not carried out and the treaty disappeared into the city archives.\nThe National Socialists quickly began expropriating Höchst's Jewish population. The owners of the large city department store Schiff, which opened on Königsteiner Straße in 1929, were forced to sell; the department store was sold to the Hertie Group via an intermediate owner. The shoe factory R. & W. Nathan OHG, located opposite the station, was also \"aryanized\" and half of its shares were acquired by Dresdner Bank. The company was renamed ADA-ADA-Schuh AG and the owners were forced to emigrate. During the November pogroms of 1938, the synagogue built in 1905 on the market square was burnt down by SA men; the fire department merely protected surrounding houses from the fire. An air raid shelter was built in place of the synagogue. A memorial plaque on its west façade today commemorates the event.\nIn contrast to the city center of Frankfurt and other parts of the city, Höchst was only slightly damaged in the air raids on Frankfurt am Main during the Second World War. Four houses were destroyed in air raids in 1940, killing 13 people. In particular, the Hoechst AG plants were only slightly damaged. Only one production plant, the telephone exchange and the plant library were destroyed. A total of 53 houses were hit in Höchst. According to eyewitness reports, there was not a single heavy air raid in Höchst.\nThe last bombardment of Höchst by US artillery took place on the evening of March 27, 1945. On March 29, 1945, American troops marched into Höchst and occupied the district and the chemical plant.\n\n\n=== The development of Frankfurt-Höchst after 1945 ===\n\nIn July 1945, the AFN soldiers' radio station set up shop in Höchst Castle. The studios were located in the New Castle, the crew quarters in the Old Castle. The station remained in the castle until Hessischer Rundfunk moved into a new building in 1966.\nIn 1947, Höchster Porzellanmanufaktur was re-established at the instigation of Höchster journalist Rudolf Schäfer. After Hoechst AG made a financial contribution, the company was able to continue in 1965. Between 1977 and 2002, it was based in the Dalberger Haus in the old town; since then, the company has been based in Höchster Palleskestraße.\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, the incorporation treaty and its unfulfilled points came up for discussion again. The people of Höchst were still waiting for a connection to the Frankfurt tramway, and the contractually promised market hall, indoor swimming pool and Main Bridge had not yet been built. In 1953, Höchster citizens founded a committee with the slogan \"Break Frankfurt's chains\", which wanted to see the town removed from Frankfurt. As the Lord Mayor of Frankfurt, Walter Kolb, lived in a side wing of the Bolongaro Palace, he was able to get a direct impression of the discontent of the people of Höchst. On his initiative, the market hall and the indoor swimming pool were built and inaugurated in November 1955. The tramway was extended from Nied to Zuckschwerdtstraße in the east of Höchst. Other parts of the contract have only been fulfilled since the mid-1990s, such as the construction of a bridge over the Main in 1994 and the construction of the railroad station for Zeilsheim and Sindlingen in 2007.\nThe Höchster Schloßfest was held for the first time in 1957. In the years that followed, it developed into a cultural highlight of the region.\nA first approach to monument protection in Höchst was made in 1959 with a building statute issued by the City of Frankfurt, which placed some houses in Höchst's old town under protection. This led to a local statute in 1972, which placed Höchst's old town as a whole under monument protection. In the following years, the streets of the old town were repaved and new streetlights were installed. Many historic buildings have since been renovated.\nOn July 4, 1979, the Hessian state parliament decided to move the administration of the Main-Taunus district from Höchst to Hofheim am Taunus, meaning that Höchst lost its status as a district town after almost two centuries. However, it remained the seat of the district administration until 1987. Until 1980, Höchst also had its own vehicle registration office for the license plate FH (Frankfurt-Höchst).\nSince the 1970s, there has been a continuous population decline in Höchst. The district had and still has the reputation of being an industrial district with a low quality of living. In 2005, 39 percent of the population were migrants, which has led to social tensions and the formation of ghettos. The construction of shopping centers such as the Main-Taunus-Zentrum on Höchst's doorstep has lured traditional customers away from the Vordertaunus. After the district administration moved away, government employees and visitors also disappeared as customers from Höchst's stores. As a result, the retail sector in Höchst entered a crisis at the end of the 1980s.\nAnother economic turning point for the district came in the mid-1990s with the division and dissolution of Farbwerke Hoechst. The number of people employed at Industriepark Höchst fell from over 30,000 (around 1980) to less than 20,000 at times, and the shopping spree that used to be the norm for Rotfabriker employees during their lunch break became a victim of efforts to constantly increase efficiency. In 2007, the industrial park is a thriving location for more than 90 companies, which once again employ around 22,000 people, but generate little turnover for Höchst's retail and restaurant trade. The financial support of the former Hoechst AG for social, cultural and monument protection projects in the district also largely failed to materialize.\nThe conversion of a section of Königsteiner Strasse between Bolongarostrasse and Hostatostrasse into a pedestrian zone in 1990 was unable to halt the downward trend in Höchst's retail trade. Many specialist stores moved away or gave up, vacant business premises and stores selling low-price goods have characterized the image of Höchst's shopping streets ever since. For this reason, the City of Frankfurt decided in 2006 to support Höchst's urban development with twenty million euros over the next ten years in order to make Höchst an attractive residential and business location again.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nMartin Zeiller: Höchst.

        "content": "Henry Frank Wajda (November 27, 1934 – July 29, 1973) was an American Thoroughbred horse racing jockey who won over 2,200 races and was a leading jockey at New England tracks.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWajda was born in 1934 in Newmarket, New Hampshire. Prior to his career as a jockey, he worked in a shoe factory in his hometown. By 1954, he was riding Thoroughbreds as an apprentice at Laurel Park in Maryland. By 1957, he was riding at Rockingham Park in New Hampshire and had picked up the nickname \"Hammerin' Hank\". In October 1957, while riding at Suffolk Downs in Massachusetts, Wajda twice won five races in a single day, each time winning four races consecutively.On September 6, 1958, Wajda set a world record at Rockingham Park; riding Mark Antony, he covered 1 mile and 70 yards—1,830 yards (1.67 km)—in 1:39+1⁄5, besting the prior record by 1⁄5 of a second.On June 30, 1960, while riding Lusty Andy at Suffolk Downs, Wajda pulled fellow jockey Anthony DeSpirito back onto Color Bearer after DeSpirito had been knocked off his saddle in the first turn and was clinging to his mount by one hand and had a foot caught in a stirrup. DeSpirito credited Wajda with saving his life. For his bravery, Wajda received honors from the New England Turf Writers and New York Turf Writers organizations.In 1961, Wajda's annual income was estimated at $40,000 ($407,840 in 2023). That year, he missed five weeks of riding after suffering a shoulder injury in a race at Lincoln Downs in Rhode Island. In June 1962, Wajda was thrown from horses twice in one day at Suffolk Downs—once in a race, and then again prior to the next race—but was not injured. In 1963, he was reportedly the highest-paid professional athlete in New Hampshire. That season, he won 73 races in 42 days at Suffolk Downs.Wajda died in 1973, as the result of a racing accident at Rockingham Park. Riding Zabush on July 28, 1973, Wajda fell from his mount after his right stirrup broke at the start of a race; he was kicked by the horse, and suffered a punctured lung. He died the next day following surgery in Methuen, Massachusetts.During his career, Wajda won 2224 races, finished second 2131 times, and finished third 1930 times, capturing over $6 million in winnings. At the time of his death, Wajda was a resident of Hollywood, Florida, and Raymond, New Hampshire. He had married Mary Lasofsky in June 1960 in Salisbury, Massachusetts. A race in his honor, the Henry Wajda Memorial Handicap, was established in 1974 and was held annually at Rockingham Park through at least 1997. In 2024, a New Hampshire historical marker (no. 290) honoring Wajda was erected near his burial site in his hometown.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The History Center of Olmsted County (HCOC) is a non-profit organization located in Rochester, Minnesota, dedicated to collecting, preserving, and interpreting the history of Olmsted County. Founded in 1926 as the Olmsted County Historical Society.\n\n\n== Exhibits and Programs ==\nThe HCOC operates a museum with permanent and temporary exhibits that explore the rich history of Olmsted County, from the lives of its earliest inhabitants to the rise of Rochester as a global healthcare center.Beyond the museum walls, the HCOC offers a range of educational programs for all ages. School tours explore various historical themes, while lecture series delve deeper into specific topics. Family-friendly events and workshops provide opportunities for hands-on learning and engagement with history.\n\n\n=== Creepy Doll Contest ===\nThe History Center of Olmsted County (HCOC) curates a unique annual event called the \"Creepy Doll Contest.\" Launched in 2019, the contest taps into the public's fascination with the unsettling. Staff delve into the HCOC's collection of over 100 antique dolls, selecting particularly eerie specimens.  These dolls are then showcased on social media, with the public voting for the creepiest one.  The contest has garnered national attention.\n\n\n== Research ==\nThe HCOC houses a comprehensive research library and archives, containing over 600,000 items related to Olmsted County and southeastern Minnesota. These resources include maps, photographs, diaries, journals, books, and archival materials. These resources are available for researchers and genealogists. HCOC staff provides research assistance and offers educational programs on genealogical research methods.\n\n\n== Historic Sites ==\nIn addition to the museum and archives, the HCOC operates and maintains several Olmsted County historic sites:\n\n\n=== William Dee Log Cabin ===\nConstructed in 1862 by Irish immigrant William Dee and neighbors, the cabin faced destruction in 1911. Saved by the Rochester DAR, it was donated to Mayo Park in honor of W.W. Mayo. After again falling into disrepair, it was moved to the Olmsted County Historical Society in 1961 and was reconstructed in 1986.\n\n\n=== Hadley Valley School House ===\nThe Hadley Valley Schoolhouse, built in 1885 in Haverhill township near Rochester, accommodated both boys and girls until 1957. A new brick building was constructed to accommodate more students. The schoolteacher taught grades 1–8 to around 35 students, covering subjects like arithmetic, history, spelling, and geography.  Electricity and an indoor bathroom were added in the 1930s. The schoolhouse was relocated to the fairgrounds in 1961 and then to the History Center in 1975, where it has been preserved.\n\n\n=== George Stoppel Farm ===\nThe George Stoppel Farmstead, acquired by the Olmsted County Historical Society in 1972, now stands as a registered national historic site, remembering the early pioneers and agricultural history of Southeast Minnesota.\n\n\n=== Mayowood Historic Home ===\nThe seasonal tours of Mayowood offer a look into the lives of the Mayo family, founders of the Mayo Clinic. Built in 1910 by Dr. Charlie and Edith Mayo, this 23,000-square foot home in southeast Minnesota is a concrete construction marvel. Once a 3,300-acre estate, it now showcases original Mayo family artifacts reflecting their global travels and role as hosts to the community and VIP guests. Surrounded by a terrace overlooking the Zumbro River, botanical gardens, and an Oriental Tea House, the property is owned by Mayo Clinic and operated by the History Center of Olmsted County.\n\n\n== Community Engagement ==\nThe HCOC actively engages with the community through various programs and events. They participate in Museums for All, offering free admission to those receiving food assistance. Additionally, they host lectures, author talks, family-friendly events, and historical reenactments.\nThe History Center of Olmsted County serves as a vital resource for anyone interested in learning more about the rich history of Olmsted County. Through its collections, exhibits, and programs, the HCOC helps connect the past to the present, fostering a deeper understanding of the community's identity.\n\n\n== History of organization ==\n\n\n=== Early Beginnings (1926-1972) ===\nThe organization was established in 1926 as the Olmsted County Historical Society. Their mission was to collect and safeguard historical artifacts, documents, and stories of Olmsted County. The fledgling organization initially operated out of the Rochester Public Library basement, opening its first museum space in 1940.In 1959, the HCOC acquired the Bethel English Lutheran Church building, offering a dedicated museum space. However, this location soon proved inadequate for the growing collection. Recognizing the need for a permanent home, the HCOC purchased land in southwest Rochester in 1972 and constructed a new museum building.\n\n\n=== Expansion and Growth (1972-Present) ===\nThe new museum facility, established in 1972, provided the HCOC with the space necessary to expand its collections, exhibits, and educational programs. Over the years, the HCOC has continued to acquire and manage additional historical sites, including the William Dee Log Cabin (1862), Hadley Valley School House (one-room schoolhouse), and the George Stoppel Farmstead.In 2006, the Olmsted County Historical Society officially adopted the name History Center of Olmsted County to better reflect its broader mission. The HCOC remains a non-profit organization governed by a board of directors and supported by volunteers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Minnesota\n\n\n== References ==",
