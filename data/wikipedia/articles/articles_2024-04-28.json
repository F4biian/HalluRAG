        "content": "Hermenegildo Elices Rivas (13 April 1914 – 7 March 1964) was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward for Athletic Bilbao, and Real Madrid CF.\nHe won back-to-back Copa del Rey titles with both Bilbao (1943 and 1944) and Madrid (1946 and 1947), along with two league titles with the red and white club.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nHermenegildo Elices was born in the Biscayan town of Sestao on 13 April 1914. After playing for SD Leioa and Sestao Sport Club, he joined Athletic Bilbao in 1934, with whom he made his debut in the First Division on 30 September. In his next two games in the First Division he scored two doubles against Real Sociedad and FC Barcelona.\nHis stint there ended in 1936 due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, and during the last year of the war, he played for one year at Deportivo Alavés before returning to Athletic in 1939 and staying there for another five seasons. In total, he played 116 official matches (79 in the League, 27 in the Copa del Rey, and 10 in the Regional Championship), scoring 38 goals. With Athletic, he won the League twice in 1935–36 and 1942–43 and two Cup titles in 1943 and 1944. He started in the 1943 cup final, which ended in a 1–0 victory over his future club Madrid, and he also played in the 1942 final, in which he scored in a 3–4 loss to Barcelona. Notably, on 27 April 1941, Elices netted a hat-trick against Athletic-Aviation, the soon-to-be Atlético Madrid, to help his side to a 6–2 win in the 1941–47 FEF President Cup.\nIn 1944, the 30-year-old Elices signed for Real Madrid, where he played his last four years as a professional. In total, he played 28 League and 11 Cup games for the white club, scoring seven goals, and won the Copa del Rey in 1946 and 1947, starting in the former final to help his side to a 3–1 victory over Valencia CF.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nAthletic Club\n\nLa Liga:\nWinners (2): 1935–36 and 1942–43\nCopa del Rey:\nWinners (2): 1943 and 1944\nMadrid FC\n\nCopa del Rey:\nWinners (2): 1946 and 1947\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Josep Elías Juncosa (27 May 1880 – 28 January 1944) was a Spanish sports journalist and athlete, who played football as a midfielder for FC Barcelona between 1900 and 1903, although he never played an official match for the club. He was one of the greatest promoters and promoters of sports in Catalonia in the first third of the 20th century.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nJosep Elías was born in 1880 in Tarragona. At a young age, he moved to Barcelona where he became interested in gymnastics, cycling, football, and sailing, and therefore, he became a member or director of several organizations about those sports, such as the Spanish Cycling Union, the Spanish Gymnastics Federation, and the Catalan Sports Confederation (1922), and also in clubs, such as the Real Yacht Club and Royal Barcelona Maritime Club, FC Barcelona, ​​Sportsmen's Club, Catalunya Lawn Tennis Club, and Hiking Club of Catalonia. On 15 January 1917, he was invinted to be the second president of the Catalan Athletics Federation, but he did not accept it and this position was taken by Joan Matas instead.\nElías only played three matches for FC Barcelona, one per season between 1900 and 1903 and with all being friendlies, including the first-ever Derbi Barceloní on 23 December 1900, which ended in a 0–0 draw. Later when he became a journalist, he recalled having witnessed football matches at the Hippodrome of Can Tunis in early 1893, aged 13, between members of the Club de Regatas and Barcelona Football Club, the first-ever incarnation of FC Barcelona that mainly consisted of players from the British colony of Barcelona, but also with Catalans, and in fact, Elias remembered his fellow sports journalist Alberto Serra as one of the first Catalan footballers.\nIn the early 1910s, Elías used to give lectures and conferences on sport and Olympism at the Gimnasio Garcia Alsina, becoming a great critic of the Spanish Olympic Committee (Comité Olímpico Español, COE) of Gonzalo Figueroa y Torres, the Marquess of Villamejor, while Narciso Masferrer, who had the same interests and objectives than him, adopted a lower profile, hence fulfilling the roles of Good cop, bad cop. In his conferences he stated that the COE was \"like the dog in the manger, it neither does nor lets things be done\" and described its leaders as \"lazy\". Elias's campaign against the inactivity of the COE reached its peak on 19 October 1913, when he gave the infamous conference that marked the starting point of Catalan Olympism in Garcia Alsina's gymnasium. The conference was reproduced in various media and provoked the already mentioned response from Villamejor, who was seriously concerned about the possibility outlined by Elias of seeing a Catalan Olympic Committee sending a delegation to 1916 Summer Olympics in Berlin in case a Spanish delegation was not achieved, and asked for help from the Catalan sports leaders, so that Spain would be in the Olympic Games in a letter addressed to Masferrer. On Christmas Day of 1913, it was announced that the COE had authorized Masferrer to establish a Olympic Committee of Catalonia (COC), and thus, on 18 December 1913, Elías wrote to the president of the International Olympic Committee, Baron Pierre de Coubertin requesting, without success, the recognition of the Catalan Olympic Committee. Coubertin responded to Elias and Juncosa's letter of December 1913 by telling him that the IOC could not recognize more than one committee per country, but that he could accept it as a kind of regional committee within the COE. Despite having been forced to accept a Catalan regional committee dependent on the COE, Villamejor was suspicious of Elias' true intentions and wrote to Coubertin on 5 January 1914, stating: \"I see that you are aware of all the agitation promoted in Barcelona by Mr. Elias Juncosa. It is always the same story, they want to consider themselves independent, without wanting to understand that their only right of existence is to be Spanish\".\nOn 21 January 1922, he participated in the assembly of entities and personalities Catalans who constituted the so-called Sports Confederation of Catalonia.\n\n\n== Journalistic career ==\nAs a journalist, Elías directed Los Deportes in 1903 and worked at La Veu de Catalunya, where he signed under the pseudonym Corredisses for more than thirty years. He also collaborated in the Levantine Illustration (1900–01) and the Catalan Illustration (1901–15), and directed the newsletter of the Spanish Cycling Union (1910) and Stadium (1913). Along with Narciso Masferrer, Ricardo Cabot, and Jaime Garcia Alsina, Elías was one of the pioneers of sports journalism in Catalonia, and together, they founded the Union of Sports Journalists in 1911, whose purpose was to defend, regulate and disseminate sports journalism which until then was self-taught.\nIn 1913, Elías took charge of the Los Sports library and promoted the dissemination of its collection, of which he himself was the author of the first volume: Football Asociación. He wrote and published books about sport pedagogy (1916), Ball games (1917), and Exercicis de mar (Sea exercises, 1918), the first sports book of this type in the Catalan language. He also contributed to the construction of the Barcelona Swimming Club, founded by Bernat Picornell and Manuel Solé, and of the Montjuïc Olympic Stadium.\n\n\n== Politic career ==\nPolitically, Elías joined the Regionalist League of Catalonia, from which he promoted Barcelona's Olympic candidacy for the 1924 Olympic Games.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1910, Elías married the distinguished artist Carlota Campins in a ceremony held in the monastery of Montserrat.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nElías died in Barcelona on 28 January 1944, at the age of 63. In 1992, his son Raimon wrote his biography, Josep Elias i Juncosa \"Corredisses\", a forerunner of Catalan Olympism.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eriko Kishida (岸田 衿子, Kishida Eriko, January 5, 1929 – April 7, 2011) was a Japanese poet, children's author, lyricist, and translator. She is known for writing the lyrics to popular animated children's television shows like Anne of Green Gables and Heidi, Girl of the Alps, as well as her children's picture books. Kishida was a member of the Kai group and published poetry in the \"Kai\" literary magazine founded by Noriko Ibaragi.\n\n\n== Life ==\nEriko Kishida was born in Tokyo Prefecture (now Suginami Ward, Tokyo) as the eldest daughter of the playwright Kunio Kishida and Akiko Murakawa Kishida. Her younger sister was the actress Kyoko Kishida and her cousin was the actor Shin Kishida. Kishida was educated at Rikkyo Jogakuin Elementary School, then Rikkyo Jogakuin Girls' School. She attended Tokyo University of the Arts in the Department of Oil Painting, where she was classmates with close friend and collaborator, the artist Chiyoko Nakatani. Initially aspiring to be a painter, Kishida suffered from a respiratory disease and turned to writing and poetry as a career.\nOn October 4, 1954, Kishida married the poet Shuntaro Tanikawa. They divorced in October 1956. In 1963, she married Ryuichi Tamura and divorced in July 1969. She had at least one son.\nFor most of her life, Kishida lived and worked the foot of Mount Asama in Gunma Prefecture, Japan. Although Kishida herself rarely wrote for adults, starting in her twenties she was active in writing picture books for young children, as well as translating English-language books into Japanese and writing poetry. Over the next fifty years, Kishida gained much respect and recognition as a poet and children's author, in both Japan and in the West. One of her earlier picture books, Kaeritekita Kitsune (1973), was illustrated by her close friend, Chiyoko Nakatani, and won the grand prize at the Sankei Children's Book Awards. Kishida collaborated with Nakatani on many of her children's books, including Kaba-kun.\nKishida published one of her first poetry collections, Wasureta Aki, in 1955, and went on to publish many other poems. Notably, she was a part of the \"Kai\" group affiliated with the poetry magazine of the same name, founded by Noriko Ibaragi in 1953. Some of Kishida's poetry collections include Akarui Hi no Uta (\"Song of a Bright Day) and Sonatine no Ki (\"The Tree of Sonatina).\nIn addition to her published work, Kishida wrote the lyrics for the theme songs of four animated works that aired on the Fuji TV's television show World Masterpiece Theater: Heidi, Girl of the Alps, A Dog of Flanders, Rascal the Raccoon, and Anne of Green Gables.\nKishida continued to publish until she died of meningioma on April 7, 2011, at a hospital in Odawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan at the age of 82.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n=== Publications ===\nTrees: A Collection of Poems and Paintings (co-authored with Minoru Nakamura, Eureka) 1954\nWasureta Autumn (Eureka) 1955 - collection of poems\nThe Lion Story (Shoshi Eureka) 1957 - Poetry collection\nKabakun (illustration by Chiyoko Nakatani, Fukuinkan Shoten) 1966\nJapanese Birthplace (Iwasaki Shoten) 1967\nA Little Camel Hungry (illustration by Naga Shinta, Komine Shoten) 1968\nUncle Noah's Box (illustrations by Chiyoko Nakatani, Iwasaki Shoten) 1969\nGeojio's Birthday (illustration by Chiyoko Nakatani, Akane Shobo) 1970\nBaby's Picture Book 5 volumes (illustrations by Shinta Naga, Hikari no Kuni) 1970\nLet's Play (Shufunotomosha) 1972\nSleepy Cat (illustration by Seiichi Horiuchi, Shufu to Seikatsusha) 1972\nThank you everyone (illustration by Seiichi Horiuchi, Shufu to Seikatsusha) 1972\nThe Fox Came Back (illustrated by Chiyoko Nakatani, published by Kodansha) 1973 - Winner of the Sankei Children's Publishing Culture Award Grand Prize\nGiogio's Bakery (illustration by Chiyoko Nakatani, Akane Shobo) 1975\nCrayon no Uta (Sanrio Publishing) 1976\nSomeone Who Colored the Wind (Seidosha) 1977\nGeojio's Crown (Fukuinkan Shoten) 1978\nWhat Did You Eat?

        "content": "Al-Watan (lit. 'The Homeland') was a weekly publication issued by Hamas until its closure in February 1996 after repeated pressure and suspensions by the Palestinian Authority.\n\n\n== History ==\nAl-Watan was one of the most important opposition periodicals published in Palestinian Authority (PA)-controlled areas. PA officials used the ambiguity of the 1995 Palestinian press law and control over granting news licenses to temper criticism and silence opposition voices, including al-Watan.\nIn 1995, the PA twice suspended al-Watan for 3-month periods, beginning in May and in August, without explanation. According to the publication's editor, the August suspension followed the publication by al-Watan of an article stating that Yasir Arafat had accepted money for allowing a European news agency to publish a photograph of his infant daughter.\nIn May 1995, al-Watan's editor Sayed Musa Abu Musameh was sentenced to prison for 2 years by the state security court in Gaza on charges of incitement against the PA. When the ban on al-Watan was lifted in October 1995, he was still in prison.  In February 1996, Palestinian authorities closed al-Watan along with al-Istiqlal, the press organ of Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Al-Watan was permanently closed in early 1996 following a series of Hamas bombings in Israel.\nSubsequently, Hamas affiliate Islamic Salvation Party began publishing al-Risala ('The Message') on 1 January 1997, which while critical of the PA, avoided issues considered too incendiary. Hamas official Ghazi Hamad, chief editor of al-Watan, became head of al-Risala. Nevertheless, al-Risala was closed several times, including in 1997 after it published an article on Egypt's support of the PA deemed offensive to Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. Supreme Court Chief Justice Qusai Abdallah was forced to resign in January 1998 after giving an interview to al-Risala.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Hainan State Security Department (HSSD; Chinese: 海南省国家安全厅) is a provincial department of the Chinese Ministry of State Security responsible for national security and secret policing in the contiguous island province of Hainan, headquartered in Haikou. Members of the Hainan SSD have badge numbers with prefixes beginning with \"46xxxx\". The HSSD is best known for operating the advanced persistent threat (APT) number 40.\n\n\n== Advanced persistent threat actor ==\n\nThe Hainan State Security Department is behind the advanced persistent threat known as APT40.\nIn May 2021, a US federal grand jury in San Diego, California, returned an indictment against four hackers of the Hainan SSD for hacking attributed to the Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Co., Ltd. (海南仙盾) (Hainan Xiandun), a since disbanded front company, to operate out of Haikou, Hainan Province.\nThe two-count indictment alleged that Ding Xiaoyang (丁晓阳), Cheng Qingmin (程庆民) and Zhu Yunmin (朱允敏), were HSSD officers responsible for coordinating, facilitating and managing computer hackers and linguists at Hainan Xiandun and other MSS front companies to conduct hacking for the benefit of China and its state-owned and sponsored instrumentalities. The indictment alleges that Wu Shurong (吴淑荣) was a computer hacker who, as part of his job duties at Hainan Xiandun, created malware, hacked into computer systems operated by foreign governments, companies and universities, and supervised other Hainan Xiandun hackers.\n\n\n=== Targets ===\nAPT40's campaigns have targeted a range of victims originating in the United States, Austria, Cambodia, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Targeted industries included, among others, aviation, defense, education, government, healthcare, biopharmaceuticals and maritime.\nStolen trade secrets and confidential business information included, among other things, sensitive technologies used for submersibles and autonomous vehicles, specialty chemical formulas, commercial aircraft servicing, proprietary genetic-sequencing technology and data, and foreign information to support China’s efforts to secure contracts for state-owned enterprises within the targeted country (e.g., large-scale high-speed railway development projects).\nIn the most concerning instances, hackers from the Hainan SSD targeted research on highly pathogenic biological agents including Ebola, MERS, HIV/AIDS, Marburg and tularemia, several of which have been historically weaponized as biological warfare agents.\nThe indictment charged the Hainan MSS officers with coordinating intelligence requirements with academics at universities in Hainan and elsewhere in China. Not only did such universities assist the MSS in identifying and recruiting hackers and linguists to penetrate and steal from the computer networks of targeted entities, including peers at many foreign universities, but personnel at one identified Hainan-based university also helped support and manage Hainan Xiandun as a front company, including through payroll, benefits and a mailing address.\n\n\n== List of directors ==\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion",

        "content": "The Monument to the 7th Earl of Carlisle, also known as the Carlisle Memorial Column, is a historic structure associated with Castle Howard, a stately home in North Yorkshire, in England.\nGeorge Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle, was the owner of Castle Howard, and a prominent politician.  He died in 1862, and a monument was commissioned for a location atop Bulmer Hill on the approach to the estate.  It is in the form of a 110 feet (34 m) column.  It was designed by Frederick Pepys Cockerell, with work commencing in August 1867, and being completed in 1869.  The project cost £2,600.\nThe monument was twice struck by lightning.  It was hit by a bomber during World War II, which caused the brazier at its top to fall.  A new brazier was created to the original design and set atop the monument in 2002.  The monument was grade I listed in 1954.\n\nThe monument is built of granite and sandstone, sourced from near Whitby.  It consists of a tall column with garlands hanging down on the north and south sides, a capital carved with scrolls, heads and acanthus leaves.  It is surmounted by a gilt-bronze tripod, which supports a gilded brazier, embellished with a design of flames and swans' heads, designed to reflect the sun.  The column stands on a base approached by steps, with rusticated quoins, an inscription and a plaque, on a platform with knights' helmets on bases at the corners.  The column is 7 feet 4 inches in diameter and is hollow, but no internal staircase was provided, Cockerell contending that its elevated position already provided excellent views.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Bulmer, North Yorkshire\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Livre pour cordes (Book for strings) is a 1968 composition for string orchestra by Pierre Boulez. It is a revised and expanded version of the first two movements of the composer's Livre pour quatuor.\n\n\n== Background ==\nLivre pour quatuor (1948–1949), Boulez's only work for string quartet, presented numerous performative challenges resulting from the composer's inexperience at the time it was written. Boulez recalled that the quartet \"posed great interpretative problems for a quartet,\" and suggested that \"you would need a conductor to solve them.\" In the late 1960s, he withdrew the work from publication, requesting that it no longer be performed except by quartets that had already rehearsed and played it, and began rewriting it for string orchestra (16 first violins, 14 second violins, 12 violas, 10 cellos, 8 double basses), starting with the first two movements (1a, \"Variation\" and 1b, \"Mouvement\"). He recalled:\n\nI felt that the best way of bringing out everything in the original composition would be to orchestrate it. But in an orchestral work one can no longer have the same point of view; so I rethought the music completely, and in the two movements of the Livre for string quartet that became a Livre for string orchestra... there is such a degree of proliferation, and such an additional weight of ideas, that it is almost a new piece.\n\nAccording to Boulez biographer Dominique Jameux, Livre pour cordes sounds \"infinitely better\" than the version for string quartet, although he acknowledged that it lacks some of the earlier work's \"extraordinary vigour, vehemence\nand alacrity.\" Writer Paul Griffiths called the work \"an elaborate amplification which spreads in varying densities around the original, giving it veils of fine counterpoint and harmonic breadth.\" Although Boulez revised the score in 1989, he abandoned the project, and chose not to rescore the remaining movements of the quartet.\n\n\n== Premiere and publication ==\nLivre pour quatuor was premiered on 1 December 1968 in London, at a concert by the New Philharmonia, with Boulez conducting. The revised version was first heard on 12 May 1989 at a concert in Los Angeles, performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Boulez. The score was published by Heugel.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn a review of a 2010 concert by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Boulez, Steve Smith of The New York Times described Livre pour quatuor as \"crepuscular, fitful and dreamy by turns... a compelling display for the Chicago strings,\" while Los Angeles Times reviewer Mark Swed called it \"exquisite, eventful music, full of darting gestures and tiny brilliant explosions.\" Reviewing a 2018 London Symphony Orchestra concert, Bachtrack's Chris Garlick portrayed the piece as \"a work of dense dodecaphony which, despite itself, sounds refined and sensuous almost in the manner of Debussy himself.\"\nComposer and writer James Harley called the piece \"a concentrated, engaging work,\" and suggested that a precedent might be Alban Berg's Lyric Suite, a string quartet part of which was rescored for string orchestra.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSources\n\nBoulez, Pierre (1976).

        "content": "The Carrmire Gate is a folly forming part of the estate landscape of Castle Howard, a country house in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe gate with its towers and flanking walls was constructed in 1725, to a design by Nicholas Hawksmoor.  It is the first in a succession of structures encountered by a visitor travelling to the house, but was the last built.  It is smaller and more decorative than the next, the Pyramid Gate.  At the edge of the estate, it would have originally marked the transition from open fields to the estate's deer park; although in a dip, the openness of the landscape would have made it a prominent landmark.\n\nJohn Dixon Hunt describes the gate as \"very theatrical — pure stage set and, since its extent is so short, clearly incapable of doing any defending at all\".  Vaughan Hart describes it as \"an exercise in effecting... feelings of awe and wonder in the visitor\".\nThe structure is in the Italianate style, reminiscent of the work of Giulio Romano.  It is built of limestone.  The gateway has a round arch with a triple keystone and an open pediment, flanked by square rusticated piers, surmounted by six pyramids.  On each side is an embattled wall extending for about 30 metres (98 ft), and ending in mock medieval turrets, with two stages, cruciform arrow slits and embattled parapets. It has been grade I listed since 1954.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Bulmer, North Yorkshire\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anisonemia is a clade of single-celled protists belonging to the phylum Euglenozoa, relatives of the Euglenophyceae algae. They are flagellates, with two flagella for locomotion. Anisonemia includes various phagotrophic species and a group of primary osmotrophic protists known as Aphagea.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMembers of Anisonemia are unicellular flagellates, protists that have flagella for movement. Species of this lineage have two flagella arising from the anterior region of the cell, unlike their relatives, Peranemida and Euglenophyceae, where only one flagellum is emmergent. They move through a gliding motion, where the posterior flagellum is fully in contact with the substrate and the anterior flagellum beats through its whole length in front of the cell, carrying it forward.\n\n\n== Evolution ==\nAnisonemia is a monophyletic group, or clade, of flagellates that contains several phagotrophic species and a clade that has evolved toward primary osmotrophy, named Aphagea. Anisonemia belongs to the Euglenida, a diverse group of flagellates that also contains the phototrophic Euglenophyceae. Together with other flagellates, they compose the phylum Euglenozoa. In particular, Anisonemia, Euglenophyceae and the phagotrophic Peranemida form a clade known as Spirocuta, distinguished by a greater number of pellicle strips than other euglenids. These strips allow the cells to actively deform their shape, a unique characteristic known as metaboly. The following cladogram depicts the evolutionary relationships of Anisonemia:\n\n\n== Classification ==\nAnisonemia was first described by American protozoologist Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 2016, on the basis of phylogenetic analysis. He proposed it as a subclass of the obsolete class Peranemea, which is paraphyletic with respect to Euglenophyceae, containing Peranemida in addition to Anisonemia. To date, it is the most diverse heterotrophic clade within Spirocuta. It contains two orders, differentiated by their modes of locomotion: Anisonemida, phagotrophs that perform a gliding motion with their anterior flagellum, and Natomonadida, which move by swimming. In turn, Natomonadida comprises two suborders: the phagotrophic Metanemina and the completely osmotrophic Rhabdomonadina, better known as Aphagea. Later revisions to the classification of protists ignored this taxon, until phylogenetic studies of the 2020s supported its monophyly. In some studies, it is referred to as Anisonemea. The composition of Anisonemia is the following:\n\nOrder Anisonemida Cavalier-Smith, 2016\nFamily Anisonemidae Kent, 1880 emend.

It is the first known film to use special effects, specifically the stop trick. Stop motion is closely related to the stop trick, in which the camera is temporarily stopped during the recording of a scene to create a change before filming is continued (or for which the cause of the change is edited out of the film). In the resulting film, the change will be sudden and a logical cause of the change will be mysteriously absent or replaced with a fake cause that is suggested in the scene. The technique of stop motion can be interpreted as repeatedly applying the stop trick. \n\n\n== Births ==\n\n\n=== March ===\nMarch 4: Milt Gross, American animator and cartoonist, (Bray Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio, Screen Gems, adapted his comic strip Count Screwloose into two animated short films). (d. 1953)\n\n\n=== April ===\nApril 22: Margaret J. Winkler, American animation producer and distributor, credited as the first woman to produce and distribute animated films, (founder of Screen Gems, producer of Felix the Cat, distributor of Out of the Inkwell and Alice Comedies)  (d. 1990) .\nApril 30: Verena Ruegg, American animator, camerawoman, and painter, (worked in the ink and paint department of both the Walt Disney Studios and Warner Bros. Cartoons, camerawoman for the animation process during World War II). (d. 1973)\n\n\n=== May ===\nMay 19: Albert Hay Malotte, American film composer, pianist, organist, and educator, (composed the scores for Ferdinand the Bull, The Ugly Duckling, and Little Hiawatha). (d. 1964)\nMay 21: Ben Hardaway, American storyboard artist, animator, voice actor, gagman, screenwriter, and animation director, (co-creator of Bugs Bunny and Woody Woodpecker, main writer of the Woody Woodpecker short films from 1940 to 1951, voice actor of Woody Woopecker from 1944 to 1949, writer of Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat). (d. 1957)\n\n\n=== June ===\nJune 14: Cliff Edwards, American musician and voice actor, (voice of Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio  and Fun and Fancy Free (1947), and Dandy (Jim) Crow in Dumbo. (d. 1971)\n\n\n=== November ===\nNovember 4:\nJack King, American animation director and animator, (directed films for the Judge Rummy, Buddy, Beans,  Porky Pig, and Donald Duck series). (d. 1958)\nBen Sharpsteen, American animation director and film producer, (sequence director for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, supervising director for Pinocchio and Dumbo, production supervisor for Fantasia, Fun and Fancy Free,  Melody Time, The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, Cinderella, and Alice in Wonderland).

        "content": "Ourisia spathulata is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to high-elevation habitats in Southland on the South Island of New Zealand. Mary Kalin Arroyo described O. spathulata in 1984. Plants of this species of New Zealand mountain foxglove are perennial, small-leaved herbs that are covered in a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs. They have velvety, hairy, crenate, spathulate leaves that are oppositely arranged and tightly packed along the creeping stem. The flowers are single or in pairs in each node, with a zygomorphic calyx and corolla. The corolla is white and the corolla tube is glabrous and yellow inside. It is listed as At Risk - Naturally Uncommon.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nOurisia spathulata Arroyo is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. Mary Kalin Arroyo described O. confertifolia in 1984.\nThe type material was collected by David Given in the Eyre Mountains, Southland, South Island, New Zealand. The holotype is housed at the Allan Herbarium of Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research.\nOurisia spathulata is morphologically similar to other New Zealand small-leaved species, namely O. sessilifolia, O. simpsonii, and O. confertifolia, with which it shares irregular white corollas and having a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs on many plant parts.\nO. spathulata can be distinguished from O. sessilifolia by its non-rosette habit (vs. rosette), obovate or spathulate leaves (vs ovate to broadly ovate), very long glandular hairs on the upper side of the leaf (vs. absent or short glandular hairs), hairy leaves on the underside (vs. glabrous), irregular calyces (vs. regular), corolla tube that is yellow and glabrous (hairless) inside (vs. purple and with 1 or 3 lines of hairs inside), and flowers and bracts in pairs only (vs. sometimes in whorls).\nO. spathluata can be distinguished from O. confertifolia by its leaves found along the stem (vs. rosette habit), leaves very densely glandular-hairy with a velvety appearance on the upper side (vs. a silky appearance on the upper side), and usually longer inflorescences ( > 10 cm long vs. < 9 cm long).\n\n\n== Description ==\nOurisia spathulata plants are perennial herbs. The stems are creeping, with leaves usually tightly packed and opposite or sometimes forming subrosettes. Leaf petioles are 3.8–21.8 mm long. Leaf blades are 7.6–29.4 mm long by 7.0–20.3 mm wide (length: width ratio 1.0–1.4: 1), spathulate, obovate to very broadly obovate, widest above the middle, with a rounded apex, cuneate base and obscurely and regularly crenate edges. Leaves are densely hairy and velvety with a mixture of long glandular and non-glandular hairs on the upper surface, and densely hairy with short to long glandular hairs on the lower surface (rarely with non-glandular hairs also mixed in), and with prominent veins on the lower surface. Inflorescences are erect, densely hairy racemes up to 190 mm long, with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs, and with 1–4 flowering nodes and up to 8 total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node has 1–2 flowers and 2 sessile, sometimes clasping bracts that are oblanceolate to narrowly obovate. The lowest bracts are similar to the leaves, 8.7–14.5 mm long and 3.1–6.1 mm wide, and become smaller toward the apex of the raceme. The flowers are borne on a densely hairy pedicel that is up to 24 mm long and has a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs. The calyx is 6.4–9.1 mm long, irregular, with 3 lobes divided to one-third to two-thirds the length of the calyx and 2 divided to near the base, and densely hairy with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs (or sometimes lacking non-glandular hairs). The corolla is 18.6–23.8 mm long (including the 7.5–13.6 mm long corolla tube), bilabiate, tubular-funnelform, glabrous and white on the outside, and glabrous and yellow on the inside. The corolla lobes are 4.3–11.1 mm long, spreading, and usually obovate. There are 4 stamens up to 7.0 mm long which are didynamous, with two long stamens included inside the corolla, and 2 short stamens included inside the corolla; a short staminode 0.03–0.07 mm long is also present. The style is 4.2–5.3 mm long, included inside the corolla tube or slightly exserted, with an emarginate to rounded stigma. The ovary is 3.2–3.8 mm long and glabrous. Fruits are capsules 4.5–7.1 mm long and 3.3–4.8 mm wide with loculicidal dehiscence and pedicels up to 21.6 mm long. The number of seeds in each capsule is unknown, 0.6–1.0 mm long; the seed coat has not been examined.\n\nOurisia spathulata flowers from November to January and fruits from January to March.\nThe chromosome number of Ourisia spathulata is 2n=48.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nOurisia spathulata is a New Zealand mountain foxglove that is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand.  It is found only in northern Southland in high-elevation habitats in herbfields, grasslands or rocky, shaded and often dry habitats from 1200 to 1430 m above sea level in the Thomson, Livingstone, and Eyre Mountains, and on East Dome.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nAn individual of O. spathulata was included in phylogenetic analyses of all species of the genus Ourisia using standard DNA sequencing markers (two nuclear ribosomal DNA markers and two chloroplast DNA regions) and morphological data. In all analyses, the sampled individual belonged to the highly supported New Zealand lineage, and in the nuclear ribosomal and combined datasets, it was strongly supported in a clade with two other southern South Island endemic species, Ourisia confertifolia and O. glandulosa.\nIn another phylogenetic study using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), all three sampled individuals formed a highly supported clade that was in turn highly supported as being closely related to O. confertifolia and O. glandulosa. The three sampled individuals of O. confertifolia also comprised one of the significant clusters in the Bayesian clustering analysis.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nOurisia spathulata is listed as At Risk - Naturally Uncommon, with the qualifier Range Restricted (RR) in the most recent assessment (2017–2018) of the New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\tFruits, leaves and flowers of O. spathulata\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ourisia spathulata at Wikimedia Commons\nOurisia spathulata occurrence data from Australasian Virtual Herbarium",

        "content": "Parapliohyrax is an extinct genus of large hyracoid, a group today represented only by the diminutive hyraxes, but showing in fossil archives a large diversity in ecology and morphology. Parapliohyrax lived during the Miocene period, in various localities spanning the entirety of the African continent. Two species have been identified, based on cranial remains : Parapliohyrax mirabilis, the type species, known from the Miocene of Morocco and Tunisia, and P. ngororaensis, discovered in Kenyan and Namibian deposits. Isolated postcranial remains attributed to the genus have been identified in South African and Libyan deposits of the same age.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Description of P. mirabilis ===\nThe holotype specimen of Parapliohyrax, consisting of a relatively complete maxilla and an associated mandible, were first collected soon after the discovery in 1951 of the Beni Mellal fossil locality in Morocco. In 1961, René Lavocat identified the specimen as a new genus and species of hyracoid, which he named Parapliohyrax mirabilis. This description, however, was only superficial, the specimen still being encased in paraffin wax due to its extreme fragility. The fossil stayed in this state for more than a decade until 1977, when Léonard Ginsburg redescribed the holotype after a lengthy preparation, and attributed to the genus various mandibular remains and isolated teeth from the same locality preparated by Jacques Braillon.\n\n\n=== Description of P. ngororaensis ===\n\nBetween 1969 and 1975, extensive excavations in the Ngorora Formation in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya led to the discovery of cranial remains belonging to a new type of large hyracoid. In 1977, Martin Pickford and Martin S. Fischer formally described these new remains as a distinct species, Parapliohyrax ngororaensis. In 1996, additional remains of P. ngororaensis, discovered at Berg Aukas, near Grootfontein, Namibia, were described by Pickford.\n\n\n=== Additional assigned material ===\nIn 1999, the manager of a mine near Hondeklip Bay, in the Northern Cape region of South Africa, discovered in a diamond-bearing locality labeled \"Nova pit\" the remains of a fragmentary metapodial bone that was identified as that of a primitive horse. In 2003, after further inspection, Pickford concluded that this single bone belonged to a large hyrax, and attributed it tentatively, due to the lack of overlapping material, to P. ngororaensis, based on its presence in Berg Aukas at the time of the deposition of the Nova pit. Pickford mentioned in passing in the same paper the presence of P. mirabilis in Miocene deposits near Kairouan, in Tunisia. In 2005, Tsujikawa Hiroshi described a single and isolated premolar tooth coming from the Lower Namurungule Formation, near Baragoi, Kenya, and considered the similarities with those of Parapliohyrax, classifying it as an indeterminate Pliohyracidae due to the paucity of the material and the lack of element of comparison with other taxa. In 2006, an additional isolated metapodial discovered by R. J. G. Savage in the locality W of Djebel Zelten, Libya, was tentatively attributed to Parapliohyrax sp. based on its similarity with the Nova specimen. In the same year, Jean-Albert Rémy and Mouloud Benammi mentioned in passing the presence of Parapliohyrax sp. in the Vallesian fauna of the Aït Kandoula Basin near Toundoute, Morocco.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Cranial material ===\n\n\n==== Maxilla ====\nCranial materials of both species are relatively well preserved, and present a relatively complete dentition. The snout of P. mirabilis was noticeably longer than that of Pliohyrax, with a remarquably deep palate forming a palatine pocket overarching the rear suture of the palatine bones, that can be compared to that of modern lagomorphs, the springhare Pedetes, and the early astrapothere Trigonostylops ; overall, despite many similarities in the shape of the cranium, the skull was more elongated than that of modern hyraxes. As in Procavia, the nasals were projected forwards. The dentition of Parapliohyrax is distinctively more derived than that of most other extinct and modern hyraxes, to the exception of Pliohyrax. The first upper incisor was noticeably larger and stronger, slightly convex towards the palate with a marked bend, and bearing wearing on a posterior face devoid of enamel, as in modern hyraxes. Differences in size between specimens of those incisors were tentatively attributed by Ginsburg to sexual dimorphism. The second upper incisor was slightly spatulate and oriented towards the palate. The third upper incisor was diminutive, premolariform and triangle-shaped. The upper canine and premolar teeth were molariform and quite similar from each others, as in other large hyracoids like Pliohyrax and Megalohyrax.  The molars are much stronger and elongated, with the hypocone of the jugal teeth increasingly protruding towards the back, giving the teeth a typical square profile with wear.\n\n\n==== Mandible ====\nThe body of the mandible of P. mirabilis was relatively high and concave, with a noticeable pit on the internal face between the second premolar and the second molar, similar to that of Meroehyrax, and another, smaller, pit on the external face between the first and the fourth premolar, delimitated towards the front by the mental foramen. The ramus of the mandible, incompletely preserved, seems to have been less vertical than that of the modern Procavia. The lower incisors are spatulated adn dentelated, with a small first lower incisor, a second lower incisor quite strong and slightly coiled, and a third lower incisor triangle-shaped,premolariform and similar in its structure to that of bovids and cervids. The lower canine and premolar teeth are elongated and quite similar, by the presence of a W-shaped ridge crossing their entire section, to those of chalicotheres. The molars bear tubecles in the shape of curved crescents, with the third molar bearing an extensive, internally concave and crescent-shaped lobe, similar to that of modern horses.\n\n\n=== Postcranial material ===\nThe postcranial material attributed to Parapliohyrax is extremely scarce, a condition not uncommon among Cenozoic hyracoids. The only postcranial material attributed to the genus consist in metapodial bones. This attribution is only done tentatively, as there is no material overlapping between these bones and the cranial remains that are relatively well known. This attribution is therefore mostly based on the large size of the remains, only reached by Parapliohyrax in Africa during the Miocene, and on the presence of the genus in their general region.\nTwo metapodial bones have been tentatively referred to Parapliohyrax. The first one, discovered near Hondeklip Bay in Namibia, consist in the distal portion of a metatarsus, reaching 32.6 mm in its maximal diameter. The second, coming from the Djebel Zelten region of Libya, is too fragmentary to determinate whether its a metatarsus or a metacarpus, 29 mm long in its largest diameter. Overall, based on the fossil material, Pickford estimates that P. ngororaensis reached 80 kilos, the weight of the modern blesbok, and the size of a donkey.\n\n\n== Species ==\n\n\n=== Parapliohyrax mirabilis ===\nP. mirabilis is the type species of the genus. Described by Lavocat in 1961, it is known after a fairly complete holotype maxilla, an associated paratype mandible probably coming from the same specimen than the holotype, and several fragmentary and isolated teeth remains. It has been identified in Beni Mellal, Morocco and Kairouan, Tunisia. It is reportedly slightly smaller than P. ngororaensis.\n\n\n=== Parapliohyrax ngororaensis ===\nP. ngororaensis is the largest species of the genus, described in 1987 by Pickford and Fischer, based on KNM BN 1741, a fragmentary skull associated with a damaged mandible. It is known from the Ngorora Formation in Kenya and the Berg Aukas locality in Namibia. P. ngororaensis is known from an abundance of material in the Ngorora Formation, being present in the members B, C, D and E of the formation, with 57 specimens of varying preservation attributed to the species, the remains of crania and mandibles of adults and juveniles being only found in the members C and D.\n\n\n=== Tentatively assigned material ===\nA fragmentary metapodial identified as a tarsometatarsus from the Nova Pit locality in South Africa has been provisionally referred to P. ngororaensis by Pickford in 2003, this identification being tentative due to the lack of associated material. An additional metapodial, from the Gebel Zelten locality in Libya, has been associated to the Nova material. Indeterminate Parapliohyrax material has also been discovered in the Aït Kandoula Basin in Morocco.\nA single isolated premolar, discovered in Miocene rocks of the Namurungule Formation, was formally described by Tsujikawa as belonging to an indeterminate genus and species of Pliohyracidae. Tsujikawa noted the similarities between the Namurungule tooth and those of Parapliohyrax, but opted to describe it as indeterminate due to the paucity of the remains and the need of comparison with European species of Pliohyrax.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Charles A. Ford (August 28, 1855 – December 18, 1933) was a merchant, politician and active Baptist who served a single term in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Clarke and Warren Counties.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in Frederick County, Virginia to farmer William Ford (1811-) and his wife. After the American Civil War, his father operated a mill east of Frederick County in Clarke County's Chapel district. The family included a younger brother and several sisters. Charles was educated at what was then the Shenandoah Valley Academy near Winchester, Virginia (the modern Shenandoah Valley Academy, a boarding school near New Market, Virginia was founded decades later by Seventh Day Adventists). In 1881 he married Annie S. Sprint.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAs an adult, Ford became a merchant and dealt in real estate. He also was active in his church and served as clerk and moderator of the Shenandoah Baptist Association, which had been formed in 1883 at Bethel Memorial Church in Clarke County and now consists of 17 churches in Virginia and West Virginia.\nVoters from Clarke and adjacent Warren county elected him as their (part-time) representative in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1921 (for the term beginning in January 1922), but legislators added Winchester to the district in the reapportionment following the federal census and Boyd R. Richards of Winchester was elected to the larger district in 1923.\nFord died on December 18, 1933.\n\n\n== References ==",

The Germans would also promise Mexico they would send them arms and money if President Huerta would have a war with the United States and would be returned to power. These conspiracies would be found by the United States.\n\n\n== Ypiranga Incident ==\nThe Ypiranga Incident was an Interception by the United States of a German ship named the SS Ypiranga that was carrying shipments of arms and ammunition that were going to supply the Mexican Government. When the U.S Navy captured it they forced the ship to turn back.\n\n\n== Zimmerman Telegram ==\nThe Zimmerman Telegram was a secretive diplomatic plan and communication for Mexico and Japan to join the Central powers that would let Mexico gain all of the Southwest territories that Mexico had lost during the Mexican-American war of 1846-1848. The message would be intercepted by the British and would be shown to the United States. This would lead to the American declaration of war against Germany during World War I.\n\n\n== Alleged involvement in the Battle of Ambos Nogales ==\nIf true or not, the possibility of Germans at the border in Mexico was reasonable enough for a strong U.S. presence on the border of Nogales. There was a report of 2 Germans being killed during the Battle of Ambos Nogales but no evidence or proof is shown.\n\n\n== Citations ==",

Rome considered the territory to be part of Galatia, and second century Roman geographer  Claudius Ptolemy does not mention it within the districts of Cappadocia.

        "content": "Rob Henderson (born December 18, 1990) is an American writer and political commentator known for popularizing the idea of luxury beliefs. His memoir, Troubled: A Memoir of Foster Care, Family, and Social Class, was published in 2024 by Simon & Schuster's Gallery Books. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHenderson was raised in various foster homes around the state of California. He served in the United States Air Force after high school. Following his enlistment, Henderson attended Yale University with the support of the G.I. Bill, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. Henderson then earned a Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology from the University of Cambridge with the support of a Gates Cambridge Scholarship.\n\n\n== Luxury beliefs ==\nHenderson has published a variety of essays about his education and political views in major outlets including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Times. In his editorials, he develops the idea of \"luxury beliefs\", defined as ideas that \"confer status on members of the upper class at little cost while inflicting costs on persons in lower classes.\" This term has gained considerable popularity, including coverage in The Atlantic and The Economist, as well as features on podcasts including Honestly with Bari Weiss and The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast.\n\n\n== Troubled: A Memoir of Foster Care, Family, and Social Class ==\nIn his memoir, Henderson details his experience of being abandoned by his mother and growing up in the foster care system. He explains the emotional challenges he has faced due to the absence of a stable family. The latter section of the book details his educational journey and the experiences which inspired his development of the term \"luxury beliefs\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Black Music Action Coalition (BMAC) is a black activist organization  American record label executive, Courtney Stewart was a founding member and serves on the executive committee for the nonprofit formed in 2020 to combat systemic racism in the music industry. American entertainment lawyer and artist rights advocate, Dina LaPolt is also an active member on the Executive Leadership Council. Willie “Prophet” Stiggers, is Co-Founder, President & CEO. The first Black music action coalition known as Republic Records Action Committee (R2AC), was created by American music industry executive, Steve Carless.\nIn April 2021, American country music singer/songwriter, Morgan Wallen donated $300,000 to the Black Music Action Coalition in the names of 20 people who had counseled him following some \"dumb stuff\". Those individuals were given the option to funnel their respective $15,000 donations to a charity of their choice, or keep the money within the BMAC.\nIn 2021, BMAC and Hip hop music festivals, Rolling Loud partnered Social Justice Initiatives. In 2023, the international hip hop music festival Rolling Loud hosted a panel discussion in support of their Restoring Artistic Protections (RAP) Act initiative on the first day of Rolling Loud Miami. The panel included Stiggers for BMAC, Rolling Loud co-Founder Tariq Cherif, Congressmans Hank Johnson and Jamaal Bowman. The act was introduced as a way to protect artists' creative expression, which has been used against them as evidence in court. \nRegarding Tennessee's ELVIS Act, Stiggers said: “Black Music Action Coalition supports this first-of-its-kind legislation, as the misuse of AI could devastate Black music creators who already face an uphill battle. Our priority is to amplify the larger justice movement in the music industry, and we commend Tennessee for setting the standard in AI protection legislation. We hope to see other states follow in Tennessee’s lead in order to protect the creative community.”\n\n\n== Music in Action Awards ==\nThe Black Music Action Coalition's inaugural Music in Action Awards were presented by The Weeknd.  That year LaPolt herself was honoured for her Black community activism as the recipient of BMAC’s Agent of Change Award alongside civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The History of the Mamluk Sultanate, an empire based in Egypt and Syria, spans the period between the mid-13th century, with the overthrow of the Ayyubid dynasty in Egypt, and 1517, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Mamluk history is generally divided into the Turkish or Bahri period (1250–1382) and the Circassian or Burji period (1382–1517), called after the predominant ethnicity or corps of the ruling Mamluks during these respective eras.\nThe first rulers of the sultanate hailed from the mamluk regiments of the Ayyubid sultan al-Salih Ayyub (r. 1240–1249), usurping power from his successor in 1250. The Mamluks under Sultan Qutuz and Baybars routed the Mongols in 1260, halting their southward expansion. They then conquered or gained suzerainty over the Ayyubids' Syrian principalities. By the end of the 13th century, through the efforts of sultans Baybars, Qalawun (r. 1279–1290) and al-Ashraf Khalil (r. 1290–1293), they conquered the Crusader states, expanded into Makuria (Nubia), Cyrenaica, the Hejaz, and southern Anatolia. The sultanate then experienced a long period of stability and prosperity during the third reign of al-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1293–1294, 1299–1309, 1310–1341), before giving way to the internal strife characterizing the succession of his sons, when real power was held by senior emirs.\nOne such emir, Barquq, overthrew the sultan in 1390, inaugurating Burji rule. Mamluk authority across the empire eroded under his successors due to foreign invasions, tribal rebellions, and natural disasters, and the state entered into a long period of financial distress. Under Sultan Barsbay major efforts were taken to replenish the treasury, particularly monopolization of trade with Europe and tax expeditions into the countryside.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe mamluk was an owned slave, distinguished from the ghulam, or household slave. After thorough training in fields such as martial arts, court etiquette and Islamic sciences, these slaves were freed. They were expected to remain loyal to their master and serve his household. Mamluks had formed a part of the state or military apparatus in Syria and Egypt since at least the 9th century, rising to become governing dynasties in Egypt and Syria as the Tulunid and Ikhshidid dynasties. Mamluk regiments constituted the backbone of Egypt's military under Ayyubid rule in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, beginning under the founder of Ayyubid rule, Sultan Saladin (r. 1174–1193), who replaced the Fatimids' black African infantry with mamluks. Each Ayyubid sultan and high-ranking emir had a private mamluk corps. Most of the mamluks in the Ayyubids' service were ethnic Kipchak Turks from Central Asia, who, upon entering service, were converted to Sunni Islam and taught Arabic. A mamluk was highly committed to his master, to whom he often referred as 'father', and was in turn treated more as a kinsman than as a slave. The Ayyubid emir and future sultan al-Salih Ayyub had acquired about one thousand mamluks (some of them free-born) from Syria, Egypt and Arabia by 1229, while serving as na'ib (viceroy) of Egypt during the absence of his father, Sultan al-Kamil (r. 1218–1238). These mamluks were called the 'Salihiyya' (singular 'Salihi') after their master.\n\nAl-Salih became sultan of Egypt in 1240, and, upon his accession to the throne, he manumitted and promoted large numbers of his original and newly recruited Mamluks on the condition that they remain in his service. To provision his mamluks, al-Salih seized the iqtaʿat (akin to fiefs; singular iqtaʿ) of his predecessors' emirs. Al-Salih created a paramilitary apparatus in Egypt loyal to himself, and his aggressive recruitment and promotion of mamluks led contemporaries to view Egypt as \"Salihi-ridden\", according to historian Winslow William Clifford. Despite his close relationship with his mamluks, tensions existed between al-Salih and the Salihiyya, and a number of Salihi mamluks were imprisoned or exiled throughout al-Salih's reign. While historian Stephen Humphreys asserts that the Salihiyya's increasing dominance of the state did not personally threaten al-Salih due to their fidelity to him, Clifford believes that the Salihiyya developed an autonomy within the state that fell short of such loyalty. Opposition among the Salihiyya to al-Salih rose when the latter ordered the assassination of his brother Abu Bakr al-Adil in 1249, a task that affronted many of the Salihiyya and one which they largely rejected; four of the Salihiyya agreed to execute the controversial operation.\n\n\n== Rise to power ==\n\n\n=== Conflict with the Ayyubids ===\nTensions between al-Salih Ayyub and his mamluks culminated in 1249 when Louis IX of France's forces captured Damietta in their bid to conquer Egypt during the Seventh Crusade. Al-Salih believed Damietta should not have been evacuated and was rumored to have threatened punitive action against the Damietta garrison. The rumor, accentuated by the execution of civilian notables who had left Damietta, provoked a mutiny by the garrison of his camp in al-Mansura, which included several Salihi mamluks. The situation calmed after the intervention of the atabeg al-askar (commander of the military), Fakhr ad-Din ibn Shaykh al-Shuyukh.\nAs the Crusaders advanced, al-Salih died and was succeeded by his son al-Mu'azzam Turanshah, who was in the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) at the time. Initially, the Salihiyya welcomed Turanshah's succession, with many greeting him and requesting confirmation of their administrative posts and iqtaʿ assignments at his arrival to the Egyptian frontier. Turanshah nevertheless challenged the dominance of the Salihiyya in the paramilitary apparatus by promoting his Kurdish retinue from the Jazira and Syria as a counterweight to the predominantly Turkic Salihiyya.\nBefore Turanshah's arrival at the war front with the Crusaders, the Bahriyya, a junior regiment of the Salihiyya commanded by Baybars al-Buduqdari, defeated the Crusaders at the Battle of al-Mansura on 11 February 1250. On 27 February, Turanshah arrived in Egypt from Hisn Kayfa, where he had been emir since 1238/1239, and went directly to al-Mansura to lead the Egyptian army. On 5 April 1250, covered by the darkness of night, the Crusaders evacuated their camp opposite al-Mansura and began to flee northward towards Damietta. The Egyptians followed them into the Battle of Fariskur where the Egyptians destroyed the Crusaders on 6 April. King Louis IX and a few of his surviving nobles surrendered and were taken as prisoners, effectively ending the Seventh Crusade.\nTuranshah proceeded to place his own entourage and mamluks, known as the 'Mu'azzamiya', in positions of authority to the detriment of Salihi interests. On 2 May 1250, a group of disgruntled Salihi officers assassinated Turanshah in his camp at Fariskur. According to Humphreys, al-Salih's frequent wars against his Ayyubid relatives likely voided the Salihiyya's loyalty to other members of the Ayyubid dynasty. Nonetheless, the Salihiyya were careful to portray the assassination of Turanshah not as an assault against Ayyubid legitimacy, but rather an act against a deviant of the Muslim polity. An electoral college dominated by the Salihiyya convened to choose a successor to Turanshah among the Ayyubid emirs, with opinion largely split between al-Nasir Yusuf of Damascus and al-Mughith Umar of al-Karak. Consensus settled on al-Salih's widow, Shajar ad-Durr.\nShajar ad-Durr ensured the Salihiyya's dominance of the paramilitary elite, and inaugurated patronage and kinship ties with the Salihiyya. In particular, she cultivated close ties with the Jamdari (pl. Jamdariyya) and Bahri (pl. Bahriyya) elements of the Salihiyya, by distributing to them iqtaʿ and other benefits. The Bahriyya were named after the Arabic word bahr, meaning 'sea' or 'large river', because their barracks was located on the Nile River island of Roda. They were mostly drawn from among the Cumans-Kipchaks who dominated the steppes north of the Black Sea. Shajar al-Durr's efforts and the lingering desire among the military in Egypt to maintain the Ayyubid state was made evident when the Salihi mamluk and atabeg al-askar, Aybak, attempted to claim the sultanate, but was prevented from monopolizing power by the army and the Bahriyya and Jamdariyya, which asserted that only an Ayyubid could exercise sultanic authority. The Bahriyya compelled Aybak to share power with al-Ashraf Musa, a grandson of Sultan al-Kamil.\n\n\n=== Factional power struggles ===\n\nAybak was one of the eldest Salihi mamluks and a leading member of al-Salih's inner circle, despite only being an amir awsat (middle-ranking emir). He served as the principal bulwark against the more junior Bahri and Jamdari emirs, and his promotion to atabeg al-askar was met with Bahri rioting in Cairo, the first of many incidences of intra-Salihi tensions surrounding Aybak's ascendancy. The Bahriyya and Jamdariyya were represented by their patron, Faris al-Din Aktay, a principal organizer of Turanshah's assassination and the recipient of Fakhr ad-Din's large estate by Shajar al-Durr; the latter viewed Aktay as a counterweight to Aybak. Aybak moved against the Bahriyya in 1251 by shutting their Roda headquarters in a bid to sap Aktay's power base. Aybak was unable to promote his own mamluks, known as the 'Mu'izziya', to senior posts until 1252. That year, he managed to dispatch Aktay to Upper Egypt to suppress a Bedouin uprising. Instead of isolating Aktay, as Aybak intended, the assignment allowed Aktay to impose extortionate taxes in Upper Egypt and provide him the funds to finance his patronage of the Bahriyya. In 1254, Aybak had his Mu'izzi mamluks assassinate Aktay in the Citadel of Cairo.\nAfterward, Aybak purged his retinue and the Salihiyya of perceived dissidents, causing a temporary exodus of Bahri mamluks, most of whom settled in Gaza, but also in Upper Egypt and Syria. The purge caused a dearth of military support for Aybak, which led to Aybak's recruitment of new supporters from among the army in Egypt and the Turkic Nasiri and Azizi mamluks from Syria, who had defected from al-Nasir Yusuf and moved to Egypt in 1250. The Syrian mamluks were led by their patron Jamal ad-Din Aydughdi and were assigned most of the iqtaʿ of Aktay and his allies. Aybak felt threatened by Aydughdi's growing ambitions. After Aybak learned of Aydughdi's plot to topple him and recognize al-Nasir Yusuf as Ayyubid sultan, which would likely leave Aydughdi as practical ruler of Egypt, Aybak imprisoned Aydughdi in Alexandria in 1254 or 1255.\nMeanwhile, the Bahriyya faction in Gaza commanded by Baybars etreated al-Nasir Yusuf to invade Egypt and dislodge Aybak, but al-Nasir Yusuf initially refused. In 1256, he dispatched a Bahri-led expedition to Egypt, but Aybak and al-Nasir Yusuf's army did not engage in battle. Aybak was assassinated on 10 April 1257, possibly on the orders of Shajar al-Durr, who was assassinated a week later. Their deaths left a relative power vacuum in Egypt, with Aybak's teenage son, al-Mansur Ali, as heir to the sultanate. During Ali's reign, Aybak's former close aide, Sayf ad-Din Qutuz, acted as strongman. His relations with the Salihiyya, including the Bahri mamluks, were similarly hostile.\nBy the time of Aybak's death, the Bahriyya had entered the service of al-Mughith Umar of al-Karak, who agreed to invade Egypt and claim the Ayyubid sultanate, but al-Mughith's small Bahri-dominated invading force was routed at the frontier with Egypt in November. The Bahriyya and al-Mughith launched a second expedition in 1258, but were again defeated. The Bahriyya subsequently raided areas around Syria, threatening al-Nasir Yusuf's power in Damascus. After a first attempt to defeat the Bahriyya near Gaza failed, al-Nasir Yusuf launched a second expedition against them with the Ayyubid emir al-Mansur Muhammad II of Hama, resulting in a Bahriyya defeat at Jericho. Al-Nasir Yusuf then besieged al-Mughith and the Bahriyya at al-Karak, but the growing threat of a Mongol invasion of Syria led the Ayyubid emirs to reconcile, and Baybars's defection to al-Nasir Yusuf. Qutuz deposed Ali in 1259. Afterward, he purged and/or arrested the Mu'izziya and any Bahri mamluks he could locate in Egypt in a bid to eliminate his potential opposition. The surviving Mu'izzi and Bahri mamluks went to Gaza, where Baybars had created a shadow state opposed to Qutuz.\n\nWhile mamluk factions competed for control of Egypt and Syria, the Mongols under the command of Hulagu Khan had sacked Baghdad, the intellectual and spiritual center of the Islamic world, in 1258, and proceeded westward, capturing Aleppo and Damascus. Qutuz sent military reinforcements to his erstwhile enemy al-Nasir Yusuf in Syria, and reconciled with the Bahriyya, including Baybars, who was allowed to return to Egypt, to face the common Mongol threat. Hulagu sent emissaries to Qutuz in Cairo, demanding submission to Mongol rule. Qutuz had the emissaries killed, an act which historian Joseph Cummins called the \"worst possible insult to the Mongol throne\". Qutuz then prepared Cairo's defenses to ward off the Mongols' threatened invasion of Egypt, but after hearing news that Hulagu withdrew from Syria to claim the Mongol throne, Qutuz prepared to conquer Syria. He mobilized a 120,000-strong force and gained the support of his main Mamluk rival, Baybars.\nThe Mamluks entered Palestine to confront the Mongol army that Hulagu left behind under the command of Kitbuqa. In September 1260, the two sides met in the plains south of Nazareth in the Battle of Ain Jalut. Qutuz had some of his cavalry hide in the hills around Ain Jalut (lit. 'Goliath's Spring'), while directing Baybars's forces to advance past the spring against Kitbuqa's Mongols. In the ensuing half-hour clash, Baybars's men feigned a retreat and were pursued by Kitbuqa. The latter's forces fell into a Mamluk trap once they reached the spring, with Baybars's men turning around to confront the Mongols and Qutuz's units ambushing the Mongols from the hills. The battle ended in a Mongol rout and Kitbuqa's capture and execution. Afterward, the Mamluks recaptured Damascus and the other Syrian cities taken by the Mongols. Upon Qutuz's triumphant return to Cairo, he was assassinated in a Bahri plot. Baybars subsequently assumed power in late 1260, and inaugurated Bahri rule.\n\n\n== Bahri rule (1250–1382) ==\n\n\n=== Reign of Baybars ===\n\n\n==== Centralisation of power ====\n\nBaybars rebuilt the Bahriyya's former headquarters in Roda Island and put Qalawun, one of his most senior associates, in command of it. In 1263, Baybars deposed al-Mughith of al-Karak based on allegations of collaboration with the Mongol Ilkhanate of Persia, and thereby consolidated his authority over Islamic Syria. During his early reign and at heavy expenditure, Baybars rebuilt and stringently trained the Mamluk army, which grew from 10,000 cavalry to 40,000, with a 4,000-strong royal guard at its core. The new force was rigidly disciplined and highly trained in horsemanship, swordsmanship and archery. Baybars's military and administrative reforms cemented the power of the Mamluk state.\n\n\n==== Postal network ====\nA major component to Baybars's rule was intrastate communication. To accomplish this, he instituted a barid (postal network) that extended across Egypt and Syria. The need for smooth delivery of correspondence also led to the large scale repair or construction of roads and bridges along the postal route.\n\n\n==== Foreign policy ====\nThrough opening diplomatic channels with the Mongols, Baybars also sought to stifle a potential alliance between the Mongols and the Christian powers of Europe, while also sowing divisions between the Mongol Ilkhanate and the Mongol Golden Horde. His diplomacy was additionally intended to maintain the flow of Turkic mamluks from Mongol-held Central Asia.\n\n\n==== Military campaigns ====\nWith Bahri power in Egypt and Muslim Syria consolidated by 1265, Baybars launched expeditions against the Crusader fortresses throughout Syria, capturing Arsuf in 1265, and Halba and Arqa in 1266. According to historian Thomas Asbridge, the methods used to capture Arsuf demonstrated the Mamluks' grasp of siegecraft and their overwhelming numerical and technological supremacy\". Baybars's strategy regarding the Crusader fortresses along the Syrian coast was not to capture and utilize the fortresses, but to destroy them and prevent their potential future use by new waves of Crusaders.\nIn August 1266, the Mamluks launched a punitive expedition against the Armenian Cilician Kingdom for its alliance with the Mongols, laying waste to numerous Armenian villages and significantly weakening the kingdom. At around the same time, Baybars's forces captured Safed from the Knights Templar, and shortly after, Ramla, both cities in interior Palestine. Unlike the coastal Crusader fortresses, the Mamluks strengthened and utilized the interior cities as major garrisons and administrative centers. Campaigns against the Crusaders continued in 1267, and in the spring of 1268, Baybars's forces captured Jaffa before conquering the major Crusader fortress of Antioch on 18 May.\n\nBaybars initiated a more aggressive policy than his predecessors toward the Christian Nubian kingdom of Makuria on Egypt's southern border. In 1265, the Mamluks launched an invasion of northern Makuria, and forced the Nubian king to become a vassal of the Mamluks. Around that time, the Mamluks had conquered the Red Sea areas of Suakin and the Dahlak Archipelago, while attempting to extend their control to the Hejaz (western Arabia), the desert regions west of the Nile, and Barqa (Cyrenaica). In 1268, the Makurian king, David I, overthrew the Mamluks' vassal and in 1272, raided the Mamluk Red Sea port of Aydhab.\nLouis IX of France launched the Eighth Crusade, this time targeting Tunis with the intention of eventually invading Egypt. Louis IX's death was used by the Mamluks as an opportunity to refocus their efforts at the conquest of Crusader territories in Syria, including the County of Tripoli's Krak des Chevaliers fortress, which Baybars captured in 1271. Despite an alliance with the Isma'ili Shia Assassins in 1272, in July 1273, the Mamluks, who by then considered the Assassins' independence as problematic, wrested control of the Assassins' fortresses in the Jabal Ansariya range, including Masyaf.\nIn 1275, the Mamluk governor of Qus, with Bedouin allies, launched an expedition against Makuria, defeating King David in the Battle of Dongola in 1276, and installing Shakanda as king. This brought the fortress of Qasr Ibrim under Mamluk jurisdiction. The conquest of Nubia was not permanent and the process of invading the region and installing a vassal king would be repeated by Baybars's successors. Nonetheless, Baybars' initial conquest led to the annual expectation of tribute from the Nubians by the Mamluks until the Makurian kingdom's demise in the mid-14th century. Furthermore, the Mamluks also received the submission of King Adur of al-Abwab further south. In 1277, Baybars launched an expedition against the Ilkhanids, routing them in Elbistan in Anatolia, but withdrew to avoid overstretching his forces and risk being cut off from Syria by a second, large incoming Ilkhanid army.\n\n\n=== Early Qalawuni period ===\n\nBaybars attempted to establish his Zahirid house as the state's ruling dynasty by appointing his four-year-old son al-Sa'id Baraka as co-sultan in 1264, representing a break from the Mamluk tradition of choosing the sultan by merit rather than lineage. In July 1277, Baybars died en route to Damascus, and was succeeded by Baraka. The latter's ineptness precipitated a power struggle that ended with Qalawun being elected sultan in November 1279. The Ilkhanids took advantage of the disarray of Baybars's succession by raiding Mamluk Syria, before launching a massive offensive against Syria in the autumn of 1281. Qalawun's forces were significantly outnumbered by the estimated 80,000-strong Ilkhanid-Armenian-Georgian-Seljuk coalition, but marched north from Damascus to meet the Ilkhanid army at Homs. In the 28 October battle of Homs, the Mamluks routed the Ilkhanids and confirmed Mamluk dominance in Syria. The defeat of the Ilkhanids enabled Qalawun to proceed against the remaining Crusader outposts in Syria. In May 1285, he captured the Marqab fortress and garrisoned it.\nQalawun's early reign was marked by policies intended to garner support from the merchant class, the Muslim bureaucracy and the religious establishment. Among these were the elimination of illegal taxes that burdened the merchants and extensive building and renovation projects for Islam's holiest sites, such as the Prophet's Mosque in Medina, the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. After the détente with the Ilkhanids, Qalawun ordered mass arrests to suppress internal dissent, imprisoning dozens of high-ranking emirs in Egypt and Syria. The détente coincided with a refocusing of Qalawun's building activities to more secular and personal purposes, including a large, multi-division hospital complex in Cairo. Construction of the hospital, a contrast from his Mamluk predecessors' focus on establishing madrasas, was intended to garner public goodwill, create a lasting legacy, and secure his spot in the afterlife. Its location facing al-Salih Ayyub's tomb demonstrated Qalawun's lasting connection to his master and honored the Salihiyya. While the Salihi mamluks were typically Kipchak Turks, Qalawun diversified mamluk ranks by purchasing numerous non-Turks, particularly Circassians, forming out of them the Burji regiment.\n\nQalawun was the last Salihi sultan and after his death in 1290, his son, al-Ashraf Khalil, drew his legitimacy as a mamluk by emphasizing his lineage from Qalawun. Like his predecessors, Khalil's main priorities were organization of the sultanate, defeat of the Crusaders and the Mongols, integration of Syria into the empire and preservation of the flows of new mamluks and weaponry. With regards to the last policy, Baybars had purchased 4,000 mamluks, Qalawun 6,000–7,000 and by the end of Khalil's reign, there was an estimated total of 10,000 mamluks in the sultanate. In 1291, Khalil captured Acre, the last major Crusader stronghold in Palestine and Mamluk rule consequently extended across all of Syria.\nKhalil's death in 1293 led to period of factional struggle, with Khalil's prepubescent brother, al-Nasir Muhammad, being overthrown the following year by a Mongol mamluk of Qalawun, al-Adil Kitbugha, who in turn was succeeded by a Greek mamluk of Qalawun, Husam ad-Din Lajin. To consolidate his control, Lajin attempted to redistribute iqtaʿat to his supporters. He was unable to retain the sultanate and al-Nasir Muhammad was restored to power in 1298, ruling over a fractious realm until being toppled by Baybars II, a Circassian mamluk of Qalawun, who was wealthier, and more pious and cultured than his immediate predecessors.\nEarly into al-Nasir Muhammad's second reign, the Ilkhanids, whose leader, Mahmud Ghazan, had converted to Islam, invaded Syria and routed a Mamluk army near Homs in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar in 1299. However, Ghazan withdrew most of his troops from Syria shortly after due to a lack of fodder for their numerous horses and the residual Ilkhanid force retreated in 1300 at the approach of the rebuilt Mamluk army. Another Ilkhanid invasion in 1303 was repelled after the Ilkhanid defeat at the Battle of Marj al-Suffar in the plains south of Damascus.\n\n\n=== Third reign of al-Nasir Muhammad ===\n\nBaybars II ruled for roughly one year before al-Nasir Muhammad became sultan again in 1310, this time ruling for over three decades in a period often considered by historians of the Mamluks to be the apex of both the Bahri regime specifically and the Mamluk Sultanate in general. To avoid the experiences of his previous two reigns where the mamluks of Qalawun and Khalil held sway and periodically assumed the sultanate, al-Nasir Muhammad began efforts to establish a centralized autocracy. Early into his reign, in 1310, al-Nasir Muhammad imprisoned, exiled or killed any Mamluk emirs that supported those who toppled him in the past, including the Burji mamluks. He then assigned emirates to over thirty of his own mamluks. Initially, al-Nasir Muhammad left most of his father's mamluks undisturbed, but in 1311 and 1316, he imprisoned and executed most of them, and again redistributed emirates to his own mamluks. By 1316, the number of mamluks in the sultanate decreased to 2,000. Al-Nasir Muhammad further consolidated power by replacing Caliph al-Mustakfi (r. 1302–1340) with his own appointee, al-Wathiq, as well as compelling the qadi (head judge) to issue legal rulings advancing his interests.\nAl-Nasir Muhammad being a son of a mamluk instead of a mamluk himself risked undermining his position among the largely mamluk elite. This partly explains his purges of the thousands of mamluks purchased by his predecessors. Amid conditions that stemmed the flow of mamluks from the Mongol-held lands to the sultanate, al-Nasir Muhammad resolved to compensate the reduction of mamluks by adopting new methods of training and military and financial advancement that introduced a great level of permissiveness. This manifested in significantly relaxed conditions for new mamluks and encouraged the pursuit of military careers in Egypt by aspiring mamluks outside of the empire, to the point that parents would sell their children to be mamluks so they would enjoy an improved standard of living.\n\nUnder al-Nasir Muhammad, the Mamluks successfully repelled an Ilkhanid invasion of Syria in 1313 and then concluded a peace treaty with the Ilkhanate in 1322, bringing a long-lasting end to the Mamluk-Mongol wars. After the détente, al-Nasir Muhammad ushered in a period of stability and prosperity in the sultanate through the enactment of major political, economic and military reforms ultimately intended to ensure his continued rule and consolidate the Qalawuni-Bahri regime. Concurrent with his reign was the disintegration of the Ilkhanate into several smaller dynastic states and the consequent Mamluk effort to establish diplomatic and commercial relationships with the new political entities. Al-Nasir Muhammad also attempted to assert permanent Mamluk control over the Makurian vassal state, launching an invasion in 1316 and installing a Muslim Nubian king, Abdallah Barshambu. The latter was overthrown by Kanz al-Dawla, who al-Nasir Muhammad temporarily ousted in a 1323/24 expedition.\n\n\n=== End of the Bahri regime ===\nAl-Nasir Muhammad died in 1341 and his rule was followed by a succession of his descendants in a period marked by political instability. Most of his successors, except for al-Nasir Hasan (r. 1347–1351, 1354–1361) and al-Ashraf Sha'ban (r. 1363–1367), were sultans in name only, with the patrons of the leading mamluk factions holding actual power. The first of al-Nasir Muhammad's sons to accede was al-Mansur Abu Bakr, who al-Nasir Muhammad designated his successor. However, al-Nasir Muhammad's senior aide, Qawsun, held real power and imprisoned and executed Abu Bakr and had al-Nasir Muhammad's infant son, al-Ashraf Kujuk, appointed instead. By January 1342, Qawsun and Kujuk were toppled, and the latter's half-brother, al-Nasir Ahmad of al-Karak, was declared sultan. Ahmad relocated to al-Karak and left a deputy to rule on his behalf in Cairo. This unorthodox arrangement, together with his seclusive and frivolous behavior and his execution of loyal partisans, ended with Ahmad's deposition and replacement by his half-brother al-Salih Isma'il in June 1342. Isma'il ruled until his death in August 1345, and was succeeded by his brother al-Kamil Sha'ban. The latter was killed in a mamluk revolt and was succeeded by his brother al-Muzaffar Hajji, who was also killed in a mamluk revolt in late 1347.\n\nAfter Hajji's death, the senior emirs of al-Nasir Muhammad hastily appointed another of his sons, the twelve-year-old al-Nasir Hasan. Coinciding with Hasan's first reign, in 1347–1348, the Bubonic Plague arrived in Egypt and other plagues followed, causing mass death in the country, which in turn led to major social and economic changes in the region. In 1351, in reaction to Hasan's attempted to assert executive power, the senior emirs, led by Emir Taz, ousted and replaced him with his brother, al-Salih Salih. The emirs Shaykhu and Sirghitmish deposed Salih and restored Hasan in a coup in 1355, after which Hasan gradually purged Taz, Shaykhu and Sirghitmish and their mamluks from his administration. Concurrently, Hasan began recruiting and promoting the awlad al-nas (descendants of mamluks who did not undergo the enslavement/manumission process) in the military and administration, a process that lasted for the remainder of the Bahri period. This caused resentment among Hasan's own mamluks, led by Emir Yalbugha al-Umari, who killed Hasan in 1361.\n\nYalbugha became the regent of Hasan's successor and the young son of the late sultan Hajji, al-Mansur Muhammad. By then, mamluk solidarity and loyalty to the emirs had dissipated. To restore discipline and unity within the Mamluk state and military, Yalbugha applied the rigorous educational methods used for mamluks during the reigns of sultans Baybars and Qalawun. In 1365, an attempt by the Mamluks to annex Armenia, which had since replaced Crusader Acre as the Christian commercial foothold of Asia, was stifled by an invasion of Alexandria by Peter I of Cyprus. The Mamluks concurrently experienced a deterioration of their lucrative position in international trade and the economy of the sultanate declined, further weakening the Bahri regime. Meanwhile, the harshness of Yalbugha's educational methods and his refusal to rescind his disciplinary reforms provoked a mamluk backlash. Yalbugha was subsequently killed by his own mamluks in an uprising in 1366. The rebellious mamluks were supported by Sultan al-Ashraf Sha'ban, who Yalbugha had installed in 1363. Sha'ban rule as the real power in the sultanate until 1377, when he was killed by mamluk dissidents on his way to Mecca to perform the Hajj.\n\n\n== Burji rule (1382-1517) ==\n\n\n=== Reign of Barquq ===\n\nSha'ban was succeeded by his seven-year-old son al-Mansur Ali, though the oligarchy of the senior emirs held the reins of power. Among the senior emirs who rose to prominence under Ali was Barquq, a Circassian mamluk of Yalbugha who was involved in Sha'ban's assassination, and Baraka, another of Yalbugha's mamluks. Barquq was made atabeg al-asakir in 1378, giving him command of the Mamluk army, which he used to oust Baraka in 1380. Afterward, he brought to Egypt his father Anas and many of his kinsmen, possibly in an attempt to establish a power base outside of the Mamluk establishment. Ali died in May 1381 and was succeeded by his nine-year-old brother, al-Salih Hajji but power was in the hands of Barquq, al-Salih Hajji's regent; Barquq had tried to succeed Ali as sultan, but his bid was vetoed by the other senior emirs. Nonetheless, the next year, Barquq toppled al-Salih Hajji with the backing of Yalbugha's mamluks and assumed the throne, adopting the title of Baybars, al-Malik az-Zahir.\nBarquq's accession was enabled by the support of Yalbugha's mamluks, whose subsequent rise to power also made Barquq's position vulnerable. His rule was challenged in Syria in 1389 during a revolt by the Mamluk governor of Malatya, Mintash, and the governor of Aleppo, Yalbugha al-Nasiri, a former mamluk of both al-Nasir Hasan and Yalbugha al-Umari. The rebels took over Syria and headed for Egypt, prompting Barquq to abdicate in favor of al-Salih Hajji. The alliance between Yalbugha al-Nasiri and Mintash soon fell apart and factional fighting ensued in Cairo ending with Mintash ousting Yalbugha. Barquq was arrested and exiled to al-Karak where he rallied support for his return to power. In Cairo, Barquq's loyalists took over the citadel and arrested al-Salih Hajji. This paved the way for Barquq's usurpation of the sultanate once more in February 1390, firmly establishing the Burji regime. The ruling Mamluks of this period were generally of Circassian origin, drawn from the Christian population of the northern Caucasus. The name Burji, meaning 'of the tower', refers to the traditional residence of these mamluks in the barracks of the Citadel of Cairo.\n\nBarquq solidified his power in 1393, when his forces killed the major opponent to his rule, Mintash, in Syria. Barquq oversaw the mass recruitment of Circassians (estimated at 5,000 recruits) into the mamluk ranks and the restoration of the Mamluk state's authority throughout its realm in the tradition of the early Mamluk sultans, Baybars and Qalawun. A major innovation to this system by Barquq was the division of Egypt into three niyabat (sing. niyaba; provinces) similar to the administrative divisions in Syria. The new Egyptian niyabat were Alexandria, Damanhur and Asyut. Barquq instituted this change to better control the Egyptian countryside from the rising strength of the Bedouin tribes.  To that end, Barquq dispatched the Berber Hawwara tribesmen of the Nile Delta to Upper Egypt to check the Arab Bedouins.\nDuring Barquq's reign, in 1387, the Mamluks forced the Anatolian entity in Sivas to become a Mamluk vassal state. Towards the end of the 14th century, challengers to the Mamluks emerged in Anatolia, including the Ottoman dynasty who absorbed the territory of the Karamanids in central Anatolia and installed a vassal as the leader of the Dulkadirids in 1399, and the Turkic allies of Timur, the Aq Qoyonlu and Kara Qoyounlu tribes who entered southern and eastern Anatolia during the same period. Barquq clashed with Timur at the Euphrates in 1394 and Timur withdrew during that episode.\n\n\n=== Crises and restoration of state power ===\n\nBarquq died in 1399 and was succeeded by his eleven-year-old son, al-Nasir Faraj, who was in Damascus at the time. In that same year, Timur invaded Syria, sacking Aleppo before proceeding to sack Damascus. The latter had been abandoned by Faraj and his late father's entourage, who left for Cairo. Timur ended his occupation of Syria in 1402 to pursue his war against the Ottomans in Anatolia, whom he deemed a more dangerous threat to his rule. Faraj held onto power during this turbulent period, which, in addition to Timur's devastating raids the rise of Turkic tribes in the Jazira, and attempts by Barquq's emirs to topple Faraj, also saw a famine in Egypt in 1403, a severe plague in 1405 and a Bedouin revolt that practically ended Mamluk control of Upper Egypt between 1401 and 1413. Thus, Mamluk authority throughout the sultanate was significantly eroded, while the capital Cairo experienced an economic crisis.\nFaraj was toppled in 1412 by the Syria-based emirs, Tanam, Jakam, Nawruz and al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh, against whom Faraj had sent seven military expeditions during his reign. The emirs could not usurp the throne themselves, and had Caliph al-Musta'in (r. 1406–1413) installed as sultan; the caliph had the support of the non-Circassian mamluks and legitimacy with the local population. Six months later, Shakyh eased al-Musta'in out of power after neutralizing his main rival, Nawruz, and assumed the sultanate. Shaykh's main policy was restoring the state's authority within the empire, which experienced further plagues in 1415–1417 and 1420. Shaykh reestablished the state's fiscal administration to replenish the treasury by launching tax collection expeditions akin to raids throughout the empire to compensate the tax arrears under Faraj's reign. Shaykh also commissioned and led military expeditions against the Mamluks' enemies in Anatolia, reasserting the state's influence in that region.\n\n\n=== Reign of Barsbay ===\n\nBefore Shaykh died in 1421, he attempted to offset the power of the Circassian mamluks by importing Turkish mamluks and installing a Turk as atabeg al-asakir in 1420 to serve as regent for his infant son Ahmad. However, following his death, a Circassian emir, Tatar, married Shaykh's widow, ousted the atabeg al-asakir and assumed power. Tatar died three months into his reign and was succeeded by Barsbay, another Circassian emir of Barquq, in 1422. Under Barsbay, the Mamluk Sultanate reached its greatest territorial extent and was militarily dominant throughout the region, but his legacy was mixed in the eyes of contemporary commentators who criticized his fiscal methods and economic policies.\nBarsbay pursued an economic policy of establishing state monopolies over the lucrative trade with Europe, particularly regarding spices, to the chagrin of the civilian merchants of the sultanate. European merchants were forced to buy spices from state agents who set prices that maximized revenue rather than promoting market competition. This monopoly over the spice trade set a precedent for his successors, some of whom established state monopolies over other goods such as sugar and textiles. Moreover, Barsbay compelled Red Sea traders to offload their goods at the Mamluk-held Hejazi port of Jeddah rather than the Yemeni port of Aden in order to derive the most financial benefit from the Red Sea transit route to Europe. Barsbay's efforts at monopolization and trade protection were meant to offset the severe financial losses of the agricultural sector due to the frequent recurring plagues that took a heavy toll on the farmers. In the long term, the monopoly over the spice trade had a negative effect on Egyptian commerce and became a motivation for European merchants to seek alternative routes to the east around Africa and across the Atlantic.\nBarsbay also undertook efforts to better protect the caravan routes to the Hejaz from Bedouin raids and the Egyptian Mediterranean coast from Catalan and Genoese piracy. With regards to European pirates, he launched campaigns against Cyprus in 1425–1426, during which the island's Lusignan king, Janus, was taken captive, because of his alleged assistance to the pirates; the large ransoms paid to the Mamluks by the Cypriots allowed them to mint new gold coinage for the first time since the 14th century. Janus was forced to become Barsbay's vassal, an arrangement that was also enforced on his successors for several decades after.\nAfter the victories in Cyprus, Barsbay became concerned with growing Timurid influence over the Hejaz and its holy sites. On several occasions, Shah Rukh, Timur's son and successor, seized the privilege of providing the Kiswa (mantle) that was draped over the Kaaba shrine in Mecca every year, a prerogative of the Mamluk sultan since the time of Baybars. Barsbay challenged this in 1434, convening the four senior qadis of Cairo to discuss Shah Rukh's presumption. The Hanafi judge sided against Shah Rukh and the other three refrained from issuing judgements, which Barsbay took as a validation of the Mamluk position. He reasserted Cairo's prerogative to send to Kiswa, though an exchange of letters on the matter with Shah Rukh grew increasingly antagonistic. During his reign he reduced the independence of the Sharifs of Mecca to a minimum, sent Mamluk troops to occupy the Hejaz and to rein in local tribes, and took direct control of most of the region's administration.\nBarsbay launched military expeditions against the Aq Qoyonlu in 1429 and 1433. In the first expedition Edessa was sacked and its Muslim inhabitants massacred in retaliation for the Aq Qoyonlu's raids against the Mamluks' Jaziran territories. The second expedition was against the Aq Qoyonlu capital of Amid, which ended with the Aq Qoyonlu recognizing Mamluk suzerainty. Barsbay may have also feared an alliance between Shah Rukh, the Ottomans, and other regional states in the area. Janibak al-Sufi, a Mamluk who had originally opposed Barsbay's rise to power and had fled to Anatolia, was also a serious threat in this regard and rekindled concerns over unrest to the north. Barsbay sent an expedition that defeated Janibak near Ayntab (present-day Gaziantep) in July 1436 and advanced as far as Erzincan. Janibak escaped, but was eventually deemed a liability by his allies and died a prisoner in 1437, ending any further threats to Barsbay from the north.\nWhile the Mamluks succeeded in forcing the Anatolian beyliks to largely submit to their suzerainty, Mamluk authority in Upper Egypt was mostly relegated to the emirs of the Hawwara tribe. The latter had grown wealthy from their burgeoning trade with central Africa and achieved a degree of local popularity due to their piety, education and generally benign treatment of the inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Successors of Barsbay ===\nBarsbay died on 7 June 1438 after suffering from the plague over several months. Per his wishes, his fourteen-year-old son, Yusuf, was officially installed as his successor that same day and one of his senior emirs, Sayf ad-Din Jaqmaq, was appointed his regent. The usual disputes over succession ensued and after three months Jaqmaq won and became sultan, exiling Yusuf to Alexandria.\n\nJaqmaq was a mamluk recruited by Barquq and was already 65 years old when he came to power. He had survived the preceding period by avoiding conflict and making few enemies, an attitude that continued into his reign. He maintained friendly relations with the Ottomans and, departing from Barsbay's forceful approach, allowed Shah Rukh to dispatch the mahmal (ceremonial litter) on the pilgrimage caravan to Mecca in 1444. His most important foreign military effort was an unsuccessful campaign to conquer Rhodes from the Knights of St. John, involving three expeditions between 1440 and 1444.\nDomestically, Jaqmaq largely continued Barsbay's monopolies, though he promised to enact reforms and formally rescinded some tariffs. He continued to extort for financial gain but made a show of his piety and sought to frame all his actions within the mechanisms of Islamic law. When he died on 13 February 1453, he was well-respected by much of the population and was publicly mourned. Afterward, Jaqmaq's eighteen-year-old son, al-Mansur Uthman, was installed on the throne but soon lost all support when he tried to buy the loyalty of other mamluks with debased coins.\nSayf ad-Din Inal, who Barsbay had made his atabeg al-asakir in 1446, eventually won enough support to be declared sultan two months after Jaqmaq's death. Inal came to power at the age of 73. He was the last Mamluk sultan who began his career as a mamluk of Barquq and, unlike many predecessors, he had distinguished himself under previous sultans without ever being arrested.\nInal was sultan when Mehmed II, the Ottoman sultan, conquered Constantinople in 1453. An Ottoman embassy arrived in Cairo on 27 October 1453 to bring the news, after which Inal ordered lavish public celebrations to commemorate the event, much like the celebrations of a Mamluk victory. It is unclear whether Inal and the other mamluks understood the implications of this event, though they likely received the news with mixed feelings. This marked the rise of the Ottomans as a superpower, a status that brought them into increasing conflict with the Mamluk Sultanate, which grew more stagnant.\nIn Cyprus, Inal became embroiled in a succession dispute within the Lusignan dynasty on the island, still vassals of the Mamluks. John II, the son and successor of Janus, died in 1458 and the succession was disputed between his legitimate daughter, Charlotte, and his illegitimate son, James. The latter arrived in Cairo in May 1459 to request Inal's aid. The sultan agreed and began preparations for an expedition to the island to enforce his claim, but in March 1460 an embassy from Charlotte arrived and bribed Inal and his emirs into endorsing her claim instead. When James learned of this seeming betrayal, his supporters convinced Inal's emirs to reverse to their original position with an even larger bribe. Inal was finally convinced to reaffirm the claim of James. A military expedition was sent to the island, defeated Charlotte, and installed James as king.\nInal's behaviour during this episode was noted by contemporary observers as evidence of his unsteady policies. His willingness to accept the highest bribe reflected the state's severe financial difficulties. The ruling class tried to raise funds by selling offices and judge positions to individuals willing to buy them. The state's iqta properties were also sold off in return for military service, depriving the treasury of the tax revenues collected on these lands. Coins based on precious metals nearly disappeared from circulation.\nInal died on 26 February 1461. His son, al-Mu'ayyad Ahmad, was promptly installed as his successor and then promptly challenged by Janam al-Ashrafi, the governor of Damascus, and Janibak al-Zahiri, the governor of Jeddah. Eventually the Mamluks settled on a compromise candidate, Khushqadam al-Mu'ayyadi. Ahmad was exiled to Alexandria. Khushqadam was initially considered a temporary choice because he was not a Circassian (he was a possibly of Greek origin) but he outplayed his rivals. Janam was bribed at first and then alienated. He fled and sought help from Uzun Hasan, the Aq-Qoyunlu ruler, but died on a campaign near Edessa in 1462, before he could cause further trouble. Janibak was assassinated in August 1463.\nKhushqadam's reign was marked by further political difficulties abroad and domestically. Cyprus remained a vassal, but Khushqadam's representative was killed in battle after insulting James II (who had been installed by Inal). In the Dulkadirid principality to the north, a succession dispute saw a Mamluk-backed candidate defeated by Shah Suwar, the candidate supported by the Ottomans. Closer to home, Bedouin Arab tribes were restless and the sultan had to send his forces against the Labid tribe in the Nile Delta region and against the Hawwara in Upper Egypt, with little effect.\n\n\n=== Reign of Qaytbay ===\n\nKhushqadam died on 9 October 1467 and the mamluk emirs initially installed Yalbay al-Mu'ayyadi as his successor. After two months he was replaced by Timurbugha al-Zahiri. Timurbugha was deposed in turn on 31 January 1468, but voluntarily consented to the accession of his second in command, Qaytbay. Qaytbay was a Circassian purchased in 1435 or 1436 by a slave merchant, then recruited by Barsbay's agents in Cairo, and manumitted by Jaqmaq. Under Inal and Khushqadam, he rose through the ranks. Timurbugha, during his brief rule, appointed him as his atabeg. After he was installed as sultan, Qaytbay granted Timurbugha's request to retire peacefully in Damietta. Qaytbay's 28-year-long reign, the second longest in Mamluk history after al-Nasir Muhammad, was marked by relative stability and prosperity. Historical sources present a sultan whose character was markedly different from other Mamluk rulers. Notably, he disliked engaging in conspiracy, even though this had been a hallmark of Mamluk politics. He had a reputation for being even-handed and treating his colleagues and subordinates fairly, examplified by his magnanimous treatment of the deposed Timurbugha. These traits seem to have kept internal tensions and conspiracies at bay throughout his reign. While the Mamluk practices of confiscation, extortion, and bribery continued in fiscal matters, under Qaytbay they were practiced in a more systematic way that allowed individuals and institutions to function within a more predictable environment. His engagement with the civil bureaucracy and the ulema (Islamic jurists and scholars) appeared to reflect a genuine commitment to Sunni Islamic law. He was one of the most prolific Mamluk patrons of architecture, second only to al-Nasir Muhammad, and his patronage of religious and civic buildings extended to the provinces beyond Cairo. Nonetheless, Qaytbay operated in an environment of recurring plague epidemics that underpinned a general population decline. Agriculture suffered, the treasury was often stretched thin, and by the end of his reign the economy was still weak.\n\nThe challenges to Mamluk dominance abroad were also mounting, particularly to the north. Shah Suwar, the leader of the Dulkadirid principality in Anatolia, benefited from Ottoman support and was an excellent military tactician. Meanwhile, Qaytbay supported the ruler of the Karamanid principality, Ahmad. Initially, the Mamluks failed in a series of campaigns against Shah Suwar. The tide turned in 1470–1471 when an agreement was reached between Qaytbay and Mehmed II, by which Qaytbay stopped supporting the Karamanids and the Ottomans stopped supporting the Dulkadirids. Now without Ottoman support, Shah Suwar was defeated in 1471 by a Mamluk expedition led by Qaytbay's senior field commander, Yashbak min Mahdi. Shah Suwar held out in his fortress near Zamantı, before agreeing to surrender himself if his life was spared and he was allowed to remain as a vassal. In the end, Qaytbay was unwilling to let him live and Shah Suwar was betrayed, brought to Cairo, and executed. Shah Budaq was installed as his replacement and as a Mamluk vassal, though the Ottoman-Mamluk rivalry over the Dulkadirid throne continued.\nThe next challenge to Qaytbay was the rise of the Aq Qoyunlu leader Uzun Hasan. The latter led an expedition into Mamluk territory around Aleppo in 1472, but was routed by Yashbak. The next year, Uzun Hassan was more resoundingly defeated in battle against Mehmed II near Erzurum. His son and successor, Ya'qub, resorted to inviting Yashbak min Mahdi to participate in a campaign against Edessa. As this avoided any challenge against Qaytbay's authority, Yashbak accepted. Although initially successful, he was killed during the siege of the city, thus depriving Qaytbay of his most important field commander.\nIn 1489, the Republic of Venice annexed Cyprus. The Venetians promised Qaytbay their occupation would benefit him as well, as their large fleet than could better keep the peace in the eastern Mediterranean than the Cypriots. Venice also agreed to continue the Cypriots' yearly tribute of 8,000 ducats to Cairo. A treaty signed between the two powers in 1490 formalized this arrangement. It was a sign that the Mamluks were now depending partly on the Venetians for naval security.\n\n\n==== First confrontation with the Ottomans ====\n\nWith the death of Mehmed II in 1481 and the accession of his son, Bayezid II, to the Ottoman throne, Ottoman-Mamluk tensions escalated. Bayezid's claim to the throne was challenged by his brother, Jem. The latter fled into exile and Qaytbay granted him sanctuary in Cairo in September 1481. Qaytbay eventually allowed him to return to Anatolia to lead a new attempt against Bayezid. This venture failed and Jem was fled into exile again, this time into Christian hands to the west. Bayezid interpreted Qaytbay's welcome to Jem as direct support for the latter's cause and was furious. Qaytbay also supported the Dulkadirid leader, Ala al-Dawla (who had replaced Shah Budaq), against the Ottomans, but Ala al-Dawla was compelled to shift his loyalty to Bayezid c. 1483 or 1484, which soon triggered the start of an Ottoman–Mamluk war over the next six years.\n\nIn the spring of 1484, a combined Dulkadirid and Ottoman force captured Malatya. After further reverses, the Mamluk army ambushed and defeated the attackers near Malatya in September 1484. Qaytbay sent an envoy, Janibak Habib, to Istanbul to negotiate a peace in 1485, but to no avail. Over several years, Ottoman advances into Cilicia were met with Mamluk counterattacks that generally reversed their gains but failed to end the war decisively. In February 1486, the Mamluk commander, Azbak, scored a major victory. In response, Bayezid sent a larger force led by Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha, his father-in-law and the beylerbey of Anatolia, but the latter was defeated and captured by Azbak near Adana in March 1486.\nIn the spring of 1487, a new Ottoman campaign led by Grand Vizier Davud Pasha advanced into the region, reoccupying Adana. Qaytbay, realizing that the Ottomans could reconstitute a large army even after suffering major defeats, resolved to send a huge, well-armed expedition to force a more decisive outcome. The Mamluk army, led by Azbak, left Cairo in late May 1488. An Ottoman fleet attempted to land near a coastal fortress at Bab al-Malik but was repelled by Azbak. The decisive encounter occurred near Adana in August 1488, in the Battle of Aga-Cayiri. Over two days, both sides suffered heavy casualties, but the Ottomans lost many members of their chain of command and were eventually forced into a rout. Adana held out for three months longer, but Azbak returned triumphant to Cairo in February or March 1489.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the Ottomans sent a peace overture which arrived in Cairo in May 1489, but Qaytbay rejected it. The Ottomans again sent another army that advanced into southeastern Anatolia in late 1489. Though the Mamluks struggled to finance their war efforts, Azbak led another expedition from Cairo in March 1490. The Ottomans refrained from attacking the Mamluks directly and Azbak pursued them into central Anatolia, with confrontations occurring near Kayseri. The Mamluks pillaged the region until October 1490, when Azbak, pressured by his troops and fearing a possible Ottoman trap, opted to turn back—a decision that soured his relationship with Qaytbay. By 1491, both sides were exhausted and an Ottoman embassy arrived in Cairo in the spring. An agreement was concluded and the status quo ante bellum was reaffirmed. During the rest of Qaytbay's reign, no further external conflicts took place.\n\n\n=== Reign of al-Ghuri ===\n\nQaytbay's death on 8 August 1496 inaugurated several years of instability. His son, Muhammad, succeeded him but was assassinated on 31 October 1498. He was succeeded by his maternal uncle, al-Zahir Qansuh, who was driven out by al-Adil Tuman Bay in June 1500. Tuman Bay initially accepted Janbalat as sultan instead, but later proclaimed himself sultan while suppressing a revolt near Damascus and returned to force him out, taking power in January 1501. Three months later, he was deposed and replaced by Qansuh al-Ghuri (or al-Ghawri), his second in command. Al-Ghuri had stayed relatively uninvolved in Mamluk politics and initially refused to accept what he considered a dangerous position. He only agreed after multiple assurances were given and after Tuman Bay was executed.\nAl-Ghuri secured his position over several months and appointed new figures to key posts. His nephew, Tuman Bay (not to be confused with al-Adil Tuman Bay) was appointed dawadar and his second in command. In Syria, al-Ghuri appointed Sibay, a former rival who opposed him in 1504–1505, as governor of Damascus in 1506. The latter remained a major figure during his reign but he acknowledged Cairo's suzerainty and helped to keep the peace.\nAl-Ghuri is often viewed negatively by historical commentators, particularly Ibn Iyas, for his draconic fiscal policies. The sultan inherited a state beset by financial problems. In addition to the demographic and economic changes under his predecessors, changes in the organisation of the Mamluk military over time had also resulted in large numbers of soldiers feeling alienated and repeatedly threatening to revolt unless given extra payments, which drained the state's finances. To address the shortfalls, al-Ghuri resorted to heavy-handed and far-reaching taxation and extortion to refill the treasury, which elicited protests that were sometimes violent. He used the raised funds to repair fortresses throughout the region, to commission his own construction projects in Cairo, and to purchase a large number of new mamluks to fill his military ranks.\nAl-Ghuri also attempted reforms of the Mamluk military. He recognized the impact of gunpowder technology used by the Ottomans and Europeans, but which the Mamluks had eschewed. In 1507, he established a foundry to produce cannons and created a new regiment trained to use them, known as the 'Fifth Corps' (al-Ṭabaqa al-Khamisa). The latter's ranks were filled recruits from outside the traditional mamluk system, including Turkmens, Persians, awlad al-nas, and craftsmen. The traditional mamluk army, however, regarded firearms with contempt and vigorously resisted their incorporation into Mamluk warfare, which prevented al-Ghuri from making effective use of them until the end of his reign.\nIn the meantime, Shah Ismail I had emerged in 1501 and forged the Safavid Empire in Iran. The Safavids styled themselves as champions of Twelver Shi'ism, in direct opposition to the Sunnism of the Mamluks and Ottomans. In 1508, Ismail captured Baghdad, threatening the eastern frontier of the Mamluk and Ottoman empires. In 1510, Safavid and Venetian envoys on their way to Iran were captured by the Mamluks near Aleppo, allegedly with evidence that the Safavids had proposed an anti-Mamluk alliance with Venice. This soured Venetian-Mamluk relations. Tensions were exacerbated when Rhodes attacked and destroyed a Turkish fleet carrying naval supplies and timber to the Mamluks. Al-Ghuri held the Venetians partly responsible and responded by impounding all Venetian goods in the Mamluk Sultanate. Eventually, the Venetians persuaded him to reopen trade in 1512 and resume normal relations. These events encouraged al-Ghuri to rely more on the Ottomans for aid, a policy that the Venetians ultimately also urged him to follow in order to counter their common foe, the Portuguese.\n\n\n==== Portuguese expansion ====\n\nOne of the major concerns of al-Ghuri's time was the Portuguese expansion into the Indian Ocean. In 1498, the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama circumnavigated Africa and reached India, thus opening a new route for European trade with the east which bypassed the Middle East. This posed a serious threat to Muslim commerce, which was dominant in the area, as well as to the prosperity of Venice, which relied on trade passing from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean through Mamluk lands. The Portuguese expeditions returning from India in the next few years drew enormous profits, while the Venetians saw their share of the goods from the east diminishing rapidly at the same time.\nAs resistance to their presence mounted, the Portuguese aimed to seize control of the Indian Ocean trade route by force. They occupied the island of Socotra in an attempt to control access to the Red Sea. The Venetians encouraged al-Ghuri to confront the Portuguese in defense of their mutual interests. The Mamluk sultan requested Venetian aid in building and supplying a fleet of ships in the Gulf of Suez. There is also evidence that the Ottomans began supplying the Mamluks with building materials for the construction and armament of a fleet from 1507 onward. A Mamluk fleet of fifty ships gathered at Jeddah in 1506 under the direction of the Mamluk governor there, Mir Hussein, and with assistance of forces from the Gujarat Sultanate, led by Malik Ayyaz. In 1507 they defeated the Portuguese, who were led by Francisco de Almeida and his son Lourenço, off the western coast of India. The Portuguese regained their dominance upon defeating a Mamluk and Gujarati fleet at the Battle of Diu in 1509.\nThe Portuguese, led by Afonso de Albuquerque, attacked Aden unsuccessfully in 1513, but then captured Hormuz in 1515. In the meantime, with Ottoman aid, the Mamluks were building a new fleet in the Gulf of Suez. In 1515, a joint Ottoman-Mamluk fleet, under the leadership of Salman Ra'is, finally left for the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Ultimately, it did not accomplish much. When the fleet returned to Egypt in 1517, they learned that Cairo had fallen to the Ottomans and Salman Ra'is allegedly threw his Mamluk co-commander overboard.\n\n\n=== Fall to the Ottomans ===\n\nSelim I, the new Ottoman sultan, defeated the Safavids decisively at the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514. Soon after, he attacked and defeated the Dulkadirids, a Mamluk vassal, for refusing to aid him against the Safavids. Secure now against Ismail I, in 1516 he drew together a great army aiming at conquering Egypt, but to obscure the fact he presented the mobilisation of his army as being part of the war against Ismail I. The war started in 1516 which led to the later incorporation of Egypt and its dependencies in the Ottoman Empire, with Mamluk cavalry proving no match for the Ottoman artillery and the janissaries. On 24 August 1516, at the Battle of Marj Dabiq, the Ottomans were victorious against an army led by al-Ghuri himself. Khayr Bak, the governor of Aleppo, had secretly conspired with Selim and betrayed al-Ghuri, leaving with his troops part-way during the battle. In the subsequent chaos, al-Ghuri was killed. The surviving Mamluk forces returned to Aleppo but were denied entry to the city and marched back to Egypt, harassed along the way. Syria passed into Ottoman possession, and the Ottomans were welcomed in many places as deliverance from the Mamluks.\nThe Mamluk Sultanate survived a little longer until 1517. Tuman Bay, whom al-Ghuri had left as deputy in Cairo, was hastily and unanimously proclaimed sultan on 10 October 1516. The emirs rejected his plan to confront the next Ottoman advance at Gaza, so instead he prepared a final defense at al-Raydaniyya to the north of Cairo. In the early days of 1517, Tuman Bay received news that a Mamluk army was defeated at Gaza. The Ottoman attack at al-Raydaniyya overwhelmed the defenders on 22 January 1517 and reached Cairo. Over the following days, furious fighting continued between Mamluks, locals, and Ottomans, resulting in much damage to the city and three days of pillaging. Selim proclaimed an amnesty on 31 January, at which point many of the remaining Mamluks surrendered. Tuman Bay fled to Bahnasa in Middle Egypt with some of his remaining forces.\nSelim initially offered the Mamluk sultan peace as an Ottoman vassal, but his messengers were intercepted and killed by mamluks. Tuman Bay, with 4,000 cavalry and some 8,000 infantry, confronted the Ottomans in a final bloody battle near Giza on 2 April 1517, where he was defeated and captured. Selim intended to spare him, but Khayr Bak and Janbirdi al-Ghazali, another former Mamluk commander, persuaded the Ottoman sultan that Tuman Bay was too dangerous to keep alive. Accordingly, the last Mamluk sultan was executed by hanging at Bab Zuwayla, one of Cairo's gates, on 13 April 1517. In reward for his betrayal at Marj Dabiq, Selim installed Khayr Bak as Ottoman governor of Egypt. Janbirdi was appointed governor of Damascus.\n\n\n== Mamluks under Ottoman rule ==\n\nWhile the Mamluk Sultanate ceased to exist with the Ottoman conquest and the recruitment of Royal Mamluks ended, the mamluks as a military-social class continued to exist. They constituted a \"self-perpetuating, largely Turkish-speaking warrior class\" that continued to influence politics under Ottoman rule. They existed as military units in parallel with the more strictly Ottoman regiments like the janissaries and the azabs. The difference between these Ottoman regiments and the Egyptian mamluk regiments became blurred over time as intermarriage became common, resulting in a more mixed social class.\n\nDuring this period, a number of mamluk 'households' formed, with a complex composition including both true mamluks and awlad al-nas, who could also rise to high ranks. Each household was headed by an ustadh, who could be an Ottoman officer or a local civilian. Their patronage extended to include retainers recruited from other Ottoman provinces as well as allies among the local urban population and tribes. Up to the early 17th century, the vast majority of Egyptian mamluks were still of Caucasian or Circassian origin. In the later 17th and 18th centuries, mamluks from other parts of the Ottoman Empire or its frontiers, such as Bosnia and Georgia, began to appear in Egypt.\nThroughout the Ottoman period, powerful mamluk households and factions struggled for control of important political offices and of Egypt's revenues. Between 1688 and 1755, mamluk beys, allied with Bedouin and factions within the Ottoman garrison, deposed at least thirty-four governors. The mamluks remained a dominating force in Egyptian politics until their final elimination at the hands of Muhammad Ali in 1811.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAmitai, Reuven (2006). \"The Logistics of the Mamluk-Mongol War, with Special Reference to the Battle of Wadi'l-Khaznadar, 1299 C.E.\".

        "content": "Francisco Antonio Barbastro (1735–1800) was a Franciscan missionary in New Spain.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBarbastro was born in 1735 in Cariñena, Aragon, and arrived in the College of Santa Cruz de Querétaro in 1770. He was assigned to Mission San Miguel de Ures in 1773,: 41  and to Mission San Pedro y San Pablo del Tubutama in 1776 and from 1778 to 1783.\nIn 1777, Barbastro became president of the missions of the Pimería Alta, a position he held until 1795. In 1784, he was assigned to Mission Nuestra Señora de los Remedios de Banámichi, and succeeded Sebastián Flores as custos of San Carlos de Sonora; his efforts were instrumental to its 1791 abolition.  By 1787, Barbastro was in Mission San Pedro Aconchi, where he remained until his death on June 22, 1800.\n\n\n== Missionary work ==\nBarbastro was fluent in the Opata and Pima languages. Historian John L. Kessell describes him as a \"champion of Indian aptitude\", who believed that the natives were capable of learning and had the same native talents as the Spanish settlers.\nBarbastro opposed the efforts of Bishop Antonio de los Reyes to subordinate the missions to the newly created Diocese of Sonora.: 37  The conflict escalated, with complaints, appeals, and litigation on both sides; on March 13, 1785, de los Reyes imprisoned and questioned Barbastro. Barbastro was released soon after, but the animosity continued until de los Reyes's death in 1787.: 210–212 \nIn letters to his fellow missionaries, Barbastro defended Franciscan management of mission property, arguing that barter or payments through an intermediary did not violate the Franciscan vow of poverty. He also instructed that the church should be the first to benefit from native labor, with native widows, orphans, and invalids receiving aid only if surplus remained thereafter.: 200–201 \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Polish Publishing House R. Wegner (Polish: Wydawnictwo Polskie R. Wegnera) was a Polish publishing house active from 1917 to 1950. It was founded as a joint-stock company by Rudolf Wegner as Polish Publishing House (Polish: Wydawnictwo Polskie), headquartered in Lviv, and later in Poznań. In 1926, Wegner took over ownership and changed the name to Polish Publishing House R. Wegner. It was mainly focused on Polish and foreign literature. It had a number of publishing series, the most famous being the Nobel Laureates Library and Wonders of Poland. It was characterized by great attention to the technical, literary, and graphic quality of its books, especially luxury bibliophile editions. The production output reached 300 new titles annually. During World War II, it was relocated to Warsaw and sold its warehouse stocks. In 1941, the owner, Rudolf Wegner, passed away, and the company passed into the hands of his wife, Wanda, and daughter, Irena Rybotycka. The assets of the publishing house were practically completely destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising. After the war, it resumed operations, but in 1950, it was nationalized and liquidated. Its activity was continued on a relatively small scale by the emigrant Tern (Rybitwa) Book Polish Publishing House in London until the 1970s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From 1901 to 1914: origins ===\nRudolf Wegner began his publishing activity by founding a partnership with Zygmunt Rychliński in 1901 and acquiring a bookstore on Piotrkowska Street in Łódź, which was a branch of the Gebethner i Wolff publishing house. The company conducted intensive publishing activities, offering scientific and popular science books, textbooks, sheet music, fiction, as well as magazines such as the humorous Łodzianka and the professional Czasopismo Lekarskie. In 1905, Wegner, probably due to political reasons (suspicions by the authorities of involvement in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and distribution of books outside censorship), had to immediately leave the territory of the Russian partition. He settled in Lviv and started working at the Altenberg and Ossolineum publishing houses.\n\n\n=== From 1917 to 1928: Polish Publishing House ===\nIn 1917, Wegner formed a joint-stock company, whose shareholders included Ignacy Mościcki, Antoni Jakubski, Marian Kukiel, Tadeusz Kutrzeba, Roman Odzierzyński, and Aleksander Litwinowicz. The capital obtained allowed the establishment of the Polish Publishing House in November 1917, with Wegner as its director. The headquarters of the new publishing house was established in Lviv at 15 Zyblikiewicza Street. In 1920, Wegner moved it to Poznań, initially to premises at 5 Wolności Square, lent by Jan Jachowski, and then to 48 Święty Marcin Street. In the Polish Booksellers' Association, the publishing house was registered at 6 Zwierzyniecka Street.\nPoznań was a calm city, much less destroyed by the war than Lviv and Warsaw, with a well-developed printing and publishing industry. In these conditions, Wegner led the company to rapid development. Close cooperation was established with Stanisław Wasylewski. From 1920, publishing series began to appear. In 1921, Stanisław Lam became the manager and literary advisor of the publishing house. The first volume of the largest series of the publishing house, the Library of Nobel Laureates, was published at that time. The publishing house intensified its activities, gradually reaching a level of about 300 titles per year. Its production was presented, among others, at the book exhibition in Poznań (1924) and the 2nd International Book Exhibition in Florence (1925). In 1926, Stanisław Wasylewski took over the editing of the Library of Nobel Laureates, and a year later, he became the editor of the publishing house.\n\n\n=== From 1939 to 1945: World War II ===\nAfter the Germans occupied Poznań in 1939, Wegner's publishing house was closed by the occupation authorities, and the owner was expelled from Poznań. The books from the publishing house's warehouses in Poznań and Lviv were earmarked for destruction by the occupiers. Valuable private collections were burned by the Germans in the Wolności Square in Poznań.\nWegner settled in Warsaw and continued his activities under the name Polish Publishing House R. Wegner. First, he undertook efforts to save the publishing house's resources in Poznań. Initial attempts, including those by the bookseller and publisher Gustaw Tetzlaw, failed. Wegner then sought help from Stefan Szpinger, who had previously successfully organized the transportation of collections from the Poznań Printing House and Bookstore of St. Adalbert to Warsaw by rail. All materials from the warehouse of Polish Publishing House were requisitioned by the Germans and haphazardly transferred to a railway warehouse. The entire stock was seized by the German Bank, which took over the pre-war credit of the publishing house. Wegner managed to quickly repay the entire debt, regaining the ability to dispose of the warehouse's resources, and Szpinger, with great difficulty, obtained approvals from the Propaganda Abteilung, Presse Amt, and Gestapo for the removal of books. A condition imposed by the Gestapo was Szpinger's personal commitment to organize the collections after transportation to Warsaw and to hand over to the German authorities the titles listed as banned books. The transport to Warsaw was carried out by the transportation company C. Hartwig.\nIn addition to the warehouse resources, Wegner had substantial stocks of books ready for sale in the basement of his house on Słowacki Street, which, coincidentally, escaped the attention of the Germans. Szpinger organized a group of friendly booksellers from the Bookstore of St. Adalbert to pack the hidden books and then conducted a daring operation to transport them (also with the help of C. Hartwig) to the railway warehouse and mostly include them in the transport to Warsaw. Part of the stock was allocated for sale in Poznań, obtaining funds to cover the Poznań expenses related to the operation (Wegner's funds from Warsaw could not be used for this purpose, as the transport of cash from the General Government to the Reich territories was prohibited). In total, about 300 tons of books, loose printer's sheets, and supplies of clean paper were transported from Poznań, occupying 15 railway wagons. In this venture, Szpinger was assisted by Julian Stefański, Teodor Bielawski, and Stefan Szczypiński, as well as volunteer booksellers from the Bookstore of St. Adalbert. In Warsaw, the recovered materials were placed in a warehouse at 6/8 Okrąg Street. The books were distributed both in the official circulation and supplied to underground bookstores. The publishing house also printed small quantities of missing parts of Ossendowski's books on salvaged paper.\nStefan Szpinger earned recognition and friendship from Wegner with his selfless transport action, who appointed him as the manager of the publishing house and granted him full authority to conduct all affairs. On 13 July 1941, Rudolf Wegner died of a heart attack. The publishing house was taken over by his wife, Wanda, and daughter, Irena Rybotycka, and was still managed by Stefan Szpinger, who, among other things, concluded negotiations with Maria Rodziewiczówna, obtaining exclusivity for Polish Publishing House to publish her works. The most valuable part of the preserved books was transferred to a new warehouse at New World Street. The publishing house's activities during the occupation were profitable due to the high demand for Polish books. Apart from patriotic motives, they were treated as a capital investment and fetched very high prices on the secondary market; for example, the price of Disslowa's cookbook reached up to 1,000 PLN per copy. Several tens of thousands of stockpiled volumes were excluded from sale, deemed by Szpinger and the company's owners as assets intended to restart the publishing house after the war.\nThe German authorities hindered Polish bookselling activities, further harassing Wegner's company with inspections in bookstores. They also established a company with the misleading name Polish Publishing House – Polnische Verlag, publishing, among other things, books of a pornographic nature, aiming to discredit the real Wegner publishing house. The Germans also enforced Szpinger's Poznań obligation to hand over the banned books of the publishing house to the authorities. However, only one incomplete \"platform\" of some titles by Bandrowski and Rodziewiczówna was likely handed over.\nDuring the Warsaw Uprising, books from the Wegner publishing house's warehouse on Okrąg Street were distributed to the insurgents for reading. Soon, the remaining books were used to build barricades, where they were destroyed. The warehouse on Okrąg Street was hit by a bomb and burned down; likewise, the second warehouse on New World Street burned down with all the books. As a result, the publishing house lost all its resources.\n\n\n=== Post-war period ===\n\n\n==== From 1945 to 1948: Germany ====\n\nIn November 1945, Irena Rybotycka left Poland for the American occupation zone in Germany, where she reunited with her husband, Colonel Tomasz Rybotycki, a liaison officer of the Polish Military Mission. Both of them then began efforts to resume the activities of Polish Publishing House R. Wegner to provide access to Polish books for Polish war refugees. Tomasz Rybotycki became the head of the Welfare and Printing Team established within the Polish Military Mission, and Irena Rybotycka, working with the Polish Red Cross, obtained an allocation of paper from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The Rybotyckis obtained permission to print books on religious and educational topics; the proposed set included 12 titles. They also managed to recover the old printing plates from Nuremberg, where Rudolf Wegner printed children's books. The resumed Polish Publishing House R. Wegner began its operations in Nuremberg in 1945, and books started to be published at the beginning of 1946. After a few months, the Rybotycki couple had to suddenly leave Germany due to the takeover of Polish facilities by the communist government. However, Tomasz Rybotycki managed to complete the printing of the planned titles, which were published until 1948.\n\n\n==== From 1947 to 1974: England ====\nAfter leaving Germany, the Rybotycki couple relocated to London. There, they received royalties for books published by Polish Publishing House R. Wegner during the war by the emigrant Ministry of Education. Together with Wanda Rybotycka, in 1947 they founded Tern (Rybitwa) Book Co. Ltd., primarily publishing old titles from Polish Publishing House R. Wegner, including selected books from the Library of Nobel Laureates and Wonders of Poland series. The reissue of Maria Disslowa's cookbook Jak gotować achieved the greatest success, also published in English as Continental European Cooking. New titles included Zofia Kossak-Szczucka's Heritage and Sir Philip Gibbs' political novel No Price For Freedom to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising. Rybitwa Publishing ceased its operations in 1974 after the death of T. Rybotycki.\n\n\n==== From 1947 to 1950: Poland ====\nSince 1947, Polish Publishing House R. Wegner resumed its operations in Poland. In the absence of the owners, the company was managed by a representative, Anna Łempicka. The headquarters were located in Warsaw at 10 Cecylia Śniegocka Street. They resumed the publication of several volumes from the Library of Nobel Laureates series, novels by Rodziewiczówna, as well as books for children and youth. The new editions were illustrated by Edward Kuczyński and Jan Marcin Szancer.\nIn 1950, the publishing house was liquidated by the decision of the Polish authorities at the time, and the publishing rights were taken over by the State Publishing Institute PIW.\n\n\n== Description of activity ==\nThe primary goal of Polish Publishing House was to offer high-quality books. They were carefully crafted during a long publishing cycle, sometimes lasting from 4 to 6 years, and in some cases even up to 10 years (such as Maria Disslowa's Jak gotować). The books were visually appealing, with numerous illustrations usually done using the copper-plate technique. They had artistic bindings and a consistent appearance within each publishing series or for a particular author. Leading Polish writers were employed for translations from foreign languages and for book editing. The high level of illustration and graphic design was ensured by artists such as Edward Kuczyński, Ernest Czerper, Rafał Malczewski, Kamil Mackiewicz, Tadeusz Lipski, Teodor Rożankowski, Leon Wyczółkowski, Jan Kilarski, and Jan Bułhak.\nPrinting was done on good quality paper, with later editions using special wood-free paper. Bibliophile albums were printed on handmade or Chinese paper. To enhance production, various font styles, typographic layouts, and formats were used, with colorful dust jackets. The quality of the books from Polish Publishing House is evidenced by letters received by Rudolf Wegner:\n\nThank you for the two beautiful copies of Dusza Zaczarowana, kindly sent to me. I would like us to have in France the Library of Nobel Laureates so artistically and diversely published.I have finally received a copy of the Polish edition of Julius Caesar [...]. Unable to judge the value of the translation, I admire the magnificence of the publication. In terms of printing, paper, and illustrations, it is the most splendid edition of my works. It has brought me much satisfaction, and I extend my congratulations to you.Speaking about this publication [Dzieje Papieży], I can only note that this edition makes an extraordinary impression. The paper, printing, binding are very good. Special commendation should be given to the illustrations, which are excellent in both selection and execution technique. I must confess frankly that this book in terms of illustration far surpassed the German edition.\nThe books were usually offered in two versions, paperback and \"bound\" (also known as \"luxury\"). Their prices were relatively high, up to 14 PLN for a hardcover book and 4–5 PLN cheaper for the paperback version. The cost of purchasing Wonders of Poland was even higher, reaching up to 20 PLN, which, however, considering the particularly attractive format and very high quality of the books, was often seen as a moderate price. Despite the high prices, the books sold quickly and were often reprinted. It was not until 1928 that high-volume printing of cheaper books (3 PLN per copy) intended for less demanding readers began.\nIn addition, Polish Publishing House offered luxury albums, priced at 100–200 PLN per copy. They were mostly purchased by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland for representational purposes, as well as by bibliophiles.\nThe publishing house did not have its own bookstore. The editions were distributed mainly through Gebethner i Wolff bookstores, as well as by the Książnica-Atlas company, and also through the Dom Książki Polskiej in Warsaw.\n\n\n== Printer's mark of the publishing house ==\nThe printer's mark of the publishing house underwent several changes. Initially, it had a circular shape, similar in style to the printer's mark of E. Wende (which was Wegner's first place of employment). From the mid-1920s, the marks took the form of intertwined letters P and W, positioned one above the other. In some books, the mark was not included (for example, in the Wonders of Poland series).\n\tExamples of printer's marks in books of the Polish Publishing House\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Kotwica symbol ===\n\nIn the early years of the German occupation, Jerzy Jabłonowski (former aide-de-camp to Marshal Józef Piłsudski) approached Irena Rybotycka with a request to use the publishing house's printer's mark displayed on the cover of the book Polowanie na potwory morskie (English: Hunting Sea Monsters) as a symbol of Poland's resistance against the occupant:\n\n[Jerzy Jabłonowski]: You know... Poland is fighting – that's clear, but we still need our own symbol, emblem, crest, or recognizable sign, like a signature or seal. These two initials PW artistically intertwined as our own sign. Your company, Polish Publishing House, has the same initials WP as our PW. Look at your mark on the cover: the initials stylized into the shape of an anchor (an anchor is a symbol of hope). I can't imagine a better combination of these two letters, as on the cover of your book. What would you say if we used it as the emblem of Fighting Poland? Even the title of the book fits. After all, we're only hunting monsters in the name of historical justice.\nDuring the war, part of the Polish population unequivocally associated the graphic design of the Kotwica symbol with the printer's mark of Polish Publishing House. The similarity – even the identity – of both symbols also caught the attention of the Gestapo, who conducted a raid on the publishing house and ordered the obfuscation of the printer's mark in all books intended for distribution.\n\n\n== Publisher's profile ==\n\nThe publishing house primarily focused on literature, both Polish and foreign. In its early years, it mainly published contemporary novels by Polish authors, including Jerzy Bandrowski, Marian Gawalewicz, Stefan Grabiński, Maria Rodziewiczówna, Wacław Sieroszewski, Jerzy Turnau, and Stanisław Wasylewski. Additionally, it released textbooks and books covering diverse topics such as veterinary science, agriculture, industry, and politics. Series with thematic focuses became a hallmark of the company's publishing plans. The first series, Gawędy o Dawnym Obyczaju. Wybór ciekawych pamiętników XVIII i XIX w. (English: Conversations on Old Customs: Selection of Interesting Memoirs from the 18th and 19th Centuries), began in 1920. The following year, Stanisław Lam initiated the editing of the extensive series Library of Nobel Laureates, which showcased the works of the most outstanding foreign writers from 1921 to 1939.\nChildren's literature was represented by series such as Książki Obrazkowe (English: Picture Books), Bajki i Baśnie (English: Fables and Fairy Tales), or the very popular Bajki Polskie Wujka Czesia (English: Polish Tales by Uncle Czesio) by Czesław Kędzierski. Numerous travel and adventure books were aimed at young adults, such as the series Świat Podróży i Przygód (English: World of Travel and Adventures).\nAmong the many books published outside of series, some notable titles include:\n\nMaria Disslowa's Jak gotować (English: How to Cook), Poznań, 1930, a comprehensive guide to cooking and entertaining.\nComplete works of:\n Maria Rodziewiczówna – 36 volumes (during World War II, the publishing house obtained exclusive rights to publish the author's works)\n Józef Weyssenhoff – only 3 volumes were released, numbers 1, 2, and 7.\nLuxurious bibliophile albums included:\n\nCamille Mauclair's Florence translated by L. Staff, Lviv – Poznań, 1926.\nJerzy Mycielski and S. Wasylewski's Polish Portraits of Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun 1755–1842, Lviv – Poznań, 1927. The book with 24 illustrations produced by the heliograph technique was issued in an edition of 1,100 numbered copies, in a format of 31×24 cm, on handmade paper. This paper was supplied to the publishing house and bore watermarks from the manufacturer – Mirkowski Paper Factory. Two other editions of the book were also released in different formats, one on Chinese paper, and the other described as a \"copy of the luxury edition\" (1928).\nJoseph Gregor and René Fülöp-Miller's American Theater and Cinema: Two Images from the History of Culture translated by S. Wasylewski, Poznań, 1931.\nFranciszek Ksawery Seppelt and Klemens Löffler's History of Popes, Poznań, 1936.\n\n\n=== Publishing series ===\n\n\n==== Conversations on Old Customs: Selection of Interesting Memoirs from the 18th and 19th Centuries ====\nThis was the first series of the Polish Publishing House, published in 1920–1930, and was compiled and edited by Stanisław Wasylewski.\n\n\n==== Library of Nobel Laureates ====\n\nPolish Publishing House made its mark with the groundbreaking series titled Library of Nobel Laureates, initiated in 1921 with the publication of Romain Rolland's novel Colas Breugnon. The idea for the series stemmed from Wegner's observation that most authors he intended to publish in Polish translations were Nobel laureates. From 1921 to 1926, the series was edited by Stanisław Lam, with later editorial oversight by Stanisław Wasylewski. Tadeusz Lipski and Jan Marcin Szancer were responsible for the graphic design, while illustrations were executed by Ernest Czerper and Teodor Rożankowski, and covers were designed by Edward Kuczyński. Translators included Józef Birkenmajer, Czesław Kędzierski, Leopold Staff, Jerzy Bandrowski, Florian Sobieniowski, Franciszek Mirandola, and Stanisław Wasylewski. This selection of translators and editors allowed for the publication of books that were not inferior in quality, appearance, or literary value to the originals. The thoughtful selection of authors and their works, along with the scale of the series, made it unique on a European scale. In Poland, which had only regained independence a few years earlier, the series was particularly valuable due to the very limited availability of foreign-language literature in Polish.\nThe series included works by the following Nobel laureates in literature:\n\nMaurice Maeterlinck – 11 titles, totaling 18 editions\nKnut Hamsun – 9 titles, totaling 15 editions\nRudyard Kipling – 8 titles, totaling 15 editions (Polish Publishing House had exclusive rights to publish Kipling in Poland)\nRabindranath Tagore – 8 titles, totaling 9 editions\nSelma Lagerlöf – 6 titles, totaling 9 editions\nKarl Gjellerup – 5 titles, totaling 8 editions\nPaul Heyse – 3 titles\nHenrik Pontoppidan – 3 titles, totaling 4 editions\nRomain Rolland – 3 titles, totaling 14 volumes and editions (Dusza zaczarowana was originally published in 3 volumes, later as one volume; Jan Krzysztof – 4 volumes)\nBjørnstjerne Bjørnson – 2 titles, totaling 3 editions\nCarl Spitteler – 2 titles, totaling 3 editions\nGrazia Deledda – 2 titles\nGerhart Hauptmann – 2 titles\nStanisław Reymont – 1 title, 4 editions\nJacinto Benavente – 1 title\nRudolf Eucken – 1 two-volume title\nAnatole France – 1 title\nVerner von Heidenstam – 1 title\nThomas Mann – 1 title\nGeorge Bernard Shaw – 1 title\nWilliam Butler Yeats – 1 title\nBy 1939, 80 volumes of the series had been published. All were numbered, had the same 8° format, graphic design, content layout on covers, and a unique graphic symbol. The entire edition was bound by the Przesławski i Cierniak Company, and in 1929, it was showcased at the Universal National Exhibition in Poznań.\nAfter the war, some books from the series were reissued in Warsaw (1947–1950) and London. In 1992, Irena Rybotycka offered to waive royalties if the series were resumed and continued in Poland, under the condition that books include a note about Rudolf Wegner and the origin of the series.\n\n\n==== Monographic studies ====\nKowalska, Marzena (2008). \"Literackie serie wydawnicze w latach 1921–1999\".

Retrieved 2016-02-24.\n\n\n==== World of Travel and Adventures ====\nThe highly popular series World of Travel and Adventures was published from 1925 onwards, with Czesław Kędzierski serving as its editor. True to its title, the series featured travel and adventure novels, most often with a maritime theme. Authors included Robert Louis Stevenson, Mark Twain, James Fenimore Cooper, Edgar Allan Poe, and Ferdynand Ossendowski.\n\n\n==== Epics and Legends ====\nA short series published between 1926 and 1927, comprising 3 titles concerning St. Francis of Assisi, Antarah ibn Shaddad, and Buddha.\n\n\n==== Library of Polish Authors ====\nThis series, started in 1928, was intended to present the works of young, contemporary Polish authors to readers. Among them were Jerzy Bandrowski, Jerzy Kossowski, Kornel Makuszyński, Stanisław Wasylewski, Ferdynand Ossendowski, Jan Wiktor, Maria Rodziewiczówna, and Julian Wołoszynowski. Within the series, books authored by Wacław Berent, Marian Gawalewicz, Ignacy \"Sewer\" Maciejowski, Adam Krechowiecki, and Aleksander Świętochowski were also reissued.\n\n\n==== Monographs of Great Figures and Historical Periods ====\nThis series, published between 1928 and 1935, comprised 10 volumes containing monographs of historical figures, well-known Polish and foreign authors, as well as historical novels and studies. These included works on:\n\nHistorical figures:\nEmil Ludwig, Napoleon (translated by L. Staff), Poznań, 1928\nKazimierz Waliszewski, Catherine II (translated by S. Wasylewski), Poznań, 1929\nFerdynand Ossendowski, Lenin, Poznań, 1930\nLouis Bertrand, Louis XIV (translated by S. Wasylewski), Poznań, 1931\nLiterary figures:\nTadeusz Pini, Krasiński. Life and Works, Poznań, 1928\nStanisław Adamczewski, Insatiable Heart. Book about Żeromski, Poznań, 1930.\nAndrzej Tretiak, Lord Byron, Poznań, 1930\nHistorical periods:\nJulian Wołoszynowski, The Year 1863, Poznań, 1931\nGuglielmo Ferrero, The Greatness and Fall of Rome; Vol. 1 Conquest, Vol. 2 Julius Caesar (translated by L. Staff), Poznań, 1935\n\n\n==== Wonders of Poland ====\n\nThe full name of the series was Miracles of Poland – Natural Monuments – Monuments of Labor – Historical Landmarks (Polish: Cuda Polski – Pomniki Przyrody – Pomniki Pracy – Zabytki Dziejów) and it had a geographical character. Alongside the Library of Nobel Laureates, it was the prestigious and most popular series of the publishing house. It was the result of Wegner's extensive analysis of the global publishing market. The French Collection les Beaux Pays published by J. Rey in Grenoble had the greatest influence on the final shape of the series.\nThe motto of the series was This is Poland – our homeland (Aleksander Fredro). Its goal was to promote patriotic values in Poland, so the publishing house was not focused on financial gain in this case, and the books were distributed largely outside the market. Government agencies used Wonders of Poland (like the publisher's bibliophilic items) to create a positive image of Poland abroad. It began in 1928, planned for 20 volumes, and 14 were published before the outbreak of the war. In 1939, volume 15 titled Volhynia was being prepared.\nThe Wonders of Poland were produced with particular care and attractiveness. All volumes had a consistent format (21×16 cm), graphic layout designed by Jan Bułhak, and a style of binding (designed by Ernest Czerper) and illustrations. They were printed in uniform font on the same special wood-free paper. Bułhak was also responsible for preparing the photographs – many of his own – illustrating the books. They were produced using the labor-intensive heliography technique. The maps were authored by Rudolf Wegner's son-in-law, Colonel Tomasz Rybotycki. Jan Kilarski, Kamil Mackiewicz, Rafał Malczewski, Teodor Rożankowski, and Leon Wyczółkowski's works were used for the covers. Each volume took about 4–6 years to prepare.\nThe production process was quite complex because printing was done by 4 different printing houses: Concordia in Poznań (text), Zakłady Graficzne Biblioteki Polskiej in Bydgoszcz (heliographic illustrations, rotogravure printing), and Saint Adalbert Printing House in Poznań and National Printing House in Kraków (covers).\nThe Wonders of Poland were highly popular, frequently reissued and reprinted, but the lack of volume numbering and publication dates complicates bibliographic analysis. The print runs of individual editions are also unknown. Selected volumes were reissued by units under the jurisdiction of the Polish government-in-exile (Lviv, Jerusalem 1944; Sea and Pomerania, Jerusalem 1946), and later by the Rybotycki couple, both in Nuremberg (fragments) and London (Polish Forests with an afterword Faithful Forest by Zofia Kossak about the Polish partisan movement 1940–1944, London 1953; Between the Niemen and the Dzvina with an afterword Faithful Land by Antoni Bogusławski, London 1955), as well as in Poland – through Anna Łempicka.\nThe series included 4 monographs of Polish cities and 10 monographs of regions:\n\nCities:\nAleksander Janowski: Warsaw (1930)\nStanisław Wasylewski: Lviv (1931)\nJerzy Remer: Vilnius (1934)\nJan Kilarski: Gdańsk (1938), also published in English\nRegions:\nJerzy Smoleński: Sea and Pomerania (1928), also published in English\nJerzy Smoleński: Greater Poland (1930)\nGustaw Morcinek: Silesia (1933), also published in English\nFerdynand Antoni Ossendowski: Polesie (1934)\nRafał Malczewski: Tatra Mountains and Podhale (1935)\nF. Antoni Ossendowski: Polish Forests (1936)\nF. Antoni Ossendowski: Hutsul Region, Gorgany, and Chornohora (1936)\nAleksander Patkowski: Sandomierz Region. Świętokrzyskie Mountains (1938)\nTadeusz Łopalewski: Between the Niemen and the Dzvina. Vilnius and Novogrudok Region (1938)\nF. Antoni Ossendowski: Carpathian Mountains and Subcarpathia (1939)\nUnpublished:\nKsawery Pruszyński: Volhynia\nStanisław Wasylewski: Polish Life in the 19th Century\nDuring the Polish People's Republic era, books in the series concerning the Eastern Borderlands were put on an index. War losses were compounded by library policies, which disposed of \"inconvenient\" titles. Some books were also stolen, and the surviving copies are often damaged. As a result, books in good condition became very valuable, with auction prices for some series reaching up to 500 PLN in the early 21st century. Many volumes of the series were reissued after 1989 by several publishing houses, but the quality of these books differs significantly from the original versions.\n\n\n==== Monographic studies ====\nRausz, Monika (2006). \"\"Cuda Polski\" Rudolfa Wegnera: historia edycji\". Annales Universitatis Paedagogicae Cracoviensis Studia ad Bibliothecarum Scientiam Pertinentia (in Polish). 4: 156–166.\nNowak, Adam (2008-12-12). \"\"Cuda Polski\", czyli Rudolf Wegner rediviva\". Wiadomości Księgarskie (in Polish). 57 (4): 80–85.\n\n\n==== Collected Works by Maria Rodziewiczówna ====\nThe Polish Publishing House released all the works of the highly popular Maria Rodziewiczówna. By 1939, 36 volumes had been published. During the occupation, the publishing house obtained exclusive rights to publish the author's works. The books were reissued by the emigrant government during the war, and later by the Rybotyckis – in Nuremberg, London, and Warsaw.\n\n\n==== Yellow Books ====\n\nThis series consisted of cheaper crime novels by contemporary Polish and foreign authors, inspired by the German Die Gelben Bücher (Ullstein Verlag). Despite their lighter, often criminal themes, they were positively reviewed. Between 1928 and 1934, over 40 volumes were published in print runs of up to 10,000 copies. Unlike the publications discussed above, the Yellow Books were only available in paperback.\n\n\n==== Film – Romance. Illustrated Novel Weekly ====\nA series of 20 weekly volumes edited by F. Antoni Ossendowski, published in 1938. These short, 16-page brochures, priced at 0.20 PLN, illustrated with stills from films, popularized film works, especially foreign ones.\n\n\n== Printing houses ==\nThe publishing house collaborated with the best Polish printing houses, allowing for the production of high-quality products. In Lviv, it utilized its own printing plant, the Polish Publishing House Press, since 1921. In Poznań, the main printing house for the publishing house became Concordia. Additionally, it collaborated with other printing establishments, including the Graphic Works of the Polish Library in Bydgoszcz, the Kraków-based National Printing House and Printing House of Ludwik Anczyc and Company, as well as several printing houses in Poznań: St. Adalbert Printing House, Printing House of \"Poradnik Gospodarczy\" of Jan Kuglin, Printing House of the Union of Youth, Polish Printing House, and Poznań Printing House and the National Plant T. A. Some illustrations were printed in Nuremberg. In post-war Poland, printing was mainly conducted at the Toruń Graphic Works. During the war, matrices of illustrations for children's books survived in Nuremberg, and possibly some matrices of the Wonders of Poland were taken from Poznań to Warsaw at the beginning of the occupation.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSzpinger, Stefan (1974).

        "content": "James White (1762 – December 17, 1825) was an English engineer and inventor. Born in Cirencester, he held an intense interest in mechanics at a young age. Moving to London in the 1780s, he created and patented various inventions, including a perpetual wedge machine and a model harbor crane. He moved to Paris in 1792, shortly following the French Revolution, and continued work in designing industrial machinery. Inventions from his period in Paris include an articulated barge, an early out-flow radial turbine, an automatic wire nail-making machine, and a hypocycloidal straight-line mechanism presented at the 1801 Exposition des produits de l'industrie française. He returned to England following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and settled in the industrial center of Manchester. He published A New Century of Inventions in 1822, detailing over a hundred of his mechanisms from across his career. In late 1825, he died at his home in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJames White was born in Cirencester, Gloucestershire in 1762. No baptismal record exists of his birth, possibly indicating that his parents were Nonconformists. His interests in mechanics begun at a young age; he claimed to have invented a mousetrap around age eight, and that he \"became a tolerable workman in all the mechanical branches long before the age at boys are apprenticed to any.\" Nothing is known of his education or whether he received an apprenticeship, although trade apprenticeships were limited in the mainly agrarian Cirencester.\nHis first major invention, a \"perpetual wedge machine\" (a concentric wheel and axle with 100 and 99 teeth respectively) was produced in 1786. In 1788, while living in Holborn, London, he filed a patent for multiple devices. This included multiple mechanical devices he did not invent, such as the Chinese windlass. He received a 40 guinea prize for submitting a model of a harbor crane design to the Society of Arts. In early 1792, he sent a letter from the Chevening estate in Kent, possibly indicating his acquaintanceship with the scientifically-minded 3rd Earl Stanhope, whom he would later name his \"noble Patron\".\n\nIn 1792, he moved to Paris, and resided along the Quai de Bethune on the Île Saint-Louis. It is unknown why White moved to France during the ongoing French Revolution. He patented a \"serpentine boat\" in 1795, articulating together a number of barges for transport in narrow or restrictive waterways, such as canals. He claimed to have invented a micrometer design later attributed to Gaspard de Prony, whom he showed the invention in 1796. He showcased a hypocycloidal straight-line mechanism at the 2nd Exposition des produits de l'industrie française in 1801, for which he received a medal from First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte. The following year, bolstered by cross-Channel transmission of information during the Peace of Amiens, Matthew Murray built a number of steam engines incorporating White's mechanism. \nIn 1806, he invented a \"horizontal waterwheel\", taking the form of an out-flow radial turbine, predating a similar turbine by Benoît Fourneyron in the late 1820s. It is unknown if the two are connected. In 1808, he patented single and double helical gears, oriented at a 15° angle, described by a later biographer as \"perhaps the invention on which he placed most store.\" During the early 1810s, he took out a number of additional industrial patents in France, but was prevented from filing patents in Britain due to the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars. These inventions include an automatic nail-making machine (the first known device to produce wire nails) and shears for cutting circular portions out of sheet iron. \nIn 1815, following the Hundred Days and the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, White returned to England. Upon his return, he moved to Manchester, then a major engineering and industrial center. In late 1815, he submitted a paper titled \"On a new system of cog or toothed wheels\" to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester. He published his main work, A New Century of Inventions, in 1822, detailing over a hundred of his machines and mechanisms from across his career. This work proliferated widely, reaching over 600 subscribers across the United Kingdom.  He died at his residence in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester on December 17, 1825.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "The Battle of Ocheretyne is an ongoing battle during the Russian Invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOcheretyne is a Ukrainian settlement in the Donetsk Oblast. On 9 December 2014, following the events surrounding the War in Donbass, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's national parliament, moved Yasynuvata Raion's administration buildings and government to вул. Першотравнева 12, (English: 12 May Day Street) in Ocheretyne, which is near the startigally important  H 20, about 35 km north-northwest of Donetsk, the capital of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. As a result, Ocheretyne was the de facto administrative center of the raion until it was abolished on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Donetsk Oblast to eight, of which only five were controlled by the government.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 16 April 2024, Russian forces advanced towards the settlement, and fighting over the settlement began. Per Forbes, Russian troops numbered at 10,000 including soldiers from the 15th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, 30th Motor Rifle Brigade, 74th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, elements of the 90th Guards Tank Division and special forces units. Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops numbered at only 3,000 including soldiers from the 23rd, 47th, 100th and 115th Mechanized Brigades, the 25th Airborne Brigade, the 3rd Assault Brigade and the 425th Assault Battalion. The 115th Mechanised Brigade arrived in Ocheretyne in April 2024. According to Mykola Melnyk, the famed 47th Mechanized Brigade company commander who lost a leg during the summer counteroffensive, the 115th Mechanised Brigade left their positions without permission, which led to a breakthrough by Russian forces within 48 hours. On 23rd April 2024, Ukrainian media reported that the army's leadership in Kyiv had launched an investigation to find out the reason for the 115th Mechanized Brigade's unauthorized leave. On 23 April, Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesperson for Ukraine's Khortytsia Group of Forces claimed that Russian forces were using chemical weapons. However, Voloshyn did not specify what type of chemical weapons were being used. On 23 April 2024, Russia claimed to have captured the settlement. However, on 26 April, Nazar Voloshyn claimed that Ukraine still controlled two-thirds of Ocheretyne. He also claimed that Russian forces brought in additional reserves from the 55th Mountain Motor Rifle Brigade to attempt and break through the Ukrainian defenses. On 27 April, a speaker of the Ukrainian defense forces stated that Ocheretyne was only partially captured by Russian troops and battles were ongoing. \n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe capture of at least parts of the village was attributed to a rotational error by Ukrainian military commanders that left the sector mostly undefended and led to Russian forces advancing five kilometers. Per DeepStateMap.Live, the capture of Ocheretyne was fastest penetration into Ukrainian territory by Russian forces in months. Some observers blamed the 115th Mechanized Brigade, which recently rotated into positions in Ocheretyne and was almost immediately overwhelmed by the Russian army's 30th Motor Rifle Brigade. On 24 April, DeepStateMap claimed in a Telegram post that: \"leaders of the 115th mechanized brigade, which is fighting in the area, were responsible for the collapse of the defense in the entire sector, allowing significant losses.\" Other observers blamed the stalled American aid, which had been delayed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Convict crisis, also known as the \"Anti-convict demonstrations\" or \"Anti-convict agitation\" or \"Cape Town anti-convict petition\" was a period of civil unrest and protesting, lasting from 4 July 1849 to February 1850, in the Cape Colony. It was caused by the prospect of the British authorities making the Cape Colony a penal colony and was triggered by the arrival off the coast of Cape Town of a ship, The Neptune, carrying 288 ticket-of-leave convicts from Ireland. The event was important in forming a distinct political identity in the Cape and strengthening the movement for self government.\n\n\n== Background ==\nStarting in 1841 the British government began suggesting that the Cape Colony be used as a penal colony in a policy similar to the policy of transporting convicts to Australia between 1788 and 1868. \nStronger proposals were again proposed on 7th August 1847 with the then Home Secretary, Sir George Grey, issuing a public dispatch to the Governor of the Cape Colony, Sir Harry Smith suggesting that the law on penal transport provisions be modified to include the Cape Colony as a destination for convicts; with the added suggestion that ticket-of-leave convicts might be a useful addition to the colony given its shortage of labour at the time. Sir Grey also requested that Governor Smith gauge local public opinion on the proposal. The proposal was made in the context of British efforts to alleviate the Great Famine of Ireland whilst also trying to subdue the Irish rebellion of 1848 and declining support for the practice in Australia. \nThe proposals caused widespread concern in the Cape Colony which at the time was regarded as relatively peaceful despite frequent conflicts with the amaXhosa on the colony's eastern frontier. It was made at a time when the responsible government movement was gaining momentum in the Cape. The presence of convicts was seen in the Cape as counterproductive to their efforts as advocating for responsible government for the colony in London. The hostile local reaction resulted in a number of petitions against the scheme being sent back to the Home Secretary in reply. \nHowever Grey did not wait for a response on the proposal before sending The Neptune to land convicts in the Cape and Bermuda.\n\n\n== Crisis ==\nIn March 1849 the Cape Town newspaper ‘Commercial Advertizer’ published news of The Neptune's expected arrival and purpose, which was confirmed by Governor Smith after he had received official dispatches about the new scheme. This news greatly angered the local population who felt that their strong opposition to the proposal had been ignored. It triggered a second, more intense, wave of protest actions, civil disobedience and promises of boycotts. Multiple councilors and notable business people who were involved in discussions to supply the ship were attacked and had their property looted and destroyed by angry mobs.\nOn 4 July 1849 a large multi-racial, multi-ethnic crowd to gather outside the Commercial Exchange. It was estimated that the crowd numbered over 5,000 Capetonians, perhaps as much as a quarter of the city's roughly 20,000 strong population at the time. Petitions were signed against the proposal and sent to Queen Victoria, a pledge was signed not to receive or employ any convicts, and an Anti-Convict Committee was formed. John Fairbairn was elected as the Anti-Convict Committee's secretary, he was later assaulted in his Green Point home, allegedly by government agents. \nWhen the ship arrived off the coast of Cape Town on 19 September 1849 local officials refused to allow anyone to disembark from the vessel or for the vessel to receive any supplies, local government institutions were also ordered not to sell any provisions to the ship or convicts onboard. Among the prisoners onboard was the Irish nationalist and revolutionary John Mitchel.\nAfter being refused disembarkment and supply by the people of Cape Town, The Neptune sailed to nearby Simon’s Bay. The situation became desperate when Governor Smith ordered a local businessman and British army captain, Robert Stanford, to provide provisions to the ship causing a standoff. Although Stanford complied with the order it damaged the legitimacy of the local government whilst Captain Stanford was banned and boycotted by the general public. When Stanford's daughter fell ill no doctors would see her; upon her death from the illness Stanford left the Cape for Britain. \nIn February 1850, after a 5 month long standoff, The Neptune sailed on to Van Diemen’s Land in Australia. This period severely tested the Cape Peninsula Urban Police as they had to deal with many incidents of public violence and unrest.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe issue was finally resolved when British MP Charles Adderley removed the possibility of the Cape becoming a penal colony in the British parliament. In recognition the street in front of the Commercial Exchange where the 4 July 1849 demonstration took place, Heerengracht Street, was renamed Adderley Street. \nThe protests resulted in a decline in the popularity of the pro-British local publication, the African Journal The political unity the crisis produced resulted in it becoming an important event in the development of the Cape's growing independence from Great Britain. Fueling the movement for responsible government that would result the establishment of the Cape Parliament in 1853 and in self government in 1872.\n\n\n== References ==",

In March 1990 the team played against today's Dresdner Eislöwen and lost 2:6. The before the reunification of the two German states) was the first German-German comparison in 36 years.\nThe TSG team achieved its greatest success in 2006 with the championship of the RL-Hesse.

        "content": "Newmarket Town Hall is a former municipal building in Newmarket, Suffolk, a town in England.\nThe building was constructed in about 1830, as the Fisher Theatre.  In 1849, it was converted into a town hall.  The building included a public hall, which was used for a variety of events.  In 1907, it was being used as a cinema, when the projector was knocked over, causing a fire.  In the resulting panic, there were about 300 injuries, some serious.\nIn the 1920s, the building was converted into the offices of the Newmarket Gas Company, with a showroom on the ground floor.  This was replaced by the Jane of Newmarket women's fashion shop in 1978, and then Anne Furbank in 2008.  In 2012, it became a branch of the Wildwood Italian restaurant chain.\nThe two-storey building is at 29 High Street.  It has a canted facade, with one round-headed first-floor window on each of the three faces.  The ground floor has a mid-20th century shopfront.  The former public hall is on the first floor, and has a moulded ceiling.  The building has been grade II listed since 1984.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wick Lifeboat Station is located at the harbour town and royal burgh of Wick, Highland, in the NE corner of Scotland, in the historic county of Caithness.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the British Fisheries Society in 1848. It was taken over by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1895.\nSince 1997, the station has operated a Trent-class All-weather lifeboat, 14-20\tRoy Barker II (ON 1224).\n\n\n== History ==\nDisaster struck Wick and Caithness on what is still called \"Black Saturday\", the 19 August 1848. Fishing boats, which had started out in calm weather on Fri 18 August, found themselves in huge seas and a full gale on the Saturday. Ultimately, 18 vessels were wrecked, and 37 Wick fisherman lost their lives.\nA lifeboat was then ordered to be placed at Wick by the British Fisheries Society (BFS), and handed to the care of the Wick and Pulteneytown Harbour Trust. She was a 28-foot 12-oar boat, thought to be built to the design of Henry Greathead, but actually built by Edward Oliver, of South Shields. Costing £169, she arrived in Wick on a steamer, on 11 November 1848.\nA replacement boat would be supplied again by the BFS in 1857, and then, 12 years later, when the second boat was found to be completely useless due to dry rot, another was provided in 1870. In 1872, the BFS also funded the construction of a boathouse. In 1894, after 24 years further service, the Wick and Pulteneytown Harbour Trust realised that their boat needed replacing, but the benefactor of their boats had disappeared, the BFS having been wound up in 1893. In 1894, it was agreed that the station would be taken over by the RNLI. Hector Sutherland, Town Clerk at Wick, and Honorary Secretary of Ackergill lifeboat station, was also appointed Honorary Secretary for Wick lifeboat station, both stations being run by the same branch committee.\nThe RNLI immediately ordered a new boat, a 34-foot 10-oar Self-righting \"Pulling and Sailing\" (P&S) lifeboat (using oars and sails), constructed by Woolfe, costing £345, which arrived in Wick on 3 December 1895. On 10 December 1895, the boat was named John Avins at a ceremony at the Rifle Drill Hall, Pulteneytown, the boat funded by the legacy of Mr J. Avins of Birmingham.\nIn a storm of April 1905, the boat was launched to the aid of four fishing boats in difficulties in Wick Bay. Having just cleared the harbour entrance, the John Avins was hit with a succession of large waves, and smashed against the North Quay wall. Four crew that were washed overboard were recovered to the lifeboat, but the boat was then swept up the Quay and dashed on the rocks. Fortunately all crew were brought ashore, but the boat was badly damaged and subsequently withdrawn from service. A relief lifeboat, the Oldham (ON 335), was placed at Wick, remaining there for the next 8 years, but was never launched on service.\n\nIn 1913, the RNLI decided to close the station temporarily, whilst a new boathouse and roller-slipway was constructed at Salmon Rock to house a new motor lifeboat. Costing £4000, the boathouse was completed in 1916, but owing to the First World War, it would be 1921 before the lifeboat was ready, and Wick would received their first motor-powered lifeboat, the 45ft Watson-class Frederick and Emma (ON 659).\nIn 1994, the Tyne-class lifeboat 47-016 Norman Salveson (ON 1121) was placed on a mooring in the Inner harbour. With the lifeboat now moored afloat, a new station building was required near to the lifeboat, providing up to date crew facilities. Work was started in January 1997 and completed in the August of the same year. On 13 February 1997, Fraserburgh received their current lifeboat, the 14-20 Roy Barker II (ON 1224). Mr Frederick Roy Barker (1909–1992), known as Roy, left his entire estate to the RNLI, known as the Roy Barker Memorial Fund, with the request that all income be used to fund lifeboats. Wick received one of three Trent-class lifeboats from the fund. A pontoon berth was constructed in 2007 at a cost of £270,000.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Wick\n\nRNLI Silver Medal\nAndrew Lake, Chief Officer, H.M.

        "content": "Daryl Hallett Nims (July 18, 1923 – January 7, 1996) was an American politician.\nDaryl Nims was born to parents Harold Nims and Aline Schaal on July 18, 1923, in Des Moines, Iowa. After graduating from Theodore Roosevelt High School in 1941, Nims served in World War II as a lieutenant of the United States Army Air Forces, and earned a bachelor's degree in marketing from Drake University in 1947. Nims played basketball throughout high school for the Roosevelt Roughriders, and, during his senior season was named to the Des Moines Tribune All-City team. Nims continued his collegiate basketball career with the Drake Bulldogs until 1946.\nIn 1951, Nims acquired the Ames branch of Mickelson's Company, a sporting goods manufacturer and retailer, which he renamed Sportsman's of Ames, and operated for 35 years. At the time, Nims had worked in the industry for five years, including one year as a sales representative for previous owner B. O. Mickelson. After retiring, Nims returned to Des Moines.\nNims was elected to the Iowa Senate in 1964, as a Democratic legislator for District 26. He ran for reelection in 1966, losing to Pearle DeHart. From 1989 to 1991, Nims was a doorman for the Iowa State Capitol. In 1992, Nims was one of seven candidates who contested the Democratic nomination for District 68 of the Iowa House of Representatives. After losing to Michael Cataldo, Nims ran in the general election as an independent candidate, again losing to Cataldo. Nims faced Cataldo in the 1994 Democratic Party primary as well, losing for a third time. \nNims died at Mercy Hospital Medical Center in Des Moines on January 7, 1996.\n\n\n== References ==",

It follows three teenage girls whose slumber party is infiltrated by a psychopath who recently escaped from a local hospital. The film was featured on RiffTrax in 2014.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe Last Slumber Party was release directly-to-video in 1988 by United Home Video. VCI Entertainment released the film on DVD in 2004 as part of a double feature with Terror at Tenkiller (1986). In 2024, the American Genre Film Archive (AFGA) released the film for the first time on Blu-ray.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nIn his book The Gorehound's Guide to Splatter Films of the 1980s (2015), writer Scott Aaron Stine compared the film negatively to The Slumber Party Massacre (1982), deeming it an ineffective \"rehash\". In 2015, journalist Erik Piepenburg of The New York Times noted similarities between both films as well, but profiled the film in an article on underrated \"final girls\" in slasher films.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Last Slumber Party at IMDb",

        "content": "Dana C. Giacchetto (October 15, 1962 – June 12, 2016) was an American stockbroker and financial criminal. Nicknamed the \"Stockbroker to the Stars\", he was the money manager for various celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and was known for his lavish parties in his loft in SoHo, which DiCaprio and other celebrities stayed in.\nHe was arrested in 2000 for defrauding his clients of $9.8 million and was sentenced to 57 months in prison, later being charged for fraud again in 2014. Giacchetto served a 57-month prison sentence, being released early in 2003. Following his 2014 arrest, he was placed on two years' probation. He died at his apartment in 2016 following an overdose a week prior.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\n\nGiacchetto was born on October 15, 1962, in Medford, Massachusetts to Cosmo J. and Alma Rapallo Giacchetto. Giacchetto completed his high school education at Medford High School in 1980. He then attended the University of Massachusetts Boston, where he studied English and economics, graduating in 1990. While in college, he was part the new wave band Breakfast in Bed and aspired to be a rock keyboard player and vocalist. In 1995, he moved to New York.\nIn 1987, he started the Cassandra Group using a $200,000 loan from his mother and being headquartered in the 561 Broadway Singer Building. The company's core mission revolved around investing in blue-chip stocks and corporate bonds, with a conservative approach that prioritized low-risk securities. He was able to meet talent agent Jay Moloney, and through him, was introduced to people such as Michael Ovitz and Leonardo DiCaprio. At the company's peak, it had $400 million in assets with clients such as Tim Roth, Cameron Diaz, and Tobey Maguire. During this time, he was friends with people like Ovitz, Alanis Morissette, and Michael Stipe, with some inviting him to vacations. By 1999 however, Giacchetto's agents began withdrawing their funds from his management due to his lifestyle.\n\n\n== Legal issues ==\nIn April 2000, Giacchetto was arrested and charged of fraud and lying to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging that he misappropriated funds belonging to his clients, which he managed through the Cassandra Group. Giacchetto's parents mortgaged their home to secure his bail. Weeks after he was released, he was arrested again after getting off a flight from Las Vegas to Newark, New Jersey with a doctored passport, $4,000 in cash, and dozens of first-class tickets on hand. In August 2000, Giacchetto pleaded guilty to the charges, admitting to embezzling an estimated $5 million to $10 million from the accounts under his management. He received the maximum sentence of 57 months in prison for his crimes. Giacchetto was released early from prison in February 2003 and permitted to work in a regular job. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission permanently banned him from working in the investment business.\nIn February 2014, Giacchetto was charged with wire and access device fraud, with the complaint alleging that he made multiple purchases with another person's credit card. American Express had notified the cardholder of a fraudulent charge, where it was later discovered the Giacchetto had made multiple purchases using their card. He surrendered on February 20 and faced 25 years in prison. Giacchetto received a sentence of two years' probation, which included four months of home confinement.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nGiacchetto's girlfriend was Allegra Brosco, whom he had met years earlier and hired for a job. They became engaged while Giacchetto was imprisoned, deciding to hold off a wedding at the advice of their parents. Giacchetto's younger brother, Russell Giacchetto, was arrested in 2015 for assault and battery and was a suspect in a 2018 stabbing in East Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nPrior to his first arrest, he lived in a loft in SoHo, Manhattan above the offices of the Cassandra Group in the Singer Building. Many celebrities stayed in the lofts, including Leonardo DiCaprio, who from 1998 to 1999 stayed in his loft for months at a time. He owned a cockatoo named Angel, which resided in the loft alongside DiCaprio's cockatoo named Tiberius. His loft in SoHo was vacated in after his indictment, with his possessions being stored and sold to others. Afterwards, he lived in an apartment in the Upper East Side with a roommate.\nOn June 12, 2016, Giacchetto died in his apartment following a weekend partying, which included attending a premiere party for the movie Legends of Freestyle. Brosco became worried about Giacchetto after being unable to reach him, prompting her to contact his friends. The following day, Giacchetto's roommate discovered his body in bed, facing upwards, with foam at the mouth. Just a week before his passing, paramedics revived Giacchetto from an overdose after administering an adrenaline shot. Following his death, Giacchetto's body was taken to a morgue at Hart Island, where it remained unclaimed. His mother was unable to get $7,000 to claim it, making it difficult for her to arrange a proper burial for him.\n\n\n== References ==",

The waters of La Cañada flow into the right bank of the Suquía River.\nIn local culture, La Cañada refers to the channeling (currently about 3 km in length) and not to the stream itself, which is longer (about 28 km in length). This work represents one of the icons of the city, with designs in stone, several bridges and trees of tipa.\nThe channeling was opened in 1944 in an attempt to control the floods that affected several sectors of the city.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA guided visit of La Cañada (in Spanish)",

The final will be the culmination of the 2023–24 Svenska Cupen, the 68th season of Svenska Cupen and the twelfth season with the current format.\n\n\n== Venue ==\nSince the 2014–15 season, the venue for the Svenska Cupen final is decided in a draw between the two finalists. The draw for the final was held on 24 March 2024 and decided that the final would be played at Eleda Stadion, Malmö, the home ground of Malmö FF. This will be the second cup final to be hosted at the venue, the previous one having been in 2016.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe winner will qualify for the Europa League first qualifying round. However, since Malmö FF won the 2023 Allsvenskan, they are already qualified for the Champions League second qualifying round. If Malmö FF win the final, the Europa League spot will be passed to the second-placed team in 2023 Allsvenskan, IF Elfsborg, and the second Conference League second qualifying round spot will be passed to the fourth-placed team, Djurgårdens IF.\nMalmö will play their first final since 2022 and their 22nd in total. Djurgården will play their first final since 2018 and their tenth in total. Both clubs won in their previous final appearances. Having met in 1951, 1975, 1989, and 2018, this will be the fifth final to contest the two clubs. Malmö have won four of the prior meetings in the final of the competition while Djurgården have won one. The clubs faced each other once in Allsvenskan prior to the cup final, at Tele2 Arena on 25 April where Malmö won 1–0.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n== Route to the final ==\n\nNote: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\n\n\n== Match ==\n\n\n=== Details ===\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ersilia Fossati (25 March 1921 - 9 October 1999) was a Swiss politician from the canton of Ticino. She was a member of the Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland and a campaigner for women's suffrage. When Switzerland eventually granted women the federal vote on 7 February 1971, Fossati was one of the first eleven women elected to the Grand Council of Ticino in 1971.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nErsilia Fossati was born on 25 March 1921 in Veneto near Piave, in Italy, where her father ran a cooperative. She was the eldest of eleven children born to Rosa (née Scala) and Andrea Fossati, an engineer from Carona. Her father's family came from Meride, in the canton of Ticino, in Switzerland.\nDuring her childhood, she was in regular contact with her Swiss relatives in Ticino and spent her summer holidays at her paternal family's house. In 1939, the imminence of the Second World War led to her family moving back from Italy to live in Meride in Switzerland.\nErsilia Fossati attended primary and secondary school at the Ghislanzoni Institute in Milan, in Italy run by the Ursulines of Saint Charles. \nShe continued her studies at the teacher training college, the Magistrale di Locarno, where she earned a teaching certificate in 1941.\n\n\n== Second World War ==\nFrom 1941 to 1942, Fossati taught Italian at the Institute of the Sisters of Ingenbohl, during which time she also learned German. \nIn 1940, Fossati volunteered for the Frauenhilfsdienst (FHD), the Swiss Women's Army Auxiliary Service, in response to a national call from General Henri Guisan. Although Switzerland remained neutral throughout the Second World War, the country was prepared to defend itself from a potential Nazi invasion through National Redoubt plans. The Swiss army was mobilised in September 1939, and women’s organisations stepped up in support and the FHD was founded. The Frauenhilfsdienst was officially recognised in April 1940, and its female volunteers worked for the army in communications, logistics, and as medical orderlies. Until the end of the Second World War, Fossati carried out administrative and assistance tasks as part of the FHD, first in Berne and then in Cugnasco for which she was later awarded an honour for her service during the war. She continued her membership of the FHD until 1978, from 1951 to 1964, whilst president of the Ticino section of the FHD, she ran refresher courses in both German and Italian. \nFrom 1941 to 1942, Fossati taught Italian at the Institute of the Sisters of Ingenbohl, during which time she also learned German.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFossati had a varied work career before becoming an elected politician. Between 1942 and 1971, she worked on cataloguing dialect terms as part of the team run by Silvio Sganzini, a Swiss linguist, teacher and lexicographer, who was director of the Vocabolario dei dialetti della Svizzera italiana, an ongoing project recording and publishing the vocabulary of the dialects of Italian Switzerland. \nFrom 1963, she was in charge of the adult education college in Lugano.\nFrom 1971 to 1975, Fossati worked as a secretary at Fidinam, a private consultancy company. After this, she worked for the homecare service in Lugano and the surrounding area until 1983. During this time, she succeeded in tripling the number of partner municipalities.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nErsilia Fossati became involved in politics in 1962, when she joined the Ticino Association for Women's Suffrage. At this point, women in Switzerland did not have the vote, despite demands being made since the later nineteenth century. In February 1959, a referendum of all male voters had voted 66.9% to 33% against granting female suffrage in all but three cantons. Fossati became involved in campaigning for women's suffrage in Switzerland, speaking at conferences organised in various communes prior to the successful 1969 cantonal and 1971 federal votes which eventually granted women's suffrage.\nIn 1964, Fossati founded the Lugano branch of the Zonta International club. She was president from 1964 to 1966, and again from 1970 to 1971. From 1987 to 1990, she was a member and then cantonal president of the Catholic association Pro Filia, supporting young people in educational and people of all ages in need of help.\nShe is also a member of the foundation board of the Pro Senectute (de) section, which includes the canton of Ticino and the district of Moesa.\nFossati was a member of the Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland (PDC), she was one of the first eleven women elected to the Grand Council of Ticino in 1971, when Switzerland eventually granted women the vote. She served until 1983. During the 1970s, she also chaired the Lugano PDC women's group and became the first treasurer of the cantonal PDC women's association, founded in 1985.\nAs a legislator and member of parliament, she campaigned for the establishment of a teacher training college for kindergarten teachers in Lugano and Locarno, fought against the abolition of maintenance payments in the event of the insolvency of a former spouse, and opposed the mining works of Saceba SA in Balerna on environmental grounds.\n\n\n== Death and commemoration ==\nErsilia Fossati died in Lugano on 9 October 1999.\nIn 2021, the commune de Mendrisio named a road in the Meride area in Fossati's honour.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nFossati, S Ersilia (1981). \"1941-1981 quarantesimo di fondazione del Servizio Complementare\" (pdf).

Prior to his baptism, he was an innkeeper. \nA Catholic layman named Xu, who had been sent to Guizhou by Fr. Luo Madi of Sichuan, stayed at Wu Guosheng's inn. On this occasion, Xu spoke to Wu Guosheng about Christianity and convinced Wu Guosheng to believe. Xu later invited a church elder from Sichuan to speak to Wu Guosheng.\nWu Guosheng became very fervent for the faith and although he was not yet baptized, he would insist that those who visited his inn come to accept Jesus. Fr. Luo Madi later also went to visit Wu Guosheng and felt that Wu Guosheng's way of trying to force people to accept the faith was wrong. He then invited Wu Guosheng to come to Sichuan and see how other Catholics carried out evangelization. In 1795 he came to Chongqing and after having seen the model of other Catholics, Wu Guosheng deeply regretted his prior behaviour. Luo Madi then baptized him the following year with the name Christian name of Peter.\nHe returned back to Longping and engaged in a great deal of evangelization among the local people. The Catholic community grew to several hundred people. \nIn 1814, a new wave of persecution against Christians occurred in China as a result of the policies of the Jiaqing Emperor. On April 3rd of that year, he was arrested and put in prison. He encouraged the other prisoners and refused the orders of the magistrate to trample on the cross. He was strangled by hanging on November 7th of that year. \n\n\n== Canonization ==\nHe was beatified by Pope Leo XIII on May 27th 1900 and later canonized as a saint by John Paul II on October 1st 2000. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Simon Maljevac (born 26 February 1981) is a Slovenian LGBT rights activist, politician and current Minister of Solidarity-Based Future of Slovenia. He was the general-secretary of the The Left from 2018 to 2022\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMaljevac was born 26 February 1981 in Postojna. He has a degree in sociology from the University of Ljubljana (2012). Maljevac is homosexual.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMaljevac worked for communications engineering agency Directa and Legebitra, a LGBT NGO. During his tenure as head of Legebitra from 2007 to 2017 the organisation became the largest LGBT group in Slovenia. He was the Slovenian representative in the EU Network group of ILGA-Europe in 2006 and president of IGLYO from 2007 to 2009. He and Nika Kovač founded the Inštitut 8. marec in 2016. He was head of the monitoring, awareness-raising and prevention department at the Advocate of the Principle of Equality (Zagovornik načela enakosti) from 2017 to 2018. He has also worked with the Ministry of Health, The Peace Institute, and the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities on several projects. Maljevac was also editor-in-chief of the Narobe magazine. He has also been an academic and co-authored several scientific papers.\nMaljevac was one of the leading members of the \"Čas je ZA\" group which campaigned for a yes vote during the unsuccessful 2015 Slovenian same-sex marriage referendum. After the referendum he joined The Left as he claimed that it was the only party that fully supported amending the Family Code. He was the general-secretary of The Left from 2018 to 2022. At the 2018 Slovenian parliamentary election Maljevac was a The Left candidate in Kranj but was not elected. At the 2022 Slovenian parliamentary election he was a The Left candidate in Celje but was again not elected.\nFollowing the 2022 Slovenian parliamentary election The Left became a junior partner in the government of Prime Minister Robert Golob. Maljevac was a candidate to be Minister of Labor, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities but the post was instead given to Luka Mesec. It had been intended that Mesec would head the newly created Ministry for a Solidary Future but this was abandoned after the far-right Slovenian Democratic Party threatened to submit the creation of the new ministry to a national referendum. Maljevac was instead appointed State Secretary with responsibility for equal opportunities, family, disabled persons, older people and deinstitutionalisation at the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. In January 2023 he was promoted to Minister of Solidarity-Based Future of Slovenia.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMaljevac lives with his partner, academic Roman Kuhar, in Šenčur.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== Works ==\n——; Kuhar, Roman; Šalamon, Neža Kogovšek & Humer, Živa (2011).

        "content": "Monsalvat School of Comparative Religion (sometimes spelled, Montsalvat) was established in 1896 in Eliot, Maine, U.S. as a constituent school of Sarah Jane Farmer's Greenacre Conferences. It was sustained by voluntary contributions.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nThe Free Religious Association of America was founded as a non-sectarian organization devoted to the scientific study of religions. Its work, however, was limited, and the first great popular movement in the direction aimed at by its founders was seen in the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago, in connection with the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. None of the leaders in this work ever lost their interest in it, or their conviction of its far-reaching importance.\n\nAs a result of her observation of the inspiring effects of the Parliament of Religions at Chicago, and of her own experience with the Oriental teachers, the same thought came to Sarah J. Farmer, the founder of the Greenacre lectures. In 1895, she offered to Lewis G. Janes the opportunity to establish a school for the comparative study of religions at Greenacre. He was for many years president of the Brooklyn Ethical Association.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nThe first session of the Monsalvat (\"Mount of Peace\") School of Comparative Religion was held in the summer of 1896, and a month was devoted to this work in each successive season, with steadily increasing interest and attendance. In 1898, the number of students registered was 122. Able representatives of the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Parsee, Jewish, and Mohammedan faiths participated from year to year in the work of the Monsalvat School, and scholarly lectures were delivered on various phases of Christian doctrine.\nThe aim of the work was constructive, rather than merely critical; but opportunity for conference and friendly criticism was offered after each lecture. No propaganda of any particular doctrine was permitted, but each student was expected to exercise his judgment freely on all the topics treated, and to form their own unbiased conclusions. Among the students each year were a number of clergymen of different denominations, and it was especially desired to extend the work in this direction, and to offer its opportunities to divinity students and others who were preparing for ethical or religious teaching. The courses were invaluable to those who aimed to become missionaries, whatever their religious convictions, for no missionary worker could be fully qualified for their duties without a sympathetic knowledge of other faiths.\n\nThe Monsalvat School stood for the conviction of its founder and promoters that the search for ideal truth was more vital and helpful to life than the propaganda of any special doctrine. The motto of this sentiment, from Herbert Spencer's \"First Principles,\" was printed in the prospectus of the Monsalvat School:— \"In proportion as we love truth more and victory less, we shall become anxious to know what it is that leads our opponents to think as they do. We shall begin to suspect that the pertinacity of belief exhibited by them must result from a perception of something which we have not perceived. And we shall aim to supplement the portion of truth we have found zwith the portion found by them.”\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nAmong the speakers who constituted the faculty of the School from year to year, besides the director, were:\n\nProfessor Nathaniel Schmidt, chair of Semitic Languages and Literature in Cornell University\nProfessor Ismar J. Peritz, of Syracuse University\nthe Swami Saradananda and the Swami Abhedananda, of India, representing the Vedanta philosophy and Hindu religion\nthe Anagarika Dharmapala, of Ceylon (Parsis)\nJehanghier Dossabhoy Cola, of Bombay, India, representing the Zoroastrian (or Parsee) faith\nRev. F. Huberty James, of England, for 16 years a missionary in China and scholar in the Chinese literature\nVirchand Gandhi, B.A., M.R.A.S., of Bombay, India, the representative of the Jain communities in the Parliament of Religions\nJean du Buy, Ph.D., of Berlin, Germany, whose course on the ethical and spiritual teachings of the New Testament was subsequently published\nRuth Gibson, of Medford, Massachusetts, who expounded the philosophy of Emanuel Swedenborg\nRabbi Joseph Silverman, of Temple Emanu-El, New York City, who lectured on the Talmud\nEmin Leo Nabokoff, a representative of Mohammedan faith\nT. B. Pandian, of Madras, India, who spoke on social conditions and missionary work in that country\nShehadi Abd-Allah Shehadi, of Syria, whose topic was the religious and social customs of the Syrians and Bedouin Arabs\nCharles Malloy, President of the Emerson Society of Boston, who spoke on Emerson's indebtedness to Oriental thought\n\n\n== References ==",

Mowry was an American politician.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nA native of Baxter, Iowa, John Mowry was born on December 15, 1905 to parents William Mowry and Grace Lindsay Conn. Mowry graduated from Marshalltown High School in 1924, then enrolled at Ohio State University before transferring to the University of Iowa. After completing his bachelor's degree in 1928, Mowry earned a Juris Doctor at Iowa's College of Law in 1930. \n\n\n== Federal Bureau of Investigation and military career ==\nMowry was a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1930 to 1934, assigned to investigate racketeering. Following Thomas E. Dewey's appointment as special prosecutor in 1935, Mowry became special agent responsible for Manhattan, serving through 1938. Between 1941 and 1944, Mowry served stateside in the United States Army Air Forces, and was stationed in Philadelphia. The following year, he served a term as national president of the Society of Former Agents of the FBI.\n\n\n== Political career in Iowa ==\nMowry began a four-year term as Marshall County attorney in 1938, and was mayor of Marshalltown from 1950 to 1955. Between 1957 and 1965, Mowry was a Republican legislator for District 51 of the Iowa House of Representatives. In 1963 and 1964, he was house majority leader. Mowry returned to the state house, again for District 51, from 1967 to 1969. He was subsequently elected to Iowa Senate from 1969 to 1973, serving two years in each in District 26 and District 18 due to redistricting.\nIn 1961, Mowry opposed a bill allowing for Iowa Supreme Court and district court judges to be gubernatorial appointments, rather than popularly elected. \n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nMowry's uncle Ross also served in the Iowa Legislature. John Mowry married Irene Lounsberry, a daughter of fellow lawyer Harold C. Lounsberry, on June 7, 1941. The couple had one daughter, Madelyn. He died at the Marshalltown Medical and Surgical Center on November 1, 1995, aged 89.\n\n\n== References ==",

The secretary of state, Francisco de Anaya Almazán, took their sworn statements. The natives testified that Hidalgo used castration and sodomy as punishments, including twisting the penis of a native man, Pedro Acomilla, until it broke. They also described Hidalgo murdering two native men in order to gain sexual access to their wives; taking a native baby from its mother and throwing it into a fireplace; and raping and impregnating a number of native women.\nAlthough de Rosas wrote to the Inquisition, which preserved a record of the statement, no official action was taken. In 1639, Hidalgo was reassigned to Sandia Pueblo. Historians including Zeb Tortorici and Jerry Craddock speculate that Hidalgo's behavior may have contributed to the 1639 revolt of Taos Pueblo.\n\n\n== References ==",

The complex now serves as a seminary. \n\n\n== Description ==\nA pieve or rural parish church called Sant'Andrea in Postierla is documented since 1170. In 1339, commissioned by the Bishop Ranuccio Allegretti, an Olivetan monastery was built atop the old etruscan walls on this site. They remained in the monastery till it was closed in 1783, by order of the Grand-Duke Leopold, and transferred to become the Seminario Vescovile. The seminary, founded in 1704, had previously been located in the Palazzo Incontri on the Piazza Maggiore.\nA small church is attached to convent, but many of the artworks have been moved including to the Diocesan museum of Volterra, now in the church of Sant'Agostino. In 1767, Bishop Jacopo Gaetano Inghirami consecrated the church. In a survey from 1832, the church had two canvases (1698) flanking the entrance depicting Miracles of the blessed Bernardo Tolomei, founder of the Olivetan order, painted by Giovanni Battista Maioli. A side altarpiece depicting Santa Francesca Romana was painted  Vanni senior. The side altarpiece depicting the Presentation at the temple was painted by Arrighi and Baldassarre Franceschini. There was a canvas altarpiece depicting the blessed Bernardo Tolomei  by Giovanni Morari. Flanking the main altar were canvases depicting the Martyrdom of St Andrew Apostle and St Peter crossing the Sea by Giuseppe Arrighi. The chapel dedicated to the Holy Heart of Jesus had a alabaster ciborium (1574).\n\n\n== References ==",

In addition to Orford, its attendance zone includes the following places in Vermont: Fairlee, Vershire, and West Fairlee.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis district is a consolidation of four existing school districts. The residents of the area approved establishing this district in an election held on October 13, 1998. Rivendell Supervisory Union began administrative oversight of those four districts effective July 1, 1999, and the district itself began operations on the same calendar date in 2000. It was the first school district in the United States to officially include territory in multiple states. In 1999 there was a bond proposal to build new secondary and primary schools.\nKeri Gelenian was principal of Rivendell Academy, the district's secondary school, from 2010 until February 2024.\n\n\n== Schools ==\nRivendell Academy (secondary school for grades 6-12) - Orford, NH\nIn 2024, the enrollment count was 240.\nSamuel Morey Elementary School - Fairlee, VT\nWestshire Elementary School - West Fairlee, VT\nIn 2023 the school district's board of trustees voted to close Morey Elementary School.

        "content": "The labor movement in Spain began in Catalonia in the 1830s and 1840s, although it was during the Democratic Sexenio when it was really born with the founding of the Spanish Regional Federation of the First International (FRE-AIT) at the Workers' Congress of Barcelona in 1870. During the Restoration, the two major Spanish trade union organizations were founded, the socialist Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT, 1888) and the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT, 1910), with the latter predominating until the Second Spanish Republic. CNT and UGT were the protagonists of the social revolution that took place in the Republican zone during the first months of the Spanish Civil War. During Franco's dictatorship, the two historical centers were harshly repressed until they practically disappeared. In the final stage of Franco's regime, a new organization called Workers' Commissions (in Spanish: Comisiones Obreras) emerged, which together with the reconstituted UGT, will be the two majority unions from the beginning of the new democratic period until the present day.\n\n\n== Workers' movement up to the Spanish Civil War ==\n\n\n=== Origins (1830-1868) ===\n\n\"Insurrections are as old in Spain as the rule of the Palace favorites against whom they have usually been directed\".\nKarl Marx, Revolutionary Spain (New York Daily Tribune, Sept. 9, 1854).The origins of the labor movement in Spain are located in Catalonia in the 1830s and 1840s as it was the only place where there was a modern industry, the cotton textile sector. It was there that the first conflicts between workers and employers took place, and it was there that the first union was founded in 1840 —a friendly society as it was called at the time— in the history of Spain, the Barcelona Weavers Association (Asociación de Tejedores de Barcelona). In a letter dated October 17, 1854, Karl Marx wrote to Friedrich Engels:\n\"The careful study of the Spanish revolutions makes clear the fact that they needed about forty years to demolish the material basis of the domination of the priests and the aristocracy, but in that time they succeeded in making a complete revolution in the old social regime\".Also in Catalonia, the first general strike took place in 1855, during the progressive biennium —a period of extension of the movement to other areas of Spain— and also in Catalonia the first Workers' Congress met in 1865, followed by another in 1868, the latter held after the triumph of the Glorious Revolution of 1868, which by recognizing for the first time freedom of association put an end, at least momentarily, to the persecutions and prohibitions that incipient workerism had suffered during the previous forty years.\nWith the formation in Spain of the first two groups of the First International in 1869, one in Madrid and the other in Barcelona, a new stage in the history of the workers' movement in Spain began, in which, as Manuel Tuñón de Lara warns, \"for the first time, class consciousness was expressed at a level in which the entire system of production relations, institutions and values was called into question\".\n\n\n=== Democratic Sexennium (1868-1874) ===\n\nThe First International (originated in London in 1864) was organized in Spain through the Spanish Regional Federation of the IWA strongly influenced by the Bakuninist International Alliance of Socialist Democracy). Thus, the Spanish labor movement had a preponderance of anarchist sectors, as opposed to the socialist preponderance of most of the rest of Europe.\n\"In Spain, the International was founded first as a simple appendix of Bakunin's secret society, the Alliance, which was to serve as a kind of recruiting base and, at the same time, as a lever to manipulate the entire proletarian movement. You are going to see now that the Alliance is also openly trying today to put the International in Spain back in the same subordinate position in which it had it before.\nBecause of this dependence, the peculiar doctrines of the Alliance: the immediate abolition of the State, anarchy, anti-authoritarianism, abstention from all political acts, etc., were preached in Spain as doctrines of the International. At the same time, every prominent member of the International was suddenly included in the secret organization and imbued with the belief that this system of direction of the public association by the secret society existed everywhere and was a matter of course. [...]\nIn June 1870 the first Congress of the Spanish International was held in Barcelona, where the plan of organization was adopted which was then fully deployed at the Valencia Conference (September 1871), which is in force today and which has already given the best results.\nThe same as in all other places, the participation that our Association had (on a par with that which was attributed to it) in the revolution of the Paris Commune, also gave preponderance to the International in Spain. This preponderance and the first governmental persecutions, which followed immediately afterwards, greatly increased our ranks in Spain. However, at the time the Valencia Conference was convened, there were only thirteen local federations in the country, apart from some isolated sections in various places. [...]\nImmediately after the Valencia Conference, the London Conference was held (September 1871). The Spaniards sent a delegate, Anselmo Lorenzo, and he was the first to bring to Spain the news that the secret Alliance was inconceivable in our Association, and that, on the contrary, the General Council and the majority of the federations were decidedly against the Alliance, for its existence was already known at that time.\"\n\nFriedrich Engels (1872) \"Report of the General Council on the situation in Spain, Portugal and Italy\".In 1870 the FRE-AIT had 30,000 members and the Alliance eventually achieved the domination of the Federation, imposing in the Barcelona Workers' Congress of 1870 the anarchist program: to abstain from political activity (not to create a workers' party and not to vote) and the defense of \"direct action\". Meanwhile, Marxism defended the need for an organized and centralized workers' democracy, and to reach it defended the need for a workers' political party.\n\n\n=== Restoration (1875-1931) ===\n\nThe break between Marx and Bakunin occurred in 1872, leaving the Spanish Federation aligned with the latter, without having created any workers' party, which was supplemented with anti-electoral slogans or with occasional support for the federal republicans. Meanwhile, the minority Marxist group tried to fill this vacuum with the creation of the workers' party PSOE in 1879 and the working class union UGT in 1888. It can be said that in Spain there was no Catholic-social movement properly speaking before the encyclical Rerum novarum of Pope Leo XIII in 1891. The exception would be the workers' unions of the Jesuit Antonio Vicent. In 1895, the workers' circles numbered 169 and their membership exceeded 36,000.\n\nWith the new 20th century, there was a development of the workers' movement, highlighting the industrialization of Asturias, the Basque Country, and Catalonia. At that time there were also divergences in Spanish anarchism. There were anti-union \"purist\" currents, currents in favor of individual terrorism and finally there were anarcho-syndicalist currents, based on the theory of revolutionary syndicalism coherently formulated by French revolutionary theorists.\nIt was in Spain where anarcho-syndicalism managed to create a true mass force. In 1907 the trade union confederation Solidaridad Obrera was founded in Barcelona, of anarcho-syndicalist tendency, and which published an organ of expression of the same name, a newspaper popularly known as the \"Soli\". With the economic recession of 1908-1909, faced with layoffs and wage reduction, the \"Soli\" raises the possibility of a general strike. With the call-up of recruits for the war in Melilla, this strike broke out. The result: the Tragic Week of Barcelona.\nThe anarcho-syndicalists, with control of the \"Soli\", call a National Workers' Congress in Barcelona in 1910. They agreed to create the CNT (National Confederation of Labor), which would become the main mass union of the Spanish working class until the civil war, surpassing the UGT. Composed of unions \"without ideology\" in principle, they have little organizational discipline, trying to avoid the promotion of the strike as an economic weapon to stop the \"direct action\". The anarcho-syndicalist or revolutionary syndicalist character of the CNT was clear.\nThis great trade union center, if in the State as a whole it surpassed the UGT, in Catalonia it became almost the only center (especially important because Catalonia was the largest Spanish working class region). The CNT and the UGT had an almost exclusively working-class character, with very few middle-class intellectuals. Their tone was \"coarse\" and of a decidedly proletarian anti-intellectualism. And yet, the magazines and libraries that their groupings promoted contributed decisively to the culturization of the working class in those years when public education was conspicuous by its absence.\n\nAlthough, theoretically, neither partial nor economic strikes were supported, obviously the member unions of the CNT were immersed in them. If the CNT union, in its rank, had not supported these mobilizations, it would never have been a mass union. It was the class instinct of the class militants which prevailed over the theorizations of \"the leadership\". Evidently, the assembly and federalist character of the organization allowed each federation of the confederation, at the sectoral or local level, to make the decisions it saw fit.\n\nIndustrial strikes were spreading through the north, peasant strikes through Andalusia at the end of the 1910s. This was the atmosphere in which the triumph of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia was received. The Spanish working class, like the world working class, was very impressed with the victory of the Soviet Bolshevik revolution. The impact on the PSOE and the UGT is quite well known, leading to the creation of the first Spanish Communist Party; but not so much is insisted on the fact that it produced great sympathy among the confederal milieus, with the CNT becoming affiliated to the III International for a time.\nThe fact that the Soviet republic functioned in those times through the workers' assemblies or \"soviets\", allowed the Spanish anarcho-syndicalists to see in it the incarnation of their collectivist ideals. The place where the CNT had most influence, Catalonia, had the most active part of the middle class and the most powerful part of the workers' movement. Bourgeois Catalanism pressed hard, and feared at the same time the strength of the workers.\n\nAt the end of the 1910s, the bosses organized throughout Spain against socialism and revolutionary syndicalism. The police were overwhelmed by the workers' movement. Many workers saw individual anarchist terrorism as a provocative maneuver to justify police persecution and repression. The \"white\" terrorism of the bosses' pistoleros made matters worse.\nThe growth of the economy of neutral Spain in World War I strengthened the working class and the CNT. In 1917-18 there was an increase in strike activity. The government banned the \"Soli\" (Solidaridad Obrera, official organ of the confederation), closed workers' centers and arrested leaders. In 1919 there was a strike at the electric company \"La Canadenca\", which spread and produced a general strike in Catalan industry and the countryside. Partial victory of the CNT, after a hard fight. And the mobilization was important: on March 24, 1919 the CNT again called a general strike to free the prisoners of the previous strike. There were three weeks of social struggle in Barcelona and other cities.\n\nThe government reacted with panic and on April 3 the parliament approved the 8-hour working day. The government ordered the formation of mixed negotiation commissions. These were triumphs wrested by the working class with its struggle. But the arrest of trade unionists led to the leadership of the CNT to pure anarchists, who responded to \"white\" terrorism with actions of individual terrorism. This was criticized by many sectors of the same organization. Former policemen of the \"Political-Social Brigade\" were in charge of leading the bosses' gangs of pistoleros against the confederals and workers' organizations in general.\nAt the end of 1919, the government tried to make a pact with the unionist sector of the CNT, but the Federation of Employers raised the \"lock-out\" and the struggle intensified. The bosses formed declassed workers in the Sindicato Libre (ultra-Catholic and favorable to the bosses) against the single unions of the CNT. The gun fight between the two groups produced a new terrorist escalation. The extension of terrorism in 1920, together with the \"lock-outs\" and the general strike called for January 24, produced extreme tension.\nTerrorism and social struggle spread throughout Spain. Also in 1920, the government passed from the reformist line to the hard line, ceasing to negotiate and repressing the CNT, with the police and the army. The criminal \"ley de fugas\" was applied, which allowed the murder of detainees alleging attempted escape. There was a spectacular anarcho-syndicalist response, ending with the assassination in Madrid of Prime Minister Eduardo Dato in early 1921 by three anarchist gunmen. The army reacted brutally against the CNT. In 1922 the violence decreased due to the victory of repression.\n\n\n=== Second Republic and Civil War (1931-1939) ===\nDuring the first two years of the Second Republic, the workers' movement enjoyed a period of relative prosperity, since the authorities were favorable to it, although the economic circumstances were not. It was precisely these circumstances that made the workers impatient, as they did not see all the benefits promised by the Republicans and revolutionary disorders occurred, such as those in Arnedo, Castilblanco and Casas Viejas, which in the long run would harm the workers' movement, as they caused the progressive parties to leave the government.\nThis situation culminated when, after the electoral triumph of the CEDA in November 1933, the social advances obtained in the previous two years began to be cut back, which gave rise to the revolutionary movement of October 1934 and its harsh repression by the government, especially in Asturias and Catalonia.\nThe situation in Europe, with the Nazi and Fascist regimes in government in Germany and Italy respectively and increasing their influence in other countries, motivates the decision of the left-wing trade unions to support the electoral coalition of the Popular Front and the return to the government of the republic of the left-wing parties.\n\n\n== 20th century ==\n\n\n=== Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975) ===\nAfter the Spanish Civil War and during the Francoist period, all the workers' movements and political parties plunged into exile and clandestinity. Their activities were part of the opposition to Franco's regime.\nDuring this period, the social policy of Francoism annulled the reforms of the Republic, especially the agrarian reform, and also returned properties and factories seized in the Republican zone during the war to their former owners. The bodies of vertical unionism gave a clear advantage at all times to the employers, and the workers would only have a chance to defend their interests in directly elected positions (trade union liaisons, company juries from 1954). The State regulated, through the Ministry of Labor, the conditions to which labor relations had to conform, in which the employers could intervene by adapting the regulations of the industry to the specific characteristics of the enterprise.\nThere were, however, some important workers' conflicts since the second half of the forties, such as the general strike of May 1, 1947 in Biscay and Gipuzkoa, encouraged by the Basque Government from exile and seconded by both nationalists and leftists, which were harshly repressed.\nThe rise in prices provoked several labor conflicts: the Barcelona tramway strike of 1951, which spread to several sectors; the general strikes of April of the same year in Biscay and Gipuzkoa, and some other conflicts in Vitoria, Pamplona and Madrid. In addition, there were disturbances in the universities, especially in Madrid in 1956.\nIn the heat of the social changes and of these mobilizations, together with the generational change that took place at that time, new groups of worker activists arose, linked to Christian base movements, Hermandades Obreras de Acción Católica, HOAC, founded in 1946; the Young Christian Workers, (Juventud Obrera Cristiana, JOC).\nThe labor conflict was favored by the Collective Bargaining Law of 1958. It strengthened company juries and the role of union liaisons.\nLabor mobilization favored the growth of a trade union organization: the Comisiones Obreras (CC.OO.), since 1962. The CC.OO. had emerged as a committee, in order to negotiate collective bargaining agreements on the fringes of trade unionism. Other clandestine unions also emerged, such as the Unión Sindical Obrera (USO), formed in 1960 in Asturias and the Basque Country from nuclei of the JOC; it was joined by the survival of the UGT and the CNT in some areas, and the weaker ELA-STV in the Basque Country. From the beginning of the 70s, some other unions appeared, such as the CSUT or the Sindicato Obreiro Galego (SOG).\n\n\n=== Reign of Juan Carlos I (1975-2014) ===\n\nFrom the rupture of the \"unitary syndical current\" with CC.OO. will be originated, driven by the Maoists of the PTE and ORT, Sindicato de Obreros del Campo (among its leaders Francisco Casero, Diego Cañamero and Sánchez Gordillo), Sindicato Obreiro da Construcción de Vigo y La Coruña in Galicia (José Luis Muruzabal Arlegui, member of the PTE, will play a central role in the origin of them). In 1976 representatives of these unions, in an assembly in Barcelona, will create the Confederación de Sindicatos Unitarios de Trabajadores which will be chaired by the Madrid letter carrier Jeronimo Lorente. At the same time the ORT will promote the Unitary Union in March 1977. Both trade union centers opposed, to the extent of their strength, the \"Pactos de la Moncloa\". The CSUT split and dissolved in 1981. The SU, although a minority, still exists.\nOn April 28, 1977, the democratic period of trade union organizations in Spain began. Enrique de la Mata Gorostizaga, then Minister of Trade Union Relations, opened the door to trade union pluralism with the recognition of UGT, CC.OO., USO, ELA-STV, SOC and CNT.\nIn the following years they suffered enmities around what were called \"trade union models\". CC.OO, wanted to capitalize on habits of clandestinity, and UGT, was interested in defending the usual practices and structures of a trade unionism in legality, common to the rest of Europe.\nUGT defended a syndicalist logic, while CC.OO. was of a movementist logic. In reality, the communists discovered during the clandestinity that for them a platform, a movement, was infinitely more operative than a union: for this reason they liquidated the one they had, the OSO (Oposición Sindical Obrera, an organization promoted by the PCE (ml) and member of the FRAP never participated in the CC.OO.), and became part of the CC.OO. But now, in legality, the need to make them a union was inevitably imposed on them. This implied time, a change of mentality and, above all, trying to capitalize on the previous inertia in the new measuring system: the trade union elections of 1978.\nThese ideological struggles not only affected the organizations involved but, as a result, a large part of the USO's militancy joined the UGT in 1977 and the Comisones Obreras in 1980, weakening it considerably. Despite this, it has managed to maintain itself to the point of currently being the third most representative union in Spain.\nFor its part, the National Confederation of Labor (CNT-AIT), which entered the post-Franco period with a spectacular growth, was involved in internal struggles in which two sectors were distinguished, the first and majority sector in which the sector most faithful to the minimum anarcho-syndicalist approaches was incorporated and another minority sector which opted to participate in union elections and works councils, thus accepting the union model imposed by the State. This confrontation provoked a split within the union, creating what is now known as CGT (Confederación General del Trabajo), a name that had to be adopted by judicial sentence, since this second sector claimed to be the continuation of the CNT. Also significant was the police set-up of the Scala Case, blaming the CNT for what happened, provoking a wave of repression and persecution that frightened a large part of the anarcho-syndicalist militancy. The CNT remains faithful to the principles of struggle with direct action that made it the most important Spanish trade union in the 30s and carrying out the social revolution, now despite its limited social presence, maintains not only its principles and impeccable purposes but preserves its anarcho-syndical structure ready for moments of crisis in which the working class can see the CNT as an alternative.\n\n\n=== Current majority unions ===\n\nAt present, the two unions with the largest electoral representation are the Comisiones Obreras (CC.OO.) and the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT).\nThe CC.OO. arose as a result of the Asturian mining strikes of 1962 and 1963 (their first antecedent being the factory commissions of the Basque Country in 1956 and the workers' commission of 1958 in Gijón). Backed by the PCE, they achieved a rapid diffusion and were characterized by fighting, from within, against the vertical unionism of the Central Nacional de Sindicatos. Declared illegal in December 1966, they lost part of their influence during the period of clandestinity, although they once again became the main union after being declared legal in 1977.\nIn the trade union elections of 1978 they had a higher position than the UGT, a predominance which they lost in the trade union elections of 1986 and later regained. In 1987, Antonio Gutiérrez Vergara replaced their historic leader, Marcelino Camacho, as president. Antonio Gutiérrez gave way to José María Fidalgo, who was secretary general of CC.OO until December 2008, when the current secretary general, Ignacio Fernández Toxo, was elected during the 9th congress of CC.OO.\nThe UGT experienced spectacular growth during the Second Republic, which it defended in the big cities after the 1936 uprising. It was declared illegal during Franco's regime, so it lost much of its influence and all its assets. After the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975, it regained legality and from 1986 onwards strengthened its leadership within the Spanish trade union movement. It created a trade union action platform with CC.OO. in 1988 to protest, in the opinion of these unions, against the social-liberal policies of the PSOE, calling a general strike throughout Spain on December 14, 1988, with a massively supportive response from the population. In 1992 they called another general strike, this time for half a day, which had less repercussion than the previous one. During the XXXVI Congress of the UGT (1994), Nicolás Redondo, who had been its secretary general since 1976, was replaced by Cándido Méndez. \n\n\n=== Trade union federations of professional branches with a current strong presence ===\nFrom the 1980s onwards, other trade unions considered to be minorities emerged in Spain, within different professional branches. The most important are:\n\nAST (Alternativa Sindical de Trabajadores).\nANPE (Asociación Nacional de Profesionales de Enseñanza).\nSTEs (Confederación de Sindicatos de Trabajadores de la Enseñanza).\nSTC (Sindicato de Trabajadores de Comunicaciones).\nACAIP (Agrupación de los Cuerpos de la Administración de Instituciones Penitenciarias).\nCSI-CSIF (Central Sindical Independiente y de Funcionarios).\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnarchism in Spain\nAnti-austerity movement in Spain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nTuñón de Lara, Manuel (1977) [1972].

Εθνικός Νέου Κεραμιδίου, Εθνικός Προοδευτικός Σύλλογος Νέου Κεραμιδίου) is a Greek professional football club, based in Neo Keramidi, Greece. It was founded in 1951. The club's home ground is the Neo Keramidi Stadium.\n\n\n== History ==\nEthnikos Neo Keramidi made its first appearance in a national category during the 2020–21 season, securing a 3rd place finish in its group with 25 points. The team played only the first round of matches due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The following season proved challenging, with the team barely avoiding relegation by a single point. In subsequent seasons, Ethnikos Neo Keramidi established itself as a formidable force in the Gamma Ethniki, boasting a strong squad. In February 2023, the club appointed Vangelis Moras, a former international footballer and coach of Apollon Larissa and P.O. Elassona, as its head coach.\nThe 2023–24 season marked the most successful in the club's history. Ethnikos Neo Keramidi won their Gamma Ethniki group and achieved automatic promotion to Super League Greece 2, the second division of Greek football.\n\n\n== Titles ==\nGamma Ethniki (1): 2023–24\nPieria Football Clubs Association First Division (1): 2019–20\nPieria Football Clubs Association Third Division (2): 1990–91, 2008–09\n\n\n== Season by season ==",

        "content": "Margaret Louisa Kempe Howell (January 6, 1806 – November 24, 1867) was an American heiress, planter, and slaveowner who was the mother of Confederate First Lady Varina Davis and mother-in-law of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Upon her marriage to the son of New Jersey Governor Richard Howell, her father granted her a dowry of sixty slaves and two thousand acres of land in Mississippi. She and her husband faced financial difficulties throughout their lives and depended on the support of her family. After their plantation was seized by creditors, they rented a mansion known as The Briars from John Perkins Sr. Following the American Civil War, Howell fled to Canada, where she died.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nHowell was born Margaret Louisa Kempe on January 6, 1806, in Prince William County, Virginia to Colonel James Kempe and Margaret Graham Kempe. Her father, a Scots-Irish immigrant from Ulster, became a wealthy planter and major landowner in Virginia, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Her mother was the illegitimate daughter of George Graham, a Scottish immigrant and planter, and Susanna McAllister, a Virginian woman. Howell's father served as an officer in the Mississippi Commands during the War of 1812, commanding a company at New Orleans and at Pensacola.\nThe Howell family moved from Virginia to Mississippi before 1816 to reside at one of their plantations.\n\n\n== Adult life ==\nIn 1823, she married William Burr Howell, the son of New Jersey Governor Richard Howell, in Natchez. Her father gave her a dowry of two thousand acres of land in Mississippi and sixty slaves. Joseph Emory Davis, a school friend of hers, was a groomsman at the wedding. She later named her first son after him. They had eleven children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. One of her daughters, Varina, would later marry Jefferson Davis, the brother of Joseph, and serve as First Lady of the Confederate States of America.\nIn 1825, Howell and her husband went north to improve the health of their eldest son, Joseph Davis Howell. The Howells were accompanied by Joseph E. Davis and their child's nurse. They traveled in a carriage led by two horse to the crossing of the Ohio River, where they took a boat to Brownsville. During their journey, they met English caricaturist George Cruikshank and the Indiana politician Robert Dale Owen. They eventually reached New York and visited the young Jefferson Davis at West Point.\n\nThroughout their marriage, Howell's husband worked as a planter, merchant, politician, cotton broker, banker, postmaster, and military commissary manager, but never secured long-term financial stability. The majority of Howell's sizable dowry and her inheritance were lost through her husband's bad investments and the couple's lavish lifestyle. Howell's husband declared bankruptcy in 1875 and the family home, furnishings, and slaves were seized by creditors to be sold at public auction.  Howell and her husband continued to have financial problems throughout their lives and depended on her wealthy relatives for support. Howell and her family took up residence at The Briars, a mansion in Natchez that was leased to them by John Perkins Sr. from 1828 to 1850.\nDuring the American Civil War, Colonel John McGavock and Carrie Elizabeth Winder McGavock of Carnton Plantation sent one of their pregnant house slaves, Mariah Reddick, to stay with Kempe at her house in Montgomery, Alabama.\nFollowing the South's defeat in the war, Howell fled to Canada. She helped care for her elder grandchildren while her son-in-law was imprisoned at Fort Monroe.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nHowell died in Quebec on November 24, 1867. She was buried at Cimetière Mont-Royal in Outremont. Some of her belongings, including an étui and a floral needlework appliqué, are housed in the collection of the American Civil War Museum.\n\n\n== Works cited ==\nCashin, Joan (2006).

        "content": "Attorney General of Ontario v Mercer is a Canadian constitutional law decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court of appeal in the British Empire, including Canada.\nThe issue in the case arose from the death of an individual, Andrew Mercer, without a will and without any heirs recognised by law.  At common law, if an individual dies without heirs, the property in the estate vests in the Crown, called an \"escheat\".   Both the federal government and the provincial government claimed the property, each relying on different sections of the British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the Constitution Act, 1867).\nThe dispute was litigated in the courts of Ontario and then the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Ontario courts ruled in favour of the province, and the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the federal government.  The Attorney General of Ontario, Oliver Mowat, QC, then appealed to the Judicial Committee, which held that the right of escheat fell to the provinces, not to the  federal government.\n\n\n== Facts of the case ==\nAndrew Mercer was born in England, likely around 1780.  He emigrated from England to Upper Canada in 1800, accompanying Thomas Scott, the newly appointed Attorney General of Upper Canada.  Mercer once stated that his mother was unmarried, and there was speculation that Mercer was Scott's illegitimate son.  Upon arriving at York, Upper Canada, Scott retained Mercer as his secretary.\nMercer lived in York (later Toronto, Ontario) for the rest of his life.  He held a variety of government positions, as well as some business ventures, including offering loans.  He was said to be \"almost parsimonious\".  He owned a small house near Bay Street and Wellington Street.  In 1850, he hired a new housekeeper, Bridget O'Reilly, who was bad-tempered, illiterate and of a thieving disposition. She remained his housekeeper until the end of his life. In 1851, she gave birth to a boy, commonly believed to be Mercer's son, who was christened Andrew Francis Mercer. Mercer provided support for the boy as he grew up and gave him a plot of land, but never included him in a will.  Mercer was reputed to have said that he \"would leave his money to the government.\"\nMercer died in 1871, without a will (\"intestate\").  His estate was valued in the neighbourhood of $180,000, made up of land, mortgages and other loans, and stocks.  It was not well organised.\n\n\n== Decisions of the Canadian courts ==\n\nFollowing Mercer's death, the Attorney General for Ontario, Oliver Mowat, began proceedings in the Ontario Court of Chancery to claim the lands in Mercer's estate, asserting that since he had died intestate and without any known heirs, the land escheated to the province of Ontario. Andrew Francis Mercer contested the application, arguing that the provincial Escheats Act was unconstitutional because escheats were a matter of federal law, not provincial.  The Vice-Chancellor of the Court of Chancery, Samuel Blake, rejected that application.  Andrew Francis Mercer appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal.\nAndrew Francis Mercer then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The dispute was now seen as a major case in relation to the powers of the federal government and the provincial governments. The Attorney General of Canada joined in the appeal, arguing that escheats of land were within federal jurisdiction, not provincial, and therefore the land should escheat to the federal government.  The Attorney General for Ontario opposed the appeal.  The Attorney General of Quebec intervened in the case, in support of provincial jurisdiction.\nAll of the parties were represented by senior counsel.  The Deputy Minister of Justice, Zebulon Aiton Lash, QC, argued the case for the federal government, while William McDougall, QC, a Father of Confederation and former federal Cabinet minister, argued for Andrew Francis Mercer. The Attorney General for Ontario was represented by Edward Blake, QC, one of the leading Ontario barristers, formerly Premier of Ontario, formerly federal Attorney General, and brother of Vice-Chancellor Blake, whose decision was under appeal.  Blake was joined by James Bethune, QC, of his firm.  The Attorney General of Quebec, Louis-Onésime Loranger, personally argued the position of Quebec.\nMcDougall, counsel for Andrew Francis Mercer, advised the Court that his client favoured the federal government because he understood that the federal government would likely transfer all of the property to him if successful, under a pre-Confederation policy that the federal government would respect.  All counsel made extensive arguments, ranging over the feudal origins of property under English law, Crown prerogatives, the constitutional history of the British North American provinces up to Confederation, and the powers of the federal and provincial governments under the British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the Constitution Act, 1867).\nThe Supreme Court allowed the appeal by a majority of four judges, with two dissenting.  The four judges in the majority (Justices Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne) agreed that the right of escheat is one of the royal prerogatives and a form of revenue.  It therefore was a federal matter under s. 102 of the Constitution Act, 1867 which assigned revenues to the federal government.  As well, they questioned whether the provinces could benefit from the royal prerogative of escheats, since they considered the Crown was represented by the federal government, and not by the provinces.\nThe two dissenting judges, Chief Justice Ritchie and Justice Strong, took the view that escheats were part of property in land, and therefore assigned to the provinces by s. 109 of the Constitution Act, 1867.  Section 109 provides that the provinces continued to hold \"All Lands, Mines, Minerals, and Royalties\" belonging to the provinces before Confederation, which would include the Crown’s right of escheat in land.  They would have upheld the constitutionality of the provincial statute.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Decision of the Judicial Committee ==\n\nAttorney General Mowat appealed to the Judicial Committee.  Mowat appeared personally to argue the appeal, along with Horace Davey, QC, a leading member of the English bar, and two junior counsel, one from Canada and one from England.  The federal government, handling the appeal on behalf of Andrew F. Mercer, was represented by the Solicitor General for England, Farrer Herschell, QC, and the federal Deputy Attorney General, Zebulon Lash, with Francis Jeune as junior counsel.\nLord Selbourne, the Lord Chancellor, gave the decision of the Judicial Committee in favour of Ontario's appeal.  An expert in equity law, he reviewed the historical origins of the doctrine of escheat, as an aspect of feudal tenure and the position of the Crown as the ultimate lord of the property. If there was a complete failure of the tenant's line, the land escheats, or returns to the Crown.  The income from an escheat was  one of the casual revenues of the Crown.\nHe then turned to the major issue:  was an escheat part of the revenues assigned to the federal government by s. 102 of the Constitution Act, 1867, or was it one of the types of property reserved to the provinces by s. 109 of the act?  He noted that s. 102 stated that the revenues transferred to the federal government did not include revenues that the Act \"reserved to the respective Legislatures of the Provinces\".  He concluded that phrase referred to the \"lands, mines, minerals, and royalties\" held by the provinces under s. 109 of the Act.  Finally, he held that the escheat of land was one of the \"royalties\" included in s. 109.  The escheat in land therefore belonged to Ontario, as held by the Ontario courts.  \nAs was the practice of the Judicial Committee at that time, there were no concurring or dissenting reasons from other members of the committee.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\nMuch of the estate was spent on the legal costs.  Following the decision, Mowat agreed to give Andrew Francis Mercer $30,000 from the proceeds of the estate, but most of that went to cover his legal expenses.  The government used $10,000 of the proceeds to set up the Andrew Mercer Eye and Ear Infirmary at the Toronto General Hospital. Another amount, $106,000, was used to set up the Andrew Mercer Ontario Reformatory for Females.  The Reformatory opened in 1880 and continued in existence until 1969.\nThe Supreme Court has cited Attorney General of Ontario v Mercer several times since it was decided, most recently in 2002.\nThis case is included in the three volume set of significant decisions of the Judicial Committee on the construction and interpretation of the Constitution Act, 1867, prepared on the direction of the then Minister of Justice and Attorney General, Stuart Sinclair Garson, QC. Following the abolition of Canadian appeals to the Judicial Committee, Garson directed that the Department of Justice prepare the collection \"for the convenience of the Bench and Bar in Canada\".  This case was included in the first volume of the set.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Treaty of Fontainebleau of 1541 was a treaty of alliance between Denmark–Norway and the Kingdom of France in 1541. The alliance was rewritten in June 1542, and formally ended in 1544 by the Treaty of Speyer, between Denmark-Norway and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1534 Protestant duke Christian of Schleswig-Holstein would be elected king of Denmark as king Christian III. Because a rise of religious tensions in Denmark, Christian would have to face a full-out Civil war, known as the Count's Feud. Christian would eventually win the feud and convert Denmark to Protestantism.\nDuring the conflict, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, had supported the Catholic contender and former king to the throne, Christian II of Denmark. Charles had also supported the contender for Norway, Frederick of Wittelsbach, in opposition to Christian III of Denmark. This, along with religious tensions naturally made Charles V and Christian III enemies, and in 1541 Christian would seek alliance with Charles enemy, Francis I of France.\n\n\n== Stipulations ==\nOn 29 November 1541, Christian and Francis concluded the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In accordance with the treaty, the stipulations were as follows:\n\nBoth promising mutual assistance in case of attack of a foreign enemy\nDenmark guaranteed the closure of the Sound to France's enemies\nIn case of necessity, Denmark would place 1000 men and six vessels at the disposal of France within three months\nIn case of necessity, France would place 2000 men and 12 vessels within four months\n\n\n== Treaty in effect ==\n\nIn 1542 war was declared between the Holy Roman Empire and France, starting the Italian War of 1542–1546. In accordinance with the treaty, Denmark declared war on Charles V. A Danish contingent joined the Franco-Cleves army, which invaded Brabant in July. The sound was closed agains Dutch vessels and a fleet of 26 Danish vessels patrolled the North Sea. After a failed attempt by Hamburg to mediate between the belligerents, a Danish fleet of 40 ships and 10.000 men, set sail for the Walcheren. Yet this fleet would be scattered by a storm. In the Holsteinian-Imperial border, Johann Rantzau prevented an invasion from Germany.\nThough the greatest effect was done by the closure of the Sound. This was the most effective war act by Christian III, because it excluded Dutch towns from trading with the Baltics.\n\n\n== End of treaty ==\nDespite Danish attempts, Francis I accused Denmark of not fulfilling its obligations, and thus when the emperor invited Christian III to the Imperial Diet at Speyer in 1544, Christian willingly accepted, and the Treaty of Speyer was thereafter concluded, ending the Dano-French alliance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTreaty of Speyer (1544) – 1544 treaty between Denmark-Norway and the Holy Roman Empire\nCount's Feud – 1534–36 civil war in Denmark\nChristian II of Denmark – King of Denmark and Norway from 1513 to 1523 and Sweden (1520–1521)\nChristina of Denmark – Duchess-consort of Milan and duchess-consort of Lorraine (1521-1590)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nJespersen, Leon (2012).

        "content": "\"Necio\" is a song by the Argentine rapper and singer Paulo Londra featuring the Argentine rapper and singer Lit Killah. The two artists wrote the track with Big One, who produced it. Warner Music Latina released the song on November 23, 2022, as the tenth and final single from Londra's second studio album, Back to the Game (2022).\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nThe first rumors of a possible collaboration between Londra and Lit Killah emerged in December 2019 when the two artists made a series of social media posts that warned of a future musical work by producer Big One. That month, Paulo published a video showing a fragment of the song alongside the hashtag \"Nitidez\", which indicated the possible name of the song. However, the final production of the song and its release was frustrated by the legal conflict that Londra had with Big Ligas, his former record label that prevented him from releasing music.\nIn June 2021, Lit Killah again referred to the collaboration with Londra via Instagram, assuring that \"when that song comes out we will break it with Paulo\" and added that \"no matter how much he has not made music, he remains the number one in Argentina\". In August 2021, Lit Killah revealed that during the process of composing the single they wrote a second song that would be part of his debut album MAWZ (2021), but could not be included due to Londra's trial with Big Ligas. In November 2021, Lit Killah dedicated his first concert at the Gran Rex to Londra, where she revealed that the rapper was still on trial and asked his fans to give him all their support.\nIn February 2022, after winning the legal battle against his former record label, Londra posted an Instagram story, showing himself working in a recording studio with Lit Killah and Big One, reactivating rumors of a collaboration and possibly the song they had composed in 2019.  In June 2022, Lit Killah confirmed that the collaboration was ready to be published and that it was the song they had written three years ago. On November 17, 2022, Paulo officially announced on his Instagram account the collaboration with Lit Killah, revealing that the title of the song was \"Necio\" and that its premiere would be on November 23, simultaneously with the release of his second album Back to the Game.\n\n\n== Composition and lyrics ==\nThe song was written by Londra and Lit Killah, while the song was produced by Big One. The first version of the song was composed and recorded, in December 2019, in an armed studio in a property located in San Rafael in the province of Mendoza. After the single was released, Lit Killah revealed that several changes were made to the original version to adapt it to the newer musical sounds. The lyric talks about instability in romantic relationships.\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe single, in the first week of December, debuted at number 59 on the Billboard Argentina Hot 100. In its first 24 hours, \"Necio\" managed to get more than two million views on YouTube, which led to it ranked at number 12 of the platform's musical trends in Uruguay and after a week of its debut accumulated more than eight million views, positioning itself in the top places in Argentina.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe video was directed by Agustín Portela and shot in Buenos Aires. The theme of the video shows Londra and Lit Killah as two recruits who take a shy young man to an institution called N.E.C.I.O.: Nueva Escuela de Capacitación Integral de Optimistas (English: New School for the Integral Training of Optimists), where he is assisted by a group of professionals who will prepare him to acquire new forms of communication in order to conquer the girl he feels attracted to, following instructions such as \"do not call\", \"not stalkear\" and \"not unlock\" that are written on a plate and all is done under the supervision of the two artists.\n\n\n== Live performance ==\nOn November 23, 2022, the single was first performed live by both artists in front of fifty thousand people in Las Tejas Park in the city of Córdoba as part of the release of the album Back to the Game. In December 2022, \"Necio\" was featured at the Movistar Arena during the SnipeZ Tour of Lit Killah, where Londra appeared as a guest artist.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits are adapted from Genius.\n\nPaulo Londra – songwriter, vocals\nLit Killah – songwriter, vocals\nBig One – songwriter, musical production, synthesizer, recording engineer, programming\nPatrizio \"Teezio\" Pigliapoco – mix engineer\nDale Becker – mastering engineer\nIgnacio Portales – assistant mix engineer\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hug de Cervelló (died 17 April 1171) was the archbishop of Tarragona from 1164 until his death.\n\nHug was born in the first half of the 12th century. His father was Guerau Alemany IV of the Barony of Cervelló. He became a canon of the diocese of Barcelona. In 1161, he accompanied Count Ramon Berenguer IV on his visit to Turin, during which the count died. He continued to be close to the count's successor, King Alfonso II.\nAlfonso II engineered Hug's election as archbishop in 1164 in order to counterbalance the power of the Bordet princes of Tarragona. Hug did this by granting a charter of repopulation for Selva in 1164; establishing his vassals at L'Albiol and Mas Calvó; becoming the first prior of Escornalbou in 1165; and intervening in disputes, as in that between the bishopric of Urgell and the abbey of Sant Pere d'Àger.\nIn 1165, the conflict between archbishop and prince turned violent and the former requested the intervention of the king, who finally came to Tarragona in 1168. Prince Guillem d'Aguiló was forced to swear fealty to the archbishop, but he was murdered later that year. His family accused Hug of arranging the assassination. In revenge, Guillem's brothers, Berenguer and Robert, had Hug assassinated on 17 April 1171. This resulted in the downfall of the Bordets, who were forced into exile through the intervention of Pope Alexander III. The 18th-century Catalan historian Marià Marí i Bas compared the killing of Hug to that of Thomas Becket the year before for its dramatic consequences in favour of the church.\nIn his will, Hug left 100 bezants to Pope Alexander and 250 morabetinos to Cardinal Hyacinth Bobone.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==",

A political independent, he is also a diplomat who is the current Bulgarian Ambassador to Montenegro. From 2015 to 2019, he headed the Bulgarian consulate in Frankfurt.\nDimitrov faced backlash following his response to the 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel. Reportedly, he didn’t pick up his phone for hours, resulting in him missing calls from the Government and various ambassadors in Bulgaria. As a result, prominent political figures, such as GERB leader Boyko Borisov called for his resignation. Soon after, Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev asked Dimitrov to resign and replaced him with himself as Foreign Minister.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is the official aid organisation of the Catholic Church in Lebanon and implements social welfare services and provides humanitarian aid. It is one of the best-known and largest NGOs in the country and a member of Caritas Internationalis.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCaritas Lebanon's predecessor was established in 1972 by Elie Mamery, a Lebanese Jesuit in Sidon in the South of the country. The initial activities included distribution of primary care items, such as medicines and clothes to families in need in the bordering villages. In the following years, the organisation opened social centres, medical centres and mobile clinics, which became even more important with the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990) and the displacement of people in provoked.\nIn 1976, the organisation took its current name and the bishops and patriarchs of the Catholic Church in Lebanon formally recognized Caritas as the socio-pastoral organ of the Church in Lebanon.\nCaritas Lebanon's network of 60 health and social centres spans across a large part of the country, providing services to both the local population and refugees alike. In addition, its mobile clinics travel up and down the country, especially in rural areas.\nSince the 1990s, Caritas Lebanon has also specialised on supporting migrants and advocating for migrant rights within Lebanon. The Caritas Lebanon Migrant Center (CLMC) assists thousands of migrants every year through services such as psychosocial support, counselling, social assistance, medical aid, legal aid, training, and shelter.\nFollowing the Lebanese liquidity crisis and the subsequent economic downturn, there has been a significant rise in the number of individuals seeking assistance from Caritas.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website (in English and Arabic)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bazel \"Bas\" Buckle (born c. 1948) is a Canadian curler from Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador. He is a two-time World Senior champion. \nBuckle was born in Forteau, Dominion of Newfoundland. \n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Mixed ===\nBuckle won his first provincial championship in 1988, playing second on the Gary Oke mixed team. The team, which also consisted of Laura Phillips at third and Diane Boulanger at lead represented Newfoundland at the 1988 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship, where they finished with a 5–6 record. Oke and Buckle won the provincial mixed championship again in 1989, this time with Cindy Crocker at third and Annette Osborne at lead. The rink went on to represent Newfoundland at the 1989 Canadian Mixed. There, the team went win-less, losing all 11 of their matches.\n\n\n=== Seniors ===\nBuckle did not win another provincial championship until 2002, when he skipped his team of Bob Freeman, Gerry Young and Harvey Holloway to a provincial senior (50+) championship. The rink represented Newfoundland and Labrador at the 2002 Canadian Senior Curling Championships, where they team finished with a 3–8 record. The team won another provincial senior title in 2003, and improved their record at the 2003 Canadian Senior Curling Championships, going 4–7. They won a third straight provincial championship in 2004. The team finally found success at the 2004 Canadian Senior Curling Championships. There, Buckle led his team to an 8–3 round robin record, tied for first place with the defending champion Alberta rink, skipped by Tom Reed. The team earned a bye to the final, where they faced off against Nova Scotia's Team Steve Ogden. They beat Nova Scotia in an extra end in the final, 9–8. This earned the team a trip to Sweden to represent Canada at the 2004 World Senior Curling Championships. There, they went undefeated, and beat the United States (skipped by Bill Kind) in the gold medal game, 8–3. \nDue to the rescheduling of the Canadian and World Senior Championships which resulted in the two events being held at the same time, the Buckle rink were invited to represent Canada again at the 2005 World Senior Curling Championships without having to play at the Canadian Seniors again.  In group play, Buckle led the team to a 5–3 record, putting them in a four-way tie for second place. The team won their tiebreaker game against Germany, then beat Switzerland in the semis  before facing off against the United States once again in the semifinal. They were successful again, defeating the David Russell-led rink 5–4.\nTeam Buckle won another provincial title in 2006. The team could not repeat their success at the 2006 Canadian Senior Curling Championships, going 4–7. Buckle won his final provincial seniors title in 2007 with new third Ken Thomas. At the 2007 Canadian Senior Curling Championships, they finished 4–7 again. \nIn 2008, Buckle broke his ankle and took some time off from curling. \n\n\n=== Post seniors ===\nBuckle won a provincial masters (60+) title with Oke in 2020. He won the Newfoundland and Labrador Curling Club Championship in 2023, and represented the province at the 2023 Canadian Curling Club Championships, where he led his Corner Brook Curling Club team to an 0–6 record. At the event, he stated it would be his last national championship.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBuckle is a retired paper mill worker.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Artigliere (\"Artillerist,\" \"Artilleryman,\" or \"Gunner\") was a Soldato-class (\"Soldier\"-class) destroyer of the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy). Commissioned in 1907, she served in the Italo-Turkish War and World War I. She was stricken in 1923.\n\n\n== Design ==\nArtigliere was powered by two sets of triple expansion steam engines fed by three Thornycroft water-tube boilers, producing an estimated 6,000 indicated horsepower (4,474 kW) and driving two propeller shafts. As built, she could reach a maximum speed of 28.5 knots (52.8 km/h; 32.8 mph). Originally, she had a fuel capacity of 95 tonnes (93 long tons) of coal, giving her a range of 1,500 nautical miles (2,800 km; 1,700 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph) and 400 nautical miles (740 km; 460 mi) at 23.5 knots (43.5 km/h; 27.0 mph); she later was converted to burn fuel oil, with a fuel capacity of 65 tonnes (64 long tons) of oil. She was fitted with four 76-millimetre (3 in)/40 calibre guns and three 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nGaribaldino was laid down on 24 July 1905 at the Gio. Ansaldo & C. shipyard in Genoa, Italy. She was launched on 18 January 1907 and completed on 26 August 1907. She was commissioned in September 1907.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== 1907–1911 ===\nA devastating earthquake in the Strait of Messina and subsequent tsunami struck Messina, Sicily, and Reggio Calabria on the Italian mainland on 28 December 1908. On 30 December 1908 Artigliere, her sister ship Bersagliere, and the battleship Vittorio Emanuele arrived at Messina to assist in rescue operations.\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nThe Italo-Turkish War began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. At the time, Artigliere was in reserve at Taranto under the command of Capitano di fregata Frigate Captain Guido Biscaretti di Ruffia, a future ammiraglio di squadra (squadron admiral). On the afternoon of 29 September Artigliere took part in one of the first clashes of the war, the Battle of Preveza, when she, along with the destroyers Alpino, Carabiniere, and Zeffiro and the torpedo boat Spiga engaged the Ottoman Navy torpedo boats Antalya and Tokad as they attempted to leave the port of Preveza on what then was the Ionian Sea coast of the Ottoman Empire. According to some accounts, the Italian ships attacked the two torpedo boats at 14:00, and Artigliere seriously damaged Tokad and pursued her into the anchorage as she attempted to return to Preveza. Meanwhile, Carabiniere, Alpino, Spiga, and Zeffiro surrounded Antalya. Hit repeatedly, seriously damaged, and on fire, with four members of her crefbetasomw killed in action and numerous other crewmen wounded, Antalya struck her colors and ran herself aground on a nearby beach. As Antalya′s crew abandoned ship, members of Alpino′s crew boarded and captured her and removed her flag and her only usable gun, after which Alpino finished her off with gunfire. Carabiniere, Alpino, Spiga, and Zeffiro then joined Artigliere in the harbor and sank Tokad and an Ottoman gunboat. As the Italian ships departed, the crew of the Greek steamer Marte cheered them. \nIn a 1912 magazine article and a 1913 book based on contemporary sources, United States Navy Commodore W. H. Beehler offers a different version of the events of 29 September 1911. According to Beehler, the Italian ships sighted Antalya and Tokad in the Ionian Sea between Corfu and Preveza, steering north-northwestward, at either 15:00 or 16:00. The Italians opened fire, and the Ottoman ships returned fire only feebly. Tokad steamed northward chased by three Italian destroyers, while Antalya headed south with two Italian destroyers in pursuit. Hit 15 times and on fire, Tokad beached herself near Nicopolis and was totally destroyed, with her commanding officer and eight of her sailors either killed by the Italian gunfire or drowned. Meanwhile, Antalya reached Preveza undamaged. The Italian destroyers were undamaged and fired 100 76-millimetre rounds during the engagement.\nThe battle continued on the morning of 30 September 1911 when, according to some sources, Artigliere was operating off Igoumenitsa with other Italian ships when the Italians sighted a force of Ottoman torpedo boats leaving Preveza. When they reported the sighting to higher command, they received orders to let the torpedo boats move away from the coast and then, taking advantage of the greater speed of the Italian ships, close with them and sink them. The Italian ships managed to surround the torpedo boats, which at that point attempted to escape at full steam towards the south instead of heading back toward Preveza. The Italians found this suspicious, and while Artigliere and her sister ship Corazziere pursued the torpedo boats, Alpino steamed north to conduct a reconnaissance of the approaches to Preveza, where she discovered steamers attempting to reach Prevenza while the Ottoman torpedo boats distracted the Italian ships, and she seized one of the steamers. Meanwhile, Artigliere and Corazziere closed with the Ottoman torpedo boats, which opened fire ineffectively. Artigliere and her sister ships Corazziere returned fire, reducing the torpedo boats Alpagot and Hamidiye to wrecks and inducing an ammuniton magazine explosion aboard one of them. The two torpedo boats struggled back to port and sank there, and the two Italian destroyers rescued some members of their crews. Those members of their crews who reached a nearby beach opened rifle fire on the two Italian destroyers, which returned fire and silenced them. Other Ottoman torpedo boats that had been operating with Alpagot and Hamidiye returned safely to port. Meanwhile, Artigliere and Corazziere captured the armed yacht Teties (referred to as \"Thetis\" or \"Tarabulus\" in some sources) and captured her; she later was incorporated into the Regia Marina as the gunboat Capitano Verri.\nBeehler provides a different narrative stating an officer from Corazziere went ashore at Prevenza on the evening of 29 September 1911 and ascertained the positions at which Alpagot and Hamidiye were anchored, which he reported to di Ruffia. Artigliere and Corazziere penetrated the harbor on the morning of 30 September, where Artigliere and Corazziere sank Alpagot and Hamidiye with gunfire while they were at anchor; all but one man from the two torpedo boats' crews escaped to shore. Corazziere then made preparations to tow the armed yacht \"Telied\" away as a prize, and a \"mob\" on shore opened fire on her. She returned fire, silencing the mob and damaging the fort at Prevenza, which did not fire during the battle. The two destroyers then put back to sea with the yacht in tow, having fired 76 shells in an engagement lasting 45 minutes.\nThe historian Charles Stephenson offers yet another version of events. According to him, the Italians decided not to attempt an incursion into the harbor at Preveza to attack Antalya after she reached that port on 29 September and instead proceeded to the waters off Igoumenitsa, where Alpagot and Hamidiye were anchored in the harbor. Alpino, Artigliere, and Corazziere penetrated the harbor at Igoumenitsa on the morning of 30 September, where Artigliere and Corazziere sank Alpagot and Hamidiye with gunfire while they still were at anchor. Meanwhile, Alpino came alongside the armed yacht \"Trablus,\" whose boilers were under repair. The yacht's crew opened her seacocks in an attempt to scuttle her and abandoned ship. Alpino sent a boarding party aboard the yacht and closed the seacocks to prevent her from sinking. The Alpino crewmen were cutting the yacht's mooring lines when civilians on shore opened fire on the boarding party, prompting Corazziere to bombard the town, silencing the civilian gunfire and damaging the fort at Igoumenitsa, which did not fire during the battle. Alpino then towed the yacht out of port.\nOn 5 October 1911, a motorboat from Artigliere that had been searching an Austro-Hungarian mail steamer in the harbor at Shëngjin (known to the Italians as San Giovanni de Medua) on the coast of Albania came under fire from field guns in an earthwork. Artigliere responded by bombarding the earthwork, silencing its guns and damaging a number of buildings in the city of Shëngjin. Artigliere, which suffered minor damage before silencing the earthwork, ceased fire after 45 minutes when she ran out of ammunition. Meanwhile, Carabiniere arrived on the scene and also opened fire, bombarding the earthwork for 20 minutes before departing.\nIn January 1912 Artigliere, her sister ship Garibaldino,  and the protected cruiser Piemonte deployed to the Red Sea to search for Ottoman ships along the coast. On 7 January 1912 Artigliere came across a large group of Ottoman ships – the gunboats Ayintag (or Antep), Bafra, Gökçedağ, Kastamonu, Ordu, and Refahiye, the armed tug Muha, and the armed steam yacht Şipka (formerly Fuad, Fauwette, or Fouvette) — in the harbor at Kunfuda on the coast of the Arabian Peninsula. The Ottoman vessels moved to attack Artigliere, and Garibaldino and Piemonte rushed to her aid. The ensuing clash, the Battle of Kunfuda Bay, lasted for three hours. Opening fire at a range of 4,500 metres (4,900 yd), the Italians sank three of the gunboats and forced the other three to beach themselves to avoid sinking, their crews fleeing after reaching shore. Sources do not mention the fate of Muha. On 8 January, the Italian ships returned and put ashore landing parties which completed the destruction of the beached gunboats after salvaging guns and trophies from them. The ships then bombarded Kunfuda and captured four Arab dhows. After the Ottoman troops in the area fled, a landing party from Piemonte occupied the town. Sources are unclear as to whether Şipka sank or remained afloat during the events of 7–8 January, but agree that the Italians seized her as a prize, towed her to Massawa, and later took her to Italy, where she was incorporated into the Regia Marina as the gunboat Cunfuda.\nThe war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Artigliere, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) De Grossi, was part of the 3rd Destroyer Squadron, based at Brindisi, which also included Bersagliere, Corazziere, Garibaldino, and their sister ship Lanciere. On 29 May 1915 Artigliere, Bersagliere, Garibaldino, and Lanciere bombarded the Adria Werke chemical plant in Monfalcone, a production site for poison gases, while Alpino, Corazziere, and their sister ship Pontiere provided support.\n The ships carried out another bombardment of the Adria Werke on 7 June 1915.\nArtigliere continued her World War I service without participating in any other significant events. By late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended a week later with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n=== Post-World War I ===\nArtigliere was reclassified as a torpedo boat on 1 July 1921. She was stricken from the naval register on 14 June 1923 and subsequently scrapped.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBeehler, W. H. (1913).

        "content": "Jagadish Chandra Bose: The Reluctant Physicist (ISBN  9389136997) is a contemporary biography of the Indian polymath, Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, modern India’s first scientist, an eclectic pioneer in radio science, and the father of Plant Neurobiology. Written by the Indian author, Sudipto Das, this marks Das's debut in non-fiction after three novels. Published in November 2023 by Niyogi Books, it was launched in Bangalore at the Bangalore Literature Festival on December 3, 2023, and in Calcutta on January 11, 2024. \n\nThe book poignantly chronicles Bose's championing of India’s self-reliance through scientific research despite British racism and prejudice against Indian science. Bose designed innovative instruments for his experiments, prioritising open sharing over patents—a forerunner of today’s open innovation. Already a poster boy of the India Semiconductor Mission, hailed as a trailblazer in the technology that was a precursor to semiconductors, Bose’s depiction in the book resonates well with the government’s emphasis on self-reliance in the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) ecosystems in the country.\n\n\n== Author ==\nSudipto Das, an IIT Kharagpur alumnus and a veteran in the semiconductor industry, is also an entrepreneur, musician, social worker, columnist, and speaker at TED events.\nBorn in Calcutta in 1973 to a family that fled Bangladesh during the partition riots of 1947, Sudipto grew up listening to horrid stories of the partition, something he extensively used later in his debut novel, The Ekkos Clan, published in 2013. A violinist trained in Western classical music, Sudipto debuted as a music composer in 2014 when he recreated Eastern European melodies of the 1940s for the war musical Schweyk in the Second World War by Bertolt Brecht.\n\n\n== The Elements ==\n\n\n=== Summary ===\nA forgotten genius, Sir J. C. Bose defied norms in science and life. A co-inventor of radio and pioneer in semiconductors and wireless communication, he fascinated Einstein yet faded from memory. Das's book delves into Bose's remarkable life, intertwined with India's struggle for freedom, and explores his complex relationships, especially with Sister Nivedita and Sara Chapman Bull, that defied easy definition.\n\n\n=== Narrative ===\nPraised for its captivating narrative, the book transcends the boundaries of a conventional scientific chronicle by exploring India’s socio-political milieu. The poetic eloquence that makes the book read more like a novelistic story bridges the gap between science writing and a broader readership.\n\n\n=== Historical Context ===\nBose lived in the best of times and the worst of times, in many ways. It is the high noon of the British Empire, a defining time for great science and innovation, yet major European powers battle for global dominance and hurtle unwittingly towards devastating wars. Bose’s story unfurls against this and the rising ferment of Indian nationalism. On the one hand, we see glimpses of a young Rabindranath Tagore leading the first non-violent mass resistance against the imperial decree of partitioning Bengal, and, on the other hand, the enigmatic figure of Sister Nivedita, aka Margaret Noble, an Irish-Scottish who, inspired by the firebrand monk Swami Vivekananda, converts to the cause of Hindu nationalism and sparks an armed revolution against British rule. At the same time, Nivedita is liaising with the unitarian and pacifist Bose, often acting as his scientific secretary and editing his papers.\nThe book explores this odd partnership of very antipodal characters, collaborating and influencing each other in unseeming ways, not always in mutual agreement, yet in ways that, nevertheless, transcend their differences in a grand and unified vision to make India independent and self-reliant. \nThe book expertly contextualises Bose’s life within the broader canvas of India’s struggle for independence.\n\n\n=== Spirituality ===\nThe book is divided into four parts, each exploring the theme of unity.\nBose belonged to the Unitarian Brahmo fraternity, like Rabindranath Tagore, Raja Rammohan Roy, and other eminent Bengalis. Brahmoism was founded on the principles of Advaita Vedanta, the genesis of which is in these words from a verse in the Rig Veda: \"Ekam sat, vipra vahudha vadanti,” there exists only One, the wise call it variously. Das gives vivid records of how, driven by this idea of universal unity, Bose explored similarities in plant and human life. He even predicted plant sentience, paving the way for plant neurobiology and cognition.\n\n\n=== \"Boseian\" Myth ===\nDas delves deep into the controversy surrounding the invention of radio or wireless, which, for a very long time, was attributed solely to the genius of Marconi, but not any more. IEEE has formally acknowledged that Bose is the father of wireless communication with millimetre-waves, used again in 5G. It is his work, done in the late 19th century, that forms the foundation of technologies that power devices ranging from cellphones to microwave ovens, radios to radar, satellite television to the world’s most powerful space telescopes.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nA reviewer pointed out that the subtitle of the book, “The Reluctant Physicist,” bears significant semblance to Mohsin Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist. He conjectured that Das might have taken some inspiration from the metafictional elements and autodiegetic narration of Hamid’s original. However, bearing in mind the rather “defiant” nature of Bose and his work, which outweighs his “reluctance” to follow narrow lines of inquiry, the reviewer suggested that “The Defiant Physicist” would seem like a much more apt subtitle.\n\n\n== Review & Comments ==\n“An insightful and illuminating exploration of the life and thought of one of the greatest scientific minds that India has ever produced,” said Jug Suraiya, senior journalist, Times of India.\n“Truly delighted that Sudipto has resurrected an amazing character—a scientist and maverick—who personifies an important turn in Indian history when the likes of Vivekananda and Tagore were laying the intellectual foundations of modern India,” said eminent economist and writer Sanjeev Sanyal.\n“[The] book on Jagadish Chandra Bose looks beyond his scientific contribution, providing a vivid portraiture of the legend’s life. [...] Jagadish Bose comes alive in flesh and blood. [...] Reads like a novel,” said Times of India.\n\"More interesting was [Bose’s] personal relationship with Rabindranath Tagore and Sister Nivedita, and how he helped resurrect literature and art while simultaneously indulging in science during the Bengal Renaissance,” said the Telegraph.\n[Getting] under the skin of the person […] naturally brought out his multiple facades, from a hunter chasing tigers in the Terai jungles to sculling in the freezing waters of the Cam River in Cambridge, writing the first Himalayan travelogue in any language, influencing Tagore to write poems inspired by stories of love and sacrifice from Indian history and mythologies, or even surreptitiously keeping quiet when, he perhaps knew, lab aides planted by Sister Nivedita in Presidency College were regularly taking out explosive materials from the laboratory to make bombs,” said the Hindu.\n“In the riveting biography, […] readers are treated to a comprehensive exploration of the life and times of a man who stood at the crossroads of science, philosophy, and India’s history,\" said the Deccan Herald.\n\"Bose, much before Gandhi, had his own moment of ‘Satyagraha,’” said the Press Trust of India.\n“The book’s true worth lies in its exposition of Bose’s ‘inner life’,\" said the Business Standard.\n“Sudipto Das bridges the gap between science writing and a broader readership to provide a very accessible story about one of the greatest sons of our nation,\" said the Firstpost.\n\n\n== Reference ==",

        "content": "Max Baker-Hytch (born 30 July 1986) is a British analytic philosopher, Christian theologian, and fellow of Wycliffe Hall, University of Oxford. He possesses significant influence on analytic theology, epistemology, and philosophy of religion. He also proactively defends Christianity and engages in contemporary debates on theological or religious matters such as the existence of god on social media.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMax Baker-Hytch completed the Bachelor of Arts in theology with philosophy at the University of Exeter, graduating with first class honours. He continued his studies at the same university, obtaining the Master of Arts in ethics, religion, and society with distinctions in 2010. During this period, he also established a musical ensemble and fulfilled the role of guitarist. His music successfully gained the media attention, including coverage by the BBC.\nIn 2014, he attained the Doctor of Philosophy degree from St Cross College, University of Oxford, under the supervision of Brian Leftow. His thesis titled Reformed Epistemology and Naturalistic Explanations of Religious Belief maintains a comparatively high rate of citations and is considered a phenomenal contribution to the field.\nFrom 2014 to 2015, he held the position of research fellow at Somerville College, University of Oxford, where a research was conducted on the project of new insights and directions in religious epistemology. He then spent an ephemeral period of time in Indiana, United States, where he served as a research fellow at the University of Notre Dame. Upon his return to Oxford in 2016, he was appointed as a tutorial fellow at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, where he continues his academic research and lectures mature students on philosophy.\n\n\n== Ideas ==\n\n\n=== Mutual epistemic dependence ===\nBaker-Hytch contends that mutual epistemic dependence is an essential mechanism for human acquisition of knowledge. Due to the limited cognitive faculties, human beings indispensably depend on fellow creatures' testimony about the external world and are inevitably susceptible to the influence and beliefs of contemporaries, especially in regard to propositions which are neither empirically verifiable nor falsifiable, such as religious or theological matters. He claims that mutual epistemic dependence provides an optimal equilibrium between three distinct sets of competing attributes: (1) interpersonal trust and precautions against deception, (2) accountability for individual advancement of knowledge and epistemic self-reliance, and (3) potential acquisition, cultivation, and refinement of intellectual virtues and the capacity to overcome and eliminate intellectual hurdles and obstacles. Mutual epistemic dependence implies that theism is comparatively plausible due to the strong probability of the diverse distribution of knowledge and the indeterminacy of the eternal fate of human beings which is not solely based on their beliefs at the time of their natural deaths.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Graphic Nature are a British nu metalcore band, based in Kent, England. The band's style mixes nu metal and metalcore with influences of electronic music, whilst its lyrics are themed around mental health. After self-releasing four singles, the band signed to Rude Records in 2021. The band released their debut album A Mind Waiting to Die in 2023, which they supported with performances at the 2000trees, Download, Reading & Leeds and Misery Loves Company festivals. Their second album, Who Are You When No One is Watching?, will be released on 12 July 2024.  \n\n\n== History ==\nGraphic Nature were formed in mid-2018 by vocalist Harvey Freeman, guitarists Pete Woolven and Matas Michaliovskis, bassist Charlie Smith and drummer Jack Bowdery. Whilst Freeman is from London, the other members of the band are based in Kent, England. Prior to forming Graphic Nature, Woolven, Smith and Bowdery had played together in the metalcore band Cove, whilst Freeman had played drums in various bands before becoming a vocalist around 2015. The band took their name from the Deftones song of the same name, from their seventh album Koi No Yokan (2012). Over the course of a year, the band wrote between five or ten songs in a variety of styles, ranging from metalcore to hardcore. After Woolven sent the band a rough demo of \"Grit\", they decided to pursue a nu metal sound. In 2022, Freeman told Rock Sound:Nu metal was such a big influence on us [...] We were playing music we didn't love as much as the music we grew up with, and if you're not playing something you enjoy then what's the point [in] playing it? So we decided to put more 90's riffs into it, and more electronics.Graphic Nature released their debut single, \"Grit\", on 21 August 2019. By February 2020, the band had released two more singles, \"Mortal Fear\" and \"Dis[in]fect\", and played a number of shows supporting larger bands including Creature, Gassed Up, Heart of a Coward, Lock & Key, Monasteries, MTXS and Palm Reader. Of the reception to Graphic Nature's music, Freeman said that the audiences they played to \"either fucking [loved] it or [had] no idea what to do.\" The band began writing material again in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, with the plan of releasing two EPs in one year. Freeman said that the lockdowns helped the band's members \"find [their] own segments\", and it inspired him to write about his experiences and challenges with mental health and isolation during the pandemic. In August 2021, Graphic Nature signed to Rude Records, who reissued the band's back catalog of singles. \nOn 25 February 2022, Graphic Nature released their debut EP, New Skin. During 2022, the band played shows with Employed to Serve, Ho99o9, Cancer Bats, Witch Fever, Vended, Vexed and SeeYouSpaceCowboy. By the time the EP was released, the band were already working on new material in the studio, and the planned second EP was turned into the band's debut album, A Mind Waiting to Die. The band planned on releasing the album in September 2022, but it was pushed back to avoid competing with Slipknot, who were releasing an album in the same month. The album was released on 17 February 2023, receiving mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. Kerrang! and Rock Sound both listed the album as one of the best of 2023, and both it and Graphic Nature received nominations in the \"Best Breakthrough Album\" and \"Best UK Breakthrough Live Artist\" categories at the Heavy Music Awards 2024. Following its release, Graphic Nature performed at the 2023 editions of the 2000trees, Download, Reading & Leeds and Misery Loves Company festivals.\nOn 4 April 2024, Graphic Nature announced their second album Who Are You When No One is Watching? and released the single \"To the Grave\". The album was partially inspired by Freeman's struggles with PTSD after he was physically assaulted in early 2023. The band wrote the album quickly after the release of their first as they were on a creative spree; by the time of its announcement, some of their songs were still untitled and/or unmixed. It is scheduled for release on 12 July 2024. In July 2024, the band will embark on a headlining tour in the leadup to the Radar Festival in Manchester.\n\n\n== Musical style and themes ==\nGraphic Nature have been described nu metalcore, and as nu metal and metalcore separately. In his review of A Mind Waiting to Die, Tim Bolitho-Jones of Distorted Sound noted a \"techno/electronica edge to [the band's sound] reminiscent of the likes of Pitchshifter and Senser.\" Metal Hammer also noted the album's use of electronic samples. Freeman has described the band's music as \"a mix of nu metal and hardcore with some garage and [drum and bass] influences\", and said that its members were collectively influenced by 90's nu metal bands including Korn, Deftones, Ill Niño, Limp Bizkit, P.O.D. and Slipknot. Additional influences include film soundtracks and the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy video game series. The band's lyrics are centered around mental health, inspired by Freeman's experiences with anxiety, loneliness, depression, neurodivergence and living with Aspergers' syndrome and ADHD.\nThe band's creative process begins with Pete Woolven writing guitar parts with a rough drum track, before Freeman adds lyrics and demoes the track from his home. Freeman has described his creative process as unscheduled and largely spontaneous: \"Whenever something hits me I have to write it down [...] There’s a vibe that comes with that which you only get at night when you’re alone with your thoughts. It’s not always the best thing – when those darker thoughts come out, things can feel pretty bad – but it adds a realism to our music.\" Afterwards, the band engages \"a lot of back and forth with ideas\" before arriving at the finished result.\n\n\n== Band members ==\nHarvey Freeman – vocals\nPete Woolven – guitars\nMatas Michaliovskis – guitars\nCharlie Smith – bass\nJack Bowdery – drums\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\n\nCompilation albums\n\nEPs\n\nSingles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGraphic Nature at Rude Records",

        "content": "The Third Balochistan conflict refers to an insurgency by Baloch separatists against the Pakistani government lasting from 1963 till 1969 with the aim to force Pakistan to share revenues from gas reserves in Balochistan, freeing up of Baloch prisoners and dissolution of one unit policy.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the introduction of a new constitution in 1956 which limited provincial  autonomy and enacted the 'One Unit' concept of political organisation in Pakistan. Tension continued to grow amid consistent political disorder and instability at the federal level. Multiple Baloch parliament members were dismissed. The federal government tasked the Pakistan Army with building several new bases in key areas of Balochistan.\n\n\n== Insurgency ==\nSher Muhammad Bijrani Marri led like-minded militants into guerrilla warfare from 1963 to 1969 by creating their own insurgent bases. Their goal was to force Pakistan to share revenue generated from the Sui gas fields with the tribal leaders and lifting of One Unit Scheme. The insurgents bombed railway tracks and ambushed convoys and raided on military camps.\n\n\n=== PFAR ===\n\nPopular Front for Armed Resistance, or PFAR, was a terrorist outfit formed during the 1960s. The group is responsible for series of bomb blasts in Pakistan. Most of outfit's activists were trained in Afghanistan. For the outfit, Afghanistan was good place to obtain weaponry and others goods.\n\n\n=== Parrari ===\n\nParrari or Parari was a terrorist outfit founded by Sher Mohammad Marri in the 1962. The outfit was responsible for series of attacks against Pakistani civilians and security forces. The outfit continued its attacks until 1969..Sher Mohammad Marri was the first Baloch to use the tactics of modern guerrilla warfare against the government. In early 1960s his Parari fighters attacked the Pakistani Armed Forces in the Marri area and in Jahlawan under Mir Ali Muhammad Mengal. This campaign came to an end in 1967 with the declaration of a general amnesty.\n\n\n=== Bugti militia ===\n\nBugti militia also actively partook in this conflict against Pakistan armed forces.\n\n\n=== BLF ===\n\nBalochistan Liberation Front the group was founded by Jumma Khan in 1964 in Damascus, and played an important role in the 1968–1973 insurgency in Sistan and Baluchestan province of Iran which ultimately spilled over into Pakistan with BLF launching raids on Pakistani outposts. Iraq openly and quite actively supported this group against Pakistan and Iran by providing financial support, weapons and training which ultimately led to 1973 raid on the Iraqi embassy in Pakistan. Syria also provided support to this group.\n\n\n== Military response ==\nThe Pakistan Army retaliated by destroying the militant camps. Pakistan Army bombed multiple villages with separatist presence. Pakistan Air Force also led a bombing campaign  on the tribal areas with separatist presence which \nnot only destroyed multiple separatist bases  but also destroyed vast agricultural farmland.\n\n\n== Ceasefire and Aftermath ==\nThis insurgency ended in 1969, with the Baloch separatists agreeing to a ceasefire granting general amnesty to the separatists as well as freeing the separatists. In 1970 Pakistani President Yahya Khan abolished the \"One Unit\" policy, which led to the recognition of Balochistan as the fourth province of West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan), including all the Balochistani princely states, the High Commissioners Province, and Gwadar, an 800 km2 coastal area purchased from Oman by the Pakistani government.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Spirocuta (from Latin  spira 'coil, spire', and  cutis 'skin') is a clade of euglenids, single-celled eukaryotes or protists belonging to the phylum Euglenozoa. They are distinguished from other euglenids by active deformation of their cell shape, a process called euglenid motion or metaboly. This is made possible by a high number of spirally arranged protein strips that run below their cell membrane and confer the cell with flexibility. These strips compose the helicoidal pellicle, a trait referenced by the alternative name Helicales.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSpirocuta is a group of flagellates, unicellular eukaryotes or protists with one or two flagella for locomotion in the anterior region of the cell. The move through a gliding motion in contact with the substrate to propel the cell forward. Like other members of the Euglenida, their cells are lined by a pellicle composed of proteinaceous strips that interlock with each other, and are spirally arranged underneath the cell membrane. In particular, members of Spirocuta share a synapomorphy, or unique trait: their high number of strips (between 16 and 56) confers the cells with an immense flexibility, allowing them to actively stretch and deform. This process is known as metaboly or euglenid motion.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nSpirocuta was first proposed by American protozoologist Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 2016, as a superclass uniting all those euglenids with more than 15 spirally arranged pellicle strips. It was named in reference of this characteristic, from Latin  spira 'coil, spire', and  cutis 'skin'. It contained two classes: Euglenophyceae, a monophyletic group of phototrophs, and Peranemea, a paraphyletic group of heterotrophs. Later, Peranemea was separated into two distinct clades: Peranemida, a group of phagotrophs whose monophyly is yet to be proven, and Anisonemia, which contains various phagotrophs and a clade of osmotrophs known as Aphagea. In 2017, Stefan Paerschke and colleagues independently noticed the same clade through phylogenetic analyses, and named it Helicales in reference to the helical pellicle composed of spirally arranged strips. The following cladogram depicts the evolutionary relationships of Spirocuta according to phylogenetic studies published in the early 2020s:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Zachary Kristofak (born December 8, 1997) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2024.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKristofak attended George Walton Comprehensive High School in Marietta, Georgia. The Atlanta Braves selected him in the 37th round of the 2016 MLB draft, but he did not sign and instead enrolled at the University of Georgia, where he played college baseball for the Georgia Bulldogs. In three seasons with the Bulldogs, Kristofak had a 12-3 win-loss record, a 4.29 earned run average, and 12 saves.\nThe Los Angeles Angels selected Kristofak in the 14th round of the 2019 MLB draft. After he signed with the Angels, Kristofak pitched for the Orem Owlz of the Rookie-level Pioneer League before he spent two seasons with the Tri-City Dust Devils of the Class A-Advanced Northwest League. He played for the Rocket City Trash Pandas of the Class AA Southern League in 2023. As a relief pitcher, he had a 2.12 ERA in 17 innings before they moved him into the starting rotation. Kristofak made six starts for Rocket City before an injury ended his season. He began the 2024 season with the Salt Lake Bees of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League.\nThe Angels promoted Kristofak to the major leagues on April 28, 2024. He made his major league debut that day, pitching two innings of relief.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nZac has an older brother, Harrison. In December 2012, when Kristofak was 15 years old, his father, John, murdered his mother, Donna. His parents had divorced in August 2011 and his father had been imprisoned in March 2012 for stalking his mother. Kristofak stayed with the family of his neighbor and high school teammate, Carter Kieboom, in the days following the murder. John was sentenced to life in prison in 2013.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCareer statistics and player information from Baseball Reference (Minors)",

        "content": "Sarah Jane Farmer (1847-1916) was the founder of the Greenacre Conferences in Eliot, Maine, U.S. After her death, Greenacre became the Green Acre Baháʼí School.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSarah Jane Farmer was born in Dover, New Hampshire, July 22, 1847, the only child of Professor Moses G. Farmer and Hannah Tobey (Shapleigh) Farmer. She was raised in the Unitarian religion in this New England family.\nShe graduated from Salem, Massachusetts High School, 1868, followed by instruction by private tutors, 1868-81. In young adulthood, she lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Newport, Rhode Island.\nHaving moved to Eliot, Maine with her parents, in 1887, she worked on the establishment of a public library in that city.\n\nAfter attending the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893 with her father, Farmer decided to establish Greenacre, with the support of her acquaintances in the New Thought, women's clubs, and women's suffrage movements, as well as several Ralph Waldo Emerson societies. In 1894, she founded Greenacre Conferences at Eliot, Maine, which resembled a Chautauqua. The Greenacre Conferences were anchored by two annual schools, the Monsalvat School of Comparative Study of Religion (established by Farmer in 1896) and the revived Concord School of Philosophy. In addtiion, the Greenacre Conferences offered lectures by instructors in various fields. These afforded annual assembly for lectures by leaders of advanced thought, American, European and Oriental. \nThe Greenacre Colony attracted wide attention because of its free discussion of religious subjects. Many clergymen and writers were identified with her organization. It was almost disrupted, however, by factional differences.\nFarmer engaged in European travel in 1886, 1893, 1900.  It was during her trip in 1900 that she met ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, and became a member of the Bahá’í faith.\nSarah Farmer made her home at Green Acre, Maine. In 1910, she was declared insane and sent to an asylum. Since that time, her mental condition was the subject of litigation. She died at the family homestead in Eliot, Maine on November 23, 1916, age 70.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\"The Abundant Life\", The Spirit of The New Thought, by Sarah J.

The name comes from the pejorative word for a Russian vatnik which refers to the cold-weather army clothes that Russian soldiers wear, but has since recently being used to refer to supporters or fellow travellers of Vladimir Putin or Ruscism. \nSince starting in 2022, Pekka has compiled over 200 threads of people and organisations, mainly useful idiots who have been distributing Russian disinformation, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on social media. Initially it was local Finnish fellow travellers including Johan Bäckman  but now including people such Max Blumenthal and Viktor Orbán, and more controversially public figures seen to have soft stances towards Russia, like Pope Francis. It is now seen as part of the NAFO counter-disinformation network against Russian disinformation.\n\n\n== Notable threads ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nIT Army of Ukraine\nRussian web brigades\nRusso-Ukrainian cyberwarfare\nSaint Javelin\nVatnik\n\n\n== External links ==\nVatnik Soup\n\n\n== References ==\n Text was copied from Vatnik Soup at Rational Wiki, which is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (Unported) (CC-BY-SA 3.0) license.",

        "content": "William Ahmed is an American entrepreneur best known as the CEO of health wearables company WHOOP, which he founded in 2012.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAhmed grew up in Long Island, New York. He attended high school at St. Paul's School in Concord, NH. He went on to graduate from Harvard College, where he studied government and was the captain of the squash team.  \n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2012, while a student at Harvard, Ahmed began developing new wearable technology that would allow athletes to measure recovery and optimize performance. According to Ahmed, he began creating the technology after reading dozens of medical papers. The company's first wearable device launched in 2015. Ahmed pursued a strategy of selling the product to top sports teams and athletes before marketing to the broader consumer base in order to generate a \"halo effect\" for the brand.  \nIn 2021, the company was valued at $3.6 billion. Under Ahmed's leadership, WHOOP has recruited investors including SoftBank, IVP, Eli Manning, Patrick Mahomes, and Larry Fitzgerald.\nIn 2022, Ahmed publicly claimed victory over Amazon in the wearable competition after Amazon discontinued its Halo wearable product. He alleged that Amazon's Halo band was a knockoff of the WHOOP device. Amazon publicly denied the allegations.  \nIn 2023, Ahmed was appointed to the Harvard Medical School Board of Fellows. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAhmed is married to Leily Amirsardary, an Iranian fashion designer. They married in 2018 during a three-day wedding in Cannes.  \nAhmed is an avid golfer. He has previously played in the Waste Management Phoenix Open Pro-Am. \nAhmed's father is Egyptian.  He immigrated to the United States and worked in the financial services industry.\n\n\n== References ==",

It comprises an area of 27.59 hectares (68.2 acres). It is centred on Oxford Road and St Agnes' Church, Moseley.\nThe opening of Moseley railway station in 1867 started a property boom in Moseley, which was accelerated by the arrival of steam driven tramway services to Birmingham along the Alcester Road provided by the Birmingham Central Tramways Company Ltd which started operating on 29 December 1884. Moseley was an attractive location for the prosperous middle-classes, as it was situated south of Birmingham upwind of the industrial smoke of the city. The conservation area comprises a number of streets developed from the 1860s to the 1930s with a wide variety of architectural styles ranging from Victoria and Edwardian villas, and Arts and Crafts houses built by local architects such as William de Lacy Aherne and J. Brewin Holmes.\n\n\n== Notable buildings and structures ==\n\n\n=== Billesley Lane ===\nPairs of houses 1923-26 by George Payton\n51-57, by Daniell & Berrill 1905\n71-81, by George Payton 1923-26\n\n\n=== Colmore Crescent ===\nThe crescent was named after the Vicar of Moseley, Canon William Colmore.\n\nSt Agnes' Church, Moseley 1884 by William Davis\n1, Tudor Lodge by Owen Parsons 1916\nVicarage to St Agnes’ Church, by Charles Edward Bateman 1922-23\n\n\n=== Cotton Lane ===\n59, Fernlea by William de Lacy Aherne 1902\n61, Clavendon by William de Lacy Aherne 1902\n63, Rathen by William de Lacy Aherne 1902\n65, Tresco by William de Lacy Aherne 1902\n67, by William de Lacy Aherne 1899\n71, 73, 75, 77 by William de Lacy Aherne 1898\n76-86 by George Pepper\n\n\n=== Dyott Road ===\n30, 1910 for George Lanchester\n39, by William de Lacy Aherne 1902\n41, by William de Lacy Aherne 1900\n\n\n=== Grove Avenue ===\n17, Meldon by William de Lacy Aherne 1897\n\n\n=== Oxford Road ===\n90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 by William de Lacy Aherne 1905\n105, 107 by William de Lacy Aherne 1904\n110 and 112 by William de Lacy Aherne 1907\n113, 115, 117, 119 by William de Lacy Aherne  1907\n130, Maxstoke by Owen Parsons 1907\n\n\n=== St Agnes Road ===\n5, Hilver\n8, Harris House\n9, Whitecroft by William de Lacy Aherne 1906 for W.B.

        "content": "Pierros or Ilias Mavromichalis (1730 - 1800) he was a Greek soldier of the historical family of the Mavromichali.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in Mani and was the son of Georgakis Mavromichalis. He was named Pierros because of the maniatic (laconic) custom of naming those who exercise guardianship over their minor children on behalf of their brothers. He belonged to one of the most powerful families in Moria and had gained great power.\nIn order to occupy the Turks after the battles of Melipyrgos and Almyros, which had forced the Maniates to retreat and take refuge for the safety of their families in the inaccessible caves of Taygetos, he fortified himself with 36 men in a coastal tower of Verga, where he repelled two days the Turkish attacks. However, lacking water and munitions, he finally made a heroic exit with his men, with only his sword through the enemy.\nHowever, he and only one of his companions were saved from this operation. Arriving at the camp of the Maniats in Almyros, he announced the events and a general attack was decided against the army of Hatzi Osman. Indeed 4,000 Maniates descended from the mountain above Almyros, \"Selitsa\" and attempted a sudden night attack, pursuing the Turks as far as Kalamata. About 700 Turks were killed in this operation.\nPierros also took part in the Orlov revolt where he was killed, fighting the Albanians who had descended on the Peloponnese.\nHe was married with Katerina Koutsogrigorakou and his children were: Petrobey, Ioannis, Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos, Dimitrios and Antonios.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nΝεώτερον Εγκυκλοπαιδικόν Λεξικόν Ηλίου τ.13ος, σ.122.",

        "content": "Dilkhush Kumar, an Indian entrepreneur, is renowned as Bihar's startup king. He is the founder and CEO of RodBez, an app-based one way taxi service in Bihar, India. His entrepreneurial journey was highlighted on Shark Tank India Season 3, where he showcased his company and successfully negotiated a beneficial agreement with the sharks.\n\n\n== Early life and Career ==\nDilkhush Kumar hails from Bangaon, a small village in Saharsa District, Bihar. After completing his 12th board, he engaged in various odd jobs to sustain himself, from pulling rickshaws in Delhi to selling fruits and vegetables in Patna. His journey to becoming an entrepreneur was far from easy. Despite lacking a stellar educational background, Kumar managed to thrive, driven by his strong willpower and never-give-up attitude. Despite facing hardships, Kumar remained steadfast in his entrepreneurial spirit.\nHe initiated his entrepreneurial journey with 'Aarya Go Cab,' which gained traction in saharsa and other parts of Bihar. However, he soon envisioned the concept of establishing a database company, which led him to part ways with his first startup. He christened his second venture 'RodBez,' a distorted version of the term \"Roadways.\" The unique selling proposition of RodBez lies in its fare structure, where unlike Ola and Uber, which charge fares for round trips on outstation journeys, RodBez charges only for one-way trips.\nWithin a brief period of 6-7 months, Kumar successfully raised funds amounting to Rs 4 crore, attracting nearly 1.2 lakh visitors to the platform. RodBez offers services including one-way taxis, taxi pools, and carpooling, with customers paying higher rates for longer distances\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Loch Clair is a small remote shallow low-altitude freshwater loch, located within the Coulin Forest, some three miles to the south-west of Kinlochewe in Wester Ross. Loch Clair is the lower of two lochs in the same valley, and aligned on  a southeast–northwest bearing. The other loch is Loch Coulin that is fed by the River Coulin, the waters of which in turn flow out of Loch Coulin through a short unnamed river into Loch Clair. A small lochan, Loch Bharranch, is located a mile to the west and drains into the western end of Loch Clair through an unnamed burn.\nLoch Clair is drained by another river, A' Ghairbhe, which flows in a roughly north-east direction to Kinlochewe, where it joins the Abhainn Bruachaig to form the Kinlochewe River.\nLoch Clair can be reached by the A896 road, which runs from Kinlochewe to Torridon, Shieldaig and beyond.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLoch Clair is bounded to the north by a mountain massif in the Torridon area that contains the highest peak of Beinn Eighe, that is within Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve. The imposing peak of Liathach at 1024 metres is the most prominent peak that is visible from Loch Clair. To the west, the loch is bounded by a series of low hills, the highest two being Creag Dhubh at 384 metres and Sgùrr Dubh at 782 metres. To the east is open peatland in an area consisting of small hills, burns and peat bogs. To the south is a continuation of the mountainous Coulin Forest, with Meall an Leathaid Mhòir at altitude 512 metres.\n\n\n== Fishing ==\nLoch Clair is an excellent fishing location for trout that weigh 10 to 12 ounces. Ideal trout flies for the loch include Soldier Palmer, Greenwell's Glory and Silver Butcher.\n\n\n== Walking ==\nLoch Clair is the location of an almost level hiking route that follows the north coast of the loch, before making a circular walk around Loch Coulin and is about 9.64 km long.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Long Tall Sunshine is a live album by Barry Altschul's 3dom Factor, led by drummer Altschul, and featuring saxophonist Jon Irabagon and double bassist Joe Fonda. The trio's fourth release, it was recorded during a 2019 European tour, and was issued on CD in 2021 by Not Two Records.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn an article for The New York Times, Giovanni Russonello called Altschul's drumming \"a study in something more than contrast,\" and wrote: \"He knows how to skip across the surface of a beat while also giving it serious heft; his pocket is magnetic, but he'll just as soon dice it up or splatter it to bits.\" He described the title piece as \"brimming and charging but holding back too (thanks especially to Fonda's bass), with a harmonically rangy melody that sets up Irabagon for an uncorked solo.\"\nSelwyn Harris of Jazzwise suggested that listening to the album was like \"going back to when jazz was a voice for raw spontaneity and creative excess in the progressive tradition.\"\nJazz Journal's Peter Gamble noted that \"the trio display all the empathy we associate with longstanding collaborators,\" but commented: \"This is not music for a comfortable ride, even if the threesome do display an ability to swing in the conventional sense, for this is mainly improvised stuff on the outer edge.\"\nWriting for The New York City Jazz Record, George Kanzler singled out Irabagon's contribution, stating that he \"seems on a quest to expand his playing parameters.\" On tenor, he \"squawks, overblows and slap-tongues notes and sounds outside the normal range of the instrument,\" while on sopranino, he \"pushes the upper limits... amassing skeins of notes while circular breathing.\"\nIn an article for The Arts Fuse, Michael Ullman wrote: \"Altschul remains a master drummer and bandleader. Long Tall Sunshine pulls off a delightful paradox: it combines in-your-face vigor with subtlety, probing free improvisations with appealing compositions.\"\nMike Jurkovic of All About Jazz called the album \"as great an observation point as any to listen in as three guys tackle time and temper and come out victorious,\" while writer Karl Ackermann described it as \"a compellingly performed collection from a fine trio.\" AAJ's Dan McClenaghan noted the musicians' \"boisterous approach—tumultuous, rumbling muscularity from bassist Fonda and drummer Altschul, bellowing, screeching diatribes from saxophonist Irabagon.\" He commented: \"The group employs a bombastic simpatico that careens away from chaos toward a hell-bent forward momentum which has the feeling of a choreographed assault. A surrender to this... is recommended.\"\nScott Yanow of LA Jazz Scene stated: \"Altschul shows that he has not lost either his power or his creativity through the years... Open-eared listeners will find Long Tall Sunshine to be an invigorating listening experience.\"\nJazz Word's Ken Waxman remarked: \"Energy Music of the highest order, there's delicacy here as well as dissonance... As outside as they become with reed split tones, percussion splatters and weighty string slithering, a kernel of melody is referred to on and off. Fragmented quotes from disguised modern jazz classics lurk just below the surface and are heard in the saxophonist's theme statements and asides.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nComposed by Barry Altschul\n\n\"Long Tall Sunshine\" – 5:48\n\"The 3dom Factor\" – 13:55\n\"Irina\" – 4:00\n\"Be Out S'cool\" – 8:02\n\"Martin's Stew\" – 13:57\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBarry Altschul – drums\nJon Irabagon – tenor saxophone, sopranino saxophone, alto clarinet\nJoe Fonda – double bass\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Paul Delorme (July 26, 1868 in Saint-Maurice – December 7, 1956 in Paris) was a French physicist and chemist who became an industrialist after participating in the founding of the Air Liquide company in 1902, of which he was the first president, before passing the reins of the group to his son Jean Delorme, in 1945.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nPaul Delorme was the son of an industrialist who ran a lace factory. Paul attended ESPCI Paris, later becoming head of the sales department of the Thomson-Houston Electric Company when engineer Georges Claude, his classmate and friend, developed a process for liquefying air in order to separate its components. Delorme and Claude invested an initial sum of 7,500 francs, spent on the purchase of a compressed air engine, used for three years, in a small room in the La Villette depot that the Compagnie Générale des Omnibus had made available to them.\nIn 1902, Paul Delorme brought together 24 subscribers, mainly other engineers, to financially support the industrial project, in the form of a joint stock company, with capital of 100,000 francs. The first factory opened in France in 1905, followed by four others.\nFrom 1906, he led international expansion, in Belgium, Italy, Japan and Hong Kong, then in 1913 its IPO, among the coulissiers. In 1910, he sent René Jacques Lévy to Canada to create a factory on land in the eastern suburbs of Montreal, which was a great success, but the latter died in the sinking of the Titanic. In the 1920s, Air Liquide's development in China began in Shanghai. Between 1920 and 1929, Air Liquide raised 70 million francs through the issue of shares. Made up mainly of engineers and technicians, it is starting to have to count on the presence of small carriers, the majority of whom will remain relatively loyal to the company.\nIn 1930, the company's growth was successful with almost non-existent debt, the few issues of debt securities representing only 15% of the liabilities, in accordance with the financial doctrine of its president: \"I prefer, he said, to put all my eggs in a basket of which I hold the handle. Never in debt, in the short, medium or long term. Better to call on shareholder-partners than bankers. But it also does not give in to the fashion of subsidiaries, used in the 1920s for rapidly growing activities: The company must remain centralized, holding complete ownership of its materials and installations everywhere and at all times\". In reality, the international development strategy accommodates subsidiaries which are only fully integrated into the parent company once their activity has been consolidated, sparing Air Liquide in the event of the bankruptcy of one of them.\nFrom 1928, it was the 17th largest French market capitalization, after the rise of French industrial companies on the stock market, then the 6th in 1936. On the eve of World War II, the company already had nearly 130 factories in the world.\nHis son, Jean Delorme, took over in 1945, then stepped aside to his own son-in-law, Édouard de Royère, in 1985.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lucky Mohomi (born 10 May 1991) is a South African soccer player who last played as a midfielder for Richards Bay in the South African Premier Division.\nMohomi joined Mamelodi Sundowns from the Free State Stars in 2016. In his first season, Mamelodi Sundowns won the 2016 CAF Champions League. After 2017 and the arrival in the squad of Andile Jali, Mohomi fell out of favour and only played a cup game once in a while. He was also denied the chance to join another club on loan.\nAfter leaving for SuperSport United in 2020, Mohomi contended that he had \"wasted\" several years of his career, but at the same time \"I am where God wants me to be\". In 2021 Mohomi ended up in second-tier team Venda, which was a disappointment according to The Citizen's sources. He left Venda ahead of 2022, and was on trial with Marumo Gallants and Baroka during the winter 2022 transfer window.\nMohomi ended up signing for Marumo Gallants in 2022, participating in the 2022-23 CAF Confederation Cup whilst also facing relegation from the domestic league. After Marumo Gallants's relegation, Mohomi went on to Richards Bay.\n Towards the end of the 2024 winter transfer window, it was reported that Richards Bay released Mohomi and three others.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nassau Palace (Dutch: Hof van Nassau or French: Hôtel de Nassau was the former city palace of the House of Orange in Brussels. The palace was constructed in the 14th century and expanded in the following centuries. In the 18th century, it was acquired by Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, who replaced it with the Palace of Charles of Lorraine. Today, nothing remains except the chapel, which is part of the building of the Royal Library of Belgium (KBR)\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe palace was built in a strategic location on one of the higher parts of Brussels, not far from the residence of the Dukes of Brabant, the Coudenberg palace. Construction began in the 1340s by the wealthy nobleman Willem van Duvenvoorde when he settled in Brussels. Because Willem van Duvenvoorde left behind twelve illegitimate children but no legitimate heirs, his possessions, including his Brussels residence, passed into the possession of the Van Polanen family. It was then known as the inn of the Lek.\nThrough the marriage in 1403 of the last descendant of the Polanen family, Johanna van Polanen, to Engelbert I of Nassau, the palace came into the possession of the House of Nassau. The presence of the counts of Nassau in the vicinity of the Palace on the Coudenberg—the residence of the then rulers of the Burgundian Netherlands, the House of Valois-Burgundy —greatly contributed to the growth of their political influence in the 15th and 16th centuries. Between 1480 and 1520, the palace was extensively renovated by Engelbert II of Nassau and his successor Henry III of Nassau-Breda. Architects included Loys van Boghem, Laurens Keldermans, and Hendrik van Pede (1503).\n\n\n=== Henry III of Nassau-Breda ===\n\nUnder Henry III, the palace became a meeting place for the crowned heads of Europe, as well as for artists and writers. In 1517, the secretary of cardinal Luigi d'Aragona, the Italian Antonio de Beatis, described the palace. He not only described the numerous Trompe-l'œil doors but also a gigantic bed that Hendrik had made to throw drunken guests into during one of his many banquets. De Beatis also mentioned various paintings in the palace, such as the triptych \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\" by Hieronymus Bosch (in the Great Hall) and a \"Judgment of Paris\" with the three goddesses, presumably painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder.\nIn 1520, the palace was visited by the German painter Albrecht Dürer, who mentioned a \"well-painted\" work by Hugo van der Goes in the chapel (probably \"The Seven Sacraments,\" a lost altarpiece). Dürer also mentioned, like De Beatis, the large bed, which according to him accommodated 50 people, and he was shown the meteorite that supposedly fell next to Hendrik III in a field.\n\n\n=== William of Orange ===\nAfter Hendrik's death, the palace passed into the hands of René of Chalon and then to William of Orange, both princes of Orange. William lived in great splendour there. No less than 24 squires were at his disposal, and his court was considered the most prestigious gastronomic school in Europe. Due to the splendid feasts he held, his debt at one point amounted to 900,000 florins. The palace also contained an art gallery, which inventories from 1568 and 1618 provide insight into. The latter list mentions 56 paintings and tapestries.\nWillem supported the uprising against Spain in 1568 and saw his possessions confiscated. The Brussels palace was seized, and the newly arrived Duke of Alva took up residence there. Afterwards, the palace served as the residence of regent Peter Ernst I of Mansfeld (1517–1604).\nIn 1601, the measure was lifted in favour of Orange's eldest son, Philip William, Prince of Orange (1554–1618), who had become a steadfast Catholic in Spain and was allowed to reclaim the ancestral home upon his return to Brussels.\n\n\n=== 17th century ===\n\nFrom this time comes a testimony from the French traveler Pierre Bergeron. He was in Brussels in 1612 and remembered, in his unpublished manuscript \"Itinéraire germano-belgique,\" especially the ubiquitous slogans in the palace: the proud \"Ce sera moy Nassau\" and the actual motto, a sailing ship with \"Tardando progredior\" (I advance by delaying).\nWhen Philipp William passed away, the palace was awarded to John VIII, Count of Nassau-Siegen (1583–1638), who once considered by the Habsburg governors as the head of the House of Nassau. He was a successful army commander and married princess Ernestine Yolande de Ligne (1594–1668). He also constructed the Castle of Ronse as a new ancestral castle of the Catholic branch of the Nassau family in the Southern Netherlands.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\nAt the start of the 18th century, the palace served as the residence of governor marquess Isidoro de la Cueva y Benavides (1652–1723), the commander of the Spanish troops. During his stay, a fire broke out, but the firefighters were quickly on the scene and were able to extinguish the flames with their recently invented fire engine before much damage was done (1701).\nIn 1731, the nearby Palace on the Coudenberg was destroyed by fire, and the court moved to the Nassau palace, which henceforth became known as the New Court. Around 1750, Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine began negotiations to purchase the Nassau palace. The palace was dilapidated and no longer adapted to the tastes of the time. It was sold for a small sum and almost completely demolished (except for the chapel) to make way for a neoclassical residence for the governors-general of the Austrian Netherlands (see Palace of Charles of Lorraine).\nBy 1797, the old garden of the palace had become a renowned botanical garden, first part of the Central School of Brussels and from 1822 operated by the Society of Flora. It had to make way for the Palais de l'Industrie nationale in 1825 after a few decades.\n\n\n== What remains ==\n\nThe Nassau Chapel, dedicated to Saint George in Brabantine Gothic style, is the only part of the palace that remains. It is a 15th-century Gothic structure that likely stands on the site of the original chapel from 1344. A bas-relief by Georges Dobbels depicting the former appearance of the palace is located on the facade (1969).\nIn the 19th century, the chapel served successively as:\n\nA beer warehouse;\nA storage place for the sculptures of Mathieu Kessels;\nA laboratory for the Royal Museum of Natural Sciences (the Bernissart Iguanodons were displayed there);\nA catalogue room for the International Institute for Bibliography of Paul Otlet;\nA reading room for the General State Archives.\nIn 1956, the chapel was enclosed within the modern buildings of the Albertina on the Kunstberg, after relocation was first considered. The space is used for exhibitions.\nThe place of the former garden is now the Museumplein.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDumon, Pierre (1970). \"La chapelle de Nassau\".

        "content": "Black Dog In My Path is the second album by American musician Yowler. It was released on 12 October 2018 on record label Double Double Whammy.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nYowler is the stage name of musician Maryn Jones.\nJones is lead singer and songwriter of All Dogs, was a bassist and vocalist for Saintseneca, and self-released two solo albums under their own name in 2008 and 2012. In 2015 Jones released The Offer, their debut album as Yowler. Shortly afterwards they moved from Columbus, Ohio to Philadelphia.\nBlack Dog In My Path was recorded in Philadelphia, with contributions from Jones' friends and label-/bandmates Kyle Gilbride (Swearin'), Matt O'Conke (Saintseneca), Catherine Elicson (All Dogs, Empath), and Michael Cantor (The Goodbye Party). The album was released by Double Double Whammy on 12 October 2018;\nthe tracks \"WTFK\" and \"Angel\" were released as singles.\nThe tracks \"Holy Fire\" and \"No\" were written around the same time as Yowler's debut, and \"(Holidays Reprise)\" is a direct reference to a track from that album. Jones spent two years writing the rest of the album.\nThe title of the album refers to the folkloric black dog Moddey Dhoo, which Jones came across while reading about their Manx ancestry, and which they described as \"a warning and a protection to not go where you shouldn't go, don't go to the sad dark place.\"\n\n\n== Themes ==\nJones was raised a mormon, and their decision to leave the church is explored in the lyrics of some tracks, and through their use of religious imagery.\nThe opening line of single \"Angel\" is a variation of the first line of the hymn Amazing Grace, and Jones told Stereogum that the song is \"a celebration of coming to personal realizations and having experiences with people that informed those realizations\", and that they intentionally chose it to open the album because it is joyful.\nMental health is also a theme of the album. Jones told Vice that \"a lot of the songs on the record are about really hard things, whether it's easy to tell or not.\" They described the song \"Where Is My Light\" as being about \"going through a period of pretty intense isolation and regret and feeling really hurt by people.\" Jones also described the dynamics of the album, from love song \"Petals\" to darker \"WTFK\" (which Pitchfork said \"evokes early Black Sabbath\"), as being \"reminiscent of the human experience...especially when you're dealing with distress and mental illness.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nSasha Geffen of Pitchfork rated the album 7.6/10, and described single \"Angel\" as an \"elegant little folk-rock track that unfurls like a poem.\" Magnet called the album \"a must hear.\"\nCailtin White of Uproxx wrote that compared to their debut, \"the sonic textures of Black Dog In My Path are far more expansive.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Maryn Jones.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMaryn Jones – guitar, bass, casio, vocals\nKyle Gilbride – guitar, bass, synth, keyboard, percussion, vocals\nMatt O'Conke – drums on tracks 1, 2 and 4\nCatherine Elicson – clarinet on tracks 8 and 9, bass on tracks 1 and 11\nMichael Cantor – bowed guitar on track 9, vocals on tracks 1 and 3, cello on track 2\nTechnical\n\nMaryn Jones, Kyle Gilbride – production\nJosh Bonati – mastering\nChelsea Dirck – photography\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Red Max is an action game developed by David Darling and published by Codemasters in 1987. It was released for the Atari 8-bit family and the Commodore 64. This game closely resembles Darling's earlier work, The Last V8. The graphics were created by James Wilson, with music composed by David Whittaker.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a dystopian future where the Sun has unexpectedly begun a supernova cycle, the remnants of humanity, surviving a global war, face an urgent need to escape Earth. They colonize the moon and engineer massive anti-gravity orbs to alter its orbit toward the Sun. As the moon approaches the Sun, the orbs are used to propel it through the solar system, aiming to enter a new solar system to sustain human life.\nThe colonists' strategy includes entering hibernation for twelve hundred years, hoping to outlast the Sun's supernova event. When they believe they are safely past the Sun, an unforeseen threat arises. The Renegade Death Lords, a group of saboteurs, land on the moon and disrupt the colony's power plants by planting fission mines. The player must swiftly deactivate these mines and awaken the crew from hibernation before the power outage leads to their permanent demise.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nThe gameplay interface is divided into two primary sections. The top portion of the screen serves as the main play area, while the bottom section includes critical game information displays: a speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, and shield status indicator. The player can collect fuel during gameplay; however, shields are not replenishable and will diminish upon collision with obstacles. Losing all fuel or shields results in the loss of a life.\nThe main view is from above, centering the Red Max bike in the midst of the landscape, which scrolls as the bike moves. Acceleration is controlled by pressing the fire button, and releasing it engages the brakes. The bike can also be steered left or right. The objective is to navigate the lunar surface, deactivating flashing mines by driving over them. Successfully clearing the mines triggers an alarm, signaling the player to proceed to a lift that descends to the engineering level.\nThe mines are strategically placed in challenging locations, guarded by the Moon's automatic defense mechanisms. These defenses include laser fences that can be temporarily disabled by running over specific switches, persistent laser gates that cannot be turned off, and patches of slime that compromise steering and damage the bike's tires. These hazards gradually deplete the bike’s shields. Additionally, collisions with walls and buildings can result in total destruction of the bike.\nSubsequent levels follow a similar gameplay structure but introduce more complex labyrinths of buildings and walls, increasing the difficulty of maneuvering the bike through the environment.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRed Max was met with mostly positive reviews. A critic from Your Commodore magazine praised the game, highlighting its replay value by stating: \"Red Max is yet another highly addictive budget game that drives you back for another game again, and again.\" Meanwhile, a reviewer from Atari User magazine also responded favorably, despite some reservations about the motorcycle console occupying the bottom two-thirds of the screen, which they felt contributed little to gameplay. Nevertheless, the reviewer concluded positively, noting, \"Red Max is one of the best budget games I've seen,\" and awarded it an impressive score of 9 out of 10.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRed Max at MobyGames\nRed Max at Lemon 64",

        "content": "The Masonic Temple is a historic clubhouse in Lagro, Indiana completed in 1913. The National Register of Historic Places listed the masonic temple in 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn May 26, 1853, the Free and Accepted Masons chartered the Tuscan Lodge No. 143.  In 1913, the group built a dedicated meeting space that would also provide rental income from retail businesses: the Citizens State Bank and the Lagro Hardware Company. Eventually, the hardware store closed in 1970 and the lodge disbanded in 1996. \nBeginning in 2017, the volunteer-based Lagro Canal Foundation gradually rehabbed the building by recovering the roof, fixing the drainage, repointing the facade, and replacing exterior lighting. The group plans for historic preservation to encourage economic redevelopment.  In 2021, the Wabash River Trail built a pavilion, firepit, and restrooms across from the building.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe 1913 building reflects both early commercial and classical revival architectural styles. The two-story structure consists of a street-level storefront: the former bank on the left and the hardware store on the right. The second level contains a one-bedroom apartment and meeting room for the lodge. The building shares a common wall with the Red Men Hall, forming a commercial block.\nThe brick facade has a cornice with dentil detailing along the roof. Each window is framed with limestone lintels and windowsills. An inlaid panel includes the Masonic square and compasses symbol. The former bank side has limestone Tuscan order pillars rising to a bulkhead with carved letters reading \"19 Citizens State Bank 13\". In contrast, the former hardware storefront is relatively simple.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Masonic buildings in Indiana\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Wabash County, Indiana\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIndiana Freemasons\nLagro Canal Foundation\nCitizens State Bank\nWabash River Trail",

The National Register of Historic Places listed the building in 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Improved Order of Red Men is a fraternal organization that established a Lagro chapter or \"wigwam\" in 1888 and named it after the Tonkawa people. The group's rituals are based on perceived Native American customs.\nAs of 1904, the local had 41 members and, by 1911, was large enough to fund construction of a new building.\n However, by 1948, the declining lodge surrendered its charter. \nBeginning in 2017, the volunteer-based Lagro Canal Foundation has gradually rehabbed the building by replacing the roof, restoring the facade, and removing debris from the interior.

When the front facade was repointed in 2020, the locally sourced bricks were found to be a non-standard size, so replacements bricks were repurposed from the hidden side wall.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRed Men Hall (Reading, Pennsylvania)\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Wabash County, Indiana\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIndiana Redmen\nLagro Canal Foundation",

It was extended on 12 November 1987 and 14 March 2005 and now comprises an area covering 95.06 hectares (234.9 acres).\nThe opening of Moseley railway station in 1867 started a property boom in Moseley, which was accelerated by the arrival of steam driven tramway services to Birmingham provided by the Birmingham Central Tramways Company Ltd which started operating on 29 December 1884. Moseley was an attractive location for the prosperous middle-classes, as it was situated south of Birmingham upwind of the industrial smoke of the city. The conservation area comprises a number of streets developed from the 1860s to the 1930s with a wide variety of architectural styles ranging from Victoria and Edwardian villas, and Arts and Crafts houses built by local architects such as William de Lacy Aherne and Owen Parsons.\n\n\n== Notable buildings and structures ==\n\n\n=== Alcester Road ===\n\n\n=== Amesbury Road ===\n\n\n=== Chantry Road ===\n\n\n=== Goodby Road ===\nIdeal Society Benefit flats 1936 by Richard O Warder\n\n\n=== Moor Green Lane ===\n\n\n=== Park Hill ===\n\n\n=== Reddings Road ===\nReddings Road was cut in 1903 and developed in two phases.

The album was a commercial failure, due to the mediocrity of some of the songs, as well as Jerry Wexler's departure from Atlantic Records.\nIt was Tate's last album until 2003; his close friends and associates were often unsure of his whereabouts during the intervening decades.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by Jerry Ragovoy, who also wrote or cowrote the majority of the songs. The producer later regretted the song selection, conceding that some were too pop. \"Jemima Surrender\" is a cover of the song by the Band.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nRobert Christgau praised \"Tate's amazing vocal and emotional range—as cocksure as Wilson Pickett one moment, as sweet and hurting as B.B. King the next, and as corny as Joe Tex to top it off.\" The Buffalo Evening News noted \"Tate's mellow elastic voice and some neatly turned tunes.\" The Courier News opined that \"the soulful Ragovoy pieces are made to order for the warm, understanding feeling that Tate unleashes.\" The Boston Globe considered Howard Tate to be one of the best R&B albums of 1972.\nAllMusic wrote that \"the arrangements are staid period soul, and while the musicians back Tate with confidence and energy, it's difficult for them to open up within such constrained charts.\" In 2018, The Independent listed \"Girl of the North Country\" as the sixth best Bob Dylan cover song, writing that, \"given the full Atlantic Records treatment with booming horns and Tate's soaring voice, it shouldn't really work but the resulting celebratory air is a perfect counterpoint to the sombre and regretful mood of the original.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hong I-chung (May 14, 1961 -), nicknamed \"Hongzhong\", is a Taiwanese baseball catcher. He once played for the Brother Elephants of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) and Gao Ping Fala of the Taiwan Major League. He has previously served as the manager of the La New Bears, Lamigo Monkeys, and Fubon Guardians, and became the manager of the TSG Hawks on January 16, 2023.\n\n\n== Youth Era ==\nHong I-chung first played baseball when he was in elementary school, and later joined the famous Meiho Senior High School Baseball Team. He represented Taiwan in the 16th World Youth Baseball Championship in 1976 and 1979 respectively.\n\n\n== Playing Career ==\nBefore the establishment of the Chinese Professional Baseball League, Hong joined the Brother Elephants baseball team and stayed with the Elephants for a total of eleven years. During these eleven years, he won the Taiwan Series MVP, the Best Nine Award, a Gold Glove, and more. However, after moving to Gao Ping Fala of the Taiwan Major League, Hong was regarded as a traitor by the Chinese Professional Baseball League. After the merge of the two leagues, he did not return to the Chinese Professional Baseball League until 2004 when he became pitching coach for the La New Bears.\n\n\n== Managing Era ==\nIn 2004, he became the pitching coach of the La New Bears and became the head coach in the same year after Takuji Ohta resigned from his job. Hong led La New to two consecutive championships in 2006-2007, both beating the Lions. In 2009, due to some La New players being involved in a match fixing incident and poor performance in leading the team, Hong was sent down to manage the minor league team of the Bears, swapping with Tsai Rongzong who was in that position at the time. In 2010, he returned as the manager for the Bears after Tsai resigned from his job. After the Bears rebranded into the Lamigo Monkeys in 2011, in 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017, Hong successfully won the Taiwan Series. The five championships Hong won officially surpassed the record of four championships won by former Lions head coach Lu Wensheng. On July 11, 2017, he led the Lamigo Monkeys to defeat the Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions 4-2, becoming the manager with the most wins in the history of the CPBL, and the manager with the most wins coaching a single team. Hong then won the Taiwan Series in 2018 and 2019 to give Lamigo their three-peat, leading the team to establish the \"Lamigo Dynasty\". Hong switched teams in 2020 and managed the Fubon Guardians for 2 years. In 2023, Hong signed a 3-year contract with the TSG Hawks, becoming their first manager.\n\n\n== References ==",

As of 2024, 186,787 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 2008 from the Gwangsan constituency.\n\n\n== History ==\nGwangsan B, like all other constituencies located in Gwangju and the Honam region, is considered as a stronghold for the liberal Democratic Party. The constituency has voted for candidates of the Democratic Party and its predecessor parties in every election except for in 2016.\nLee Yong-seop of the United Democratic Party was the first member to represent the constituency winning in a landslide with 73.16% of the vote. Lee won-re-election in 2012 with 74.67% of the vote against Hwang Cha-eun of the Unified Progressive Party. However, Lee resigned from the National Assembly on May 7, 2014, in order to run as an independent candidate for Mayor of Gwangju in the upcoming local elections. Kwon Eun-hee of the centrist-liberal New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD) won the by-election for the constituency, securing 60.6% of the vote. In the aftermath of the NPAD party split, incumbent Kwon Eun-hee along with other influential Honam politicians joined the People Party led by Ahn Cheol-soo. Despite Gwangsan B and the region's historical preference for candidates of the Democratic Party, Kwon won re-election as a member of the People Party in the 2016 election. Kwon did not stand for re-election in the 2020 election. She was succeeded by Min Hyung-bae of the Democratic Party who won in a landslide with 84.05% of the vote. Min won re-election in 2024 against former Prime Minister of South Korea Lee Nak-yon of the New Future Party.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Cheomdan 1-dong, Cheomdan 2-dong, Bia-dong, Singa-dong, Sinchang-dong, Suwan-dong, Hanam-dong, and Imgok-dong.\n\n\n== List of members of the National Assembly ==\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2014 by-election ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mahabharata, Harivamsa and other Hindu scriptures or Krishna Charitas agree that the birth of Krishna took place in Mathura, present—day Uttar Pradesh, on eighth day of Krishna Paksha of Bhadrapada month of Hindu calendar to Vasudeva Anakdundubhi and his wife Devaki. According to popular Hindu beliefs, Krishna was the eighth of ten Avatar of Vishnu, born in the Dvapara Yug, the third age of present Hindu cosmology. Krishna is many times revered as a supreme soul, and ultimate truth in many Hindu traditions, such as in, Krishnaism and Vaishnavism.\n\nThough, Krishna's original birth date is heavily disputed, many scholars believes that Krishna was probably born around 3rd millennium BCE or even earlier. Born in Mathura, in the prison of his maternal uncle Kamsa, Krishna was taken to Nanda, by his father in Brij, through river Yamuna, on the night of his birth. Krishna was born with divinity, as he is regarded as the incarnation of Vishnu, among Hindu traditions and beliefs.\nKrishna's birth is celebrated on the eighth night of Bhadrapada month, every year as Krishna Janmashtami.\n\n\n== Dating ==\n\nDating the birth of Krishna is a complex matter due to differing interpretations and historical accounts. According to Hindu tradition, Krishna was born on the eighth day  (Ashtami) of the Krishna Paksha (dark fortnight) in the month of Bhadrapada               (August-September) of the Hindu lunar calendar. However, scholars and historians have proposed various dates based on astronomical calculations, historical references, and archaeological evidence.\nOne commonly cited astronomical calculation places Krishna's birth around 3228 BCE, as mentioned in the Surya Siddhanta, an ancient Hindu astronomical text. This calculation is based on the position of stars and planetary positions described in the text.\nAnother approach relies on historical references found in ancient texts such as the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata Purana. These texts provide genealogies, descriptions of celestial events, and references to historical figures that can be used to establish a timeline. Based on these references, some scholars suggest dates ranging from 3102 BCE to 3067 BCE for Krishna's birth.\nArchaeological evidence has also been considered in dating Krishna's birth. Excavations and studies of ancient sites such as Dwarka, associated with Krishna's kingdom, provide insights into the historical context of the Mahabharata period. However, correlating archaeological findings with specific events mentioned in the texts remains a subject of debate among scholars.\n\n\n== Legends ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nThe background of Krishna's birth is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology and scripture, particularly in the epic texts of the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata Purana. According to these texts, Krishna is considered to be the eighth avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu, who is revered as the preserver in Hinduism.The circumstances surrounding Krishna's birth are intricate and multifaceted. He was born in the Yadava clan, a prominent dynasty in ancient India, specifically in the city of Mathura. His parents were Vasudeva and Devaki, who were members of the Yadava royal family. Devaki's brother, Kamsa, was a tyrant king who had usurped the throne by overthrowing his father, Ugrasena.\nKamsa, wants his sister to marry Vasudeva, an old friend of him, and prepared their marriage. However, a prophecy occurred during marriage, that Devaki and Vasudev's eighth son would be the reason for Kamsa's death. A furious Kamsa, imprisoned his sister and her husband due to a prophecy that predicted he would be killed by Devaki's eighth child.To prevent the prophecy from coming true, Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and Vasudeva and killed their first six children as soon as they were born.\n\n\n=== Krishna's divine birth ===\n\nAfter killing Devaki's six sons, Kamsa becomes more cautious. Devaki secretly transfers her seventh son to Vasudeva's first wife Rohini's womb, who born as Balrama. As Devaki gave birth to Krishna, the prison where they were held became filled with celestial light, and the guards fell into a deep sleep. Simultaneously, the chains binding Vasudeva loosened, and the prison doors swung open miraculously. Understanding the gravity of the situation, Vasudeva carried the newborn Krishna across the raging Yamuna River to safety in the nearby village of Gokul.\n\nUpon reaching Gokul, Vasudeva exchanged Krishna with a baby girl born to Yashoda and Nanda, a cowherd couple, to protect Krishna from Kamsa's wrath. This act of divine subterfuge, known as the Yamuna crossing or Vasudeva crossing, is a poignant symbol of Krishna's transcendence and the interplay between divinity and humanity. Vasudeva took the girl back to Kamsa's prison, who was actually a Maya.  \n\nWhen Vasudev returned to prison of Kamsa, everything becomes as it was. Kamsa got the news of Devaki's eighth child's birth, but was shocked to see a girl instead of a son, as prophesied.  Nevertheless, kamsa killed the girl child, but the child soon, comes into her true form and prophesied \"the one who has to kill you, has already taken birth.\"\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nAfter the prophecy, a scared Kamsa tried many times to kill the baby Krishna, such as by sending Putana. However, he failed at his every attempt to kill Krishna, as Krishna slayed every demon. Krishna was raised in Gokul, at the household of Nanda, and during childhood was a naughty and playful child. During childhood, he was migrated several times and protected villagers from the tyranny of Kamsa. He then slayed Kamsa, at the age of eleven.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWhen discussing the sources of Krishna's birth, it's essential to draw from a variety of ancient Hindu texts and scriptures that form the basis of the narrative. These sources provide differing perspectives and interpretations of Krishna's birth, enriching our understanding of this pivotal event in Hindu mythology.\nBhagavata Purana is one of the most significant sources for the story of Krishna's birth. It narrates the divine pastimes of Krishna, including his birth, childhood, and exploits as a divine avatar. The Bhagavata Purana offers intricate details and descriptions of the celestial events surrounding Krishna's birth, as well as his upbringing in Gokul. Another ancient epic, the Mahabharata, contains references to Krishna's birth and his role in the larger narrative of the Mahabharata war. While the Mahabharata focuses more on the political and social aspects of Krishna's life, it still provides valuable insights into the circumstances leading to his birth.Vishnu Purana, dedicated to the deity Vishnu, contains sections related to Krishna's birth and his significance as an avatar of Vishnu. It elucidates the theological aspects of Krishna's birth and his divine nature.\nHarivamsa, often considered an appendix to the Mahabharata, the Harivamsa elaborates on the early life and genealogy of Krishna. It provides additional details about Krishna's birth and upbringing, expanding upon the narratives found in other texts. While primarily known for its philosophical teachings, the Bhagavad Gita, a section of the Mahabharata, also contains references to Krishna's divine nature and his role as an avatar. These references contribute to the overall understanding of Krishna's significance in Hindu theology.\nAdditionally, Various commentaries by scholars and saints throughout history offer insights and interpretations of Krishna's birth based on these ancient texts. These commentaries provide valuable perspectives and help contextualize the significance of Krishna's birth within the broader Hindu tradition.\n\n\n== Celebration ==\n\n\n=== India ===\n\nKrishna Janmashtami is a joyous and widely celebrated festival in India, commemorating the birth of Krishna. The festival typically falls in the month of August or September, on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the Krishna Paksha (dark fortnight) in the Hindu lunar calendar.\nThroughout India, devotees observe Krishna Janmashtami with great fervor and enthusiasm. Preparations for the festival often begin weeks in advance, with temples and homes adorned with colorful decorations, lights, and floral arrangements. The celebration typically involves special prayers, devotional songs, and recitations from sacred texts, particularly the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata Purana, which recount the divine pastimes of Krishna. Many temples organize elaborate ceremonies, including the Abhishekam (ritual bathing) of infant Krishna idols, followed by the offering of various sweets, fruits, and delicacies as prasad (sanctified food).\nOne of the highlights of Krishna Janmashtami is the midnight celebration, marking the exact moment of Krishna's birth. Devotees gather in temples and homes to sing devotional songs (bhajans) and perform traditional dances, such as the Raslila, which depicts Krishna's divine play and exploits with his beloved devotees, especially the Gopis (cowherd maidens). Another popular custom during Krishna Janmashtami is the Dahi Handi (or Matki Phod) festival, particularly in Maharashtra and parts of North India. In this tradition, young men form human pyramids to reach and break clay pots filled with buttermilk, symbolizing Krishna's love for butter as a child.\nKrishna Janmashtami transcends regional and cultural boundaries, uniting devotees from diverse backgrounds in celebration and devotion. It is a time of joy, reflection, and spiritual renewal, as people revere Krishna as the embodiment of divine love, wisdom, and compassion.\n\n\n=== Outside India ===\nKrishna Janmashtami is celebrated not only in India but also in various countries around the world, wherever there are significant Hindu communities. In countries such as Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Fiji, Mauritius, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and many others, devotees observe Krishna Janmashtami with great enthusiasm and devotion. In these countries, temples dedicated to Krishna organize special events and ceremonies to mark the occasion. Devotees gather to sing devotional songs, participate in prayers and rituals, and listen to discourses on the life and teachings of Lord Krishna. The festivities often include cultural performances, such as dance dramas depicting Krishna's childhood exploits and divine pastimes.\nIn addition to temple celebrations, Hindu communities organize private gatherings in homes and community centers, where families and friends come together to observe Krishna Janmashtami with puja (worship), bhajans (devotional songs), and feasting on special delicacies prepared for the occasion. While the customs and traditions may vary slightly from one country to another, the essence of Krishna Janmashtami remains the same — a time for devotees to express their love and devotion to Lord Krishna, celebrate his divine birth, and seek his blessings for peace, prosperity, and spiritual enlightenment.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKrishna\nBala Krishna\nVasudeva\nBhagvad Gita\nHarivamsa\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Azerbaijani calendar beliefs are common beliefs about the naming of different times (cosmic periods, years, months, etc.) in Azerbaijani culture.\nHistorically, the Turkish calendar with twelve animals and the Jalali calendar were used in the cultural environment of Azerbaijan. The Twelve Animal calendars have been used in the region since the Mongol period, and the Jalali calendar has been used since the 18th century at the latest. During the Safavid period, the twelve animal calendar was used as the official calendar. During this period, the Malik-ush-shuara (chief of poets) at the court recited poems in the Azerbaijani language about the transition from the old year to the new one. The calendar with twelve animals remained in use in Iran until 1925, until the fall of the Qajars.\nThe formation of the Azerbaijani folk calendar is based on the attitude to nature, the movement of celestial bodies, and agricultural traditions. The transition from winter to spring occurs when the world sleeps, and is celebrated with Novruz holiday. Although Nowruz and Khidir Nabi holidays are celebrated together in different regions of Azerbaijan, the good celebration of one of the holidays is observed with the poor celebration of the other. Chilla night is celebrated on the occasion of the beginning of winter, Sadda holiday is celebrated on the occasion of the transition from Big Chilla to Little Chilla.\nDue to the influence of Islam, Turkish-origin week names in Azerbaijan were replaced by Arabic-Persian names or used together with them. In the dialects of the Azerbaijani language, weekdays are referred to as salt, grief, honey, milk days, etc. On the day of ancestors, known as the Name Day, the deceased are remembered, and as a remnant of Shamanism, porridge is consumed.\n\n\n== Cosmic cycles ==\nIvar Lassi, who studied the traditions of Muharram in Azerbaijan, reported that Azerbaijanis believe in the existence of 10 cosmic cycles, each lasting 10,000 years. These cosmic cycles are divided into 12-year solar years. Azerbaijanis believed that the 5th cycle continued into the 1910s.\n\n\n== History of calendars in Azerbaijan ==\n\n\n=== Jalali calendar ===\nThe Jalali calendar has been used by Azerbaijanis since the 18th century at the latest. In this calendar created during the reign of the Seljuk ruler Malikshah I, the year begins a month and a half after the Chinese-Uyghur calendar, at the spring equinox (Nowruz), but the 12-animal calendar has been assimilated into the calendar.  The absence of an exact date of Khizir Nabi holiday, but the celebration of Novruz holiday on a specific day, is explained by the fact that Novruz holiday Novruz was officially incorporated into the Jalali calendar in the 11th century.\n\n\n=== The Twelve Animal Calendar ===\n\nThe Great Mongol Empire, which includes modern Azerbaijan, the Uyghur version of the Chinese calendar was applied throughout the occupied territories. During the lkhanate period, all Turkmen Oghuz clans of Azerbaijan and Eastern Anatolia used Turkish year and month names. The use of the Twelve Animal Calendar was related to the influence of Eastern Turkic languages, and the Mongols implemented the Uyghur version of the calendar. Although Mongol translations were used, Turkic designations retained their significance. In Fazlullah Rashiduddin's historical work, year names are used 26 times in Turkish, 13 times in Mongolian, 13 times in both languages, and 2 times in Persian. However, month names were only in Turkic.\nGeorgian sources show more of an Eastern (Uyghur-Chagatai) character, and it is possible to encounter the Twelve Animal Calendar dating back to the Mongol period. The term \"Siçan ili\" used is of Oghuz origin (the word \"il\" is more precisely of Azerbaijani origin). Certainly, these Oghuz elements should be attributed to local Eastern Ottoman-Azerbaijani influences. In the same way, the word \"ilan\" used for the year is either of Azerbaijani or Turkish origin.\nThe apparently multicultural character of the Safavid empire (the Twelver Imam Shiism, the use of Persian and Azerbaijani languages, the administration being of Arabic and Turko-Mongol origin) is most often confirmed when historians use different chronology methods (Hijri, Shah's regnal years, Turko-Mongol calendar). During the Safavid period, the Turkish calendar was used as the official calendar, and in Safavid historiography, this calendar was spread under the influence of Teymuri (Chagatay) historiography. The fact that Nowruz holiday is considered the beginning of this calendar is noted by Safavi historian Iskandar Bey Munshi: \"With the arrival of Nowruz, the Year of the Snake of the Turkish Calendar began luckily and happily\". During this period, the Malik-ush-shuara (chief of poets) at the court recited poems in the Azerbaijani language about the transition from the old year to the new one.\nThe Turkish calendar was used in Iran until the fall of the Qajar dynasty in 1925. According to Turkish historian Osman Turan, the calendar with twelve animals still exists in Azerbaijan. In general, the Turkish calendar played an important role in the lives of all Turkic peoples of the Caucasus and was passed on to other peoples in the neighborhood.\nThe commonly used names are as follows: mouse, ox-cow, tiger, rabbit, dragon (or crocodile and fish), snake, horse, sheep (or goat), monkey, chicken-rooster (or simply bird), dog, pig. Such naming of years is considered \"Tarikh-i Turki\".\nIn Azerbaijani folklore, beliefs related to the Turkic calendar are encountered. According to a widespread belief among the people, the nature of the upcoming year, whether it will be good or bad, is associated with the character and traits of the animal named after it. For example, when the year of the snake arrives, they say that the weather will be warm, drought will pass, and relations will not be normal. In the year of the rabbit, the harvest is plentiful, in the year of the dragon (crocodile), there is a lot of rain, in the year of the pig, the weather will be harsh, etc.\nAccording to another calendar myth, fortune tellers who gathered in one place on Novruz gave names to the years, and if the year is based on an animal, people will show the character of that animal. For example, people gnaw and destroy in the year of the mouse, be tolerant in the year of the horse, and fight in the year of the dog. Another myth tells the story that because people confused the years, their rulers named the years after the animals that appeared in front of them.\n\n\n=== Turkish calendar ===\nIn the theoretically existing Turkish calendar (based on lunar years), the 1st month is called Aram, and the last month is called Haqqsabat. The remaining months are named by numbers. An intercalary month is added after the 2nd or 3rd year. This month is called Sivan, which means \"crying\".\n\n\n== Azerbaijan folk calendar ==\nIn the Azerbaijani folk calendar, different times (months, periods, holidays or ceremonies) are marked with special names. The formation of the folk calendar in Azerbaijan is rooted in the attitude to nature, celestial movements and agricultural traditions. In the folk calendar, terms such as the month of plowing, the month of migration, the month of vay nene, the month of irrigation, and the month of harvest are used.\nAccording to legend, in ancient times, when the year was divided into months, each month was given 32 days, except for the \"Boz\" month, which had 14 days. E very month gives 1 day to the Boz month  so that the Boz month does not get hurt. Some months give him days again because the Boz month is still short. However, since the Boz month takes days from other months, its days are not similar in terms of weather conditions.\nHistorically, in places where Nowruz holiday is celebrated with great enthusiasm in Azerbaijan, Khidir Nabi holiday has either not been celebrated or has been poorly celebrated. At the same time, where Khidir Nabi holiday is well celebrated, Nowruz holiday has not been celebrated in an important way.

In Islam, Friday is a day of communal worship in Islam. It is believed that sins are forgiven for those who listen to the sermon and perform prayers in the mosque on that day. In Azerbaijani religious tales, Friday is described as a holy day. Fairies come to bathe in the lake on Fridays.

        "content": "The Heavy Is the Head Tour was the second concert tour by British rapper Stormzy, staged in support of his second studio album, Heavy Is the Head (2019). The tour began on 7 February 2020 at the RedfestDXB festival in Dubai, and was scheduled to conclude on 10 October of the same year in Lagos, Nigeria. The tour was officially announced in November 2019, with additional dates published on 6 December 2019. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was suspended at the start of March 2020 and resumed with 15 dates in the UK and Ireland in March and April of 2022.\n\n\n== Tour ==\nThe tour kicked off on 7 February 2020 at the RedfestDXB festival in Dubai, before heading to Europe as part of the tour's first leg. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic caused numerous disruptions to the tour. On 13 February 2020 the Asian leg of the tour was postponed. Although the European dates were generally kept, the final concert of the European leg, scheduled for Zurich in Switzerland on 5 March, was cancelled after authorities limited gatherings to a maximum of 1,000 people. Stormzy performed in Prague on 4 March to a sold-out crowd at the Malá sportovní hala in Výstaviště Praha, but this proved to be his last public concert of 2020.\nThe Australia and New Zealand leg of the tour were later postponed for the same reason, firstly to November 2020, before being rescheduled for November and December 2022. In September 2022, the Australasian dates were cancelled outright.\nThe UK & Ireland leg of the tour was pushed back from its initial slot of September 2020, to April 2021, before being moved again to March 2022. The tour finally resumed with Stormzy's first UK arena date in Cardiff on 13 March 2022.\n\n\n== Set list ==\nThe following set list was obtained from the concert held on 15 March 2022 at the Utilita Arena in Newcastle, England. It does not represent all concerts for the duration of the tour. \n\nIntro\nBig Michael\nAudacity\nKnow Me From\nCold\nHandsome\nFirst Things First\nInterlude - Heavy Is The Head\nCrown\nSuperheroes\nOwn It\nDo Better\nReal Life (Burna Boy ft.

        "content": "The Alpine A524 is a Formula One racing car designed and developed by the Alpine F1 Team competing in the 2024 Formula One World Championship. It is the fourth Formula One car entered by Alpine since rebranding from Renault. The A524 is  being driven by Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly. Reserve driver duties are handled by Formula 2 driver and Alpine junior Jack Doohan. It is widely considered to be a step down from its predecessor, and one of the least competitive cars on track.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlpine unveiled the car at a launch event at their factory at Enstone on 7 February 2024. It sported a mostly bare carbon livery, with streaks of blue and pink across the car. Two liveries were released, a traditional blue one and a pink one in partnership with title sponsors BWT. It originally sported little colour, but from pre-season testing onwards, a blue stripe was added across the front nose cone. The pink livery was unchanged. The car made its first appearance at the 2024 Bahrain Grand Prix. A lighter chassis appeared at the Chinese Grand Prix.\n\n\n== Season summary ==\nThe Alpine A524's performance on track compared to previous cars was immediately deemed to be lacking at the Bahrain Grand Prix, locking out the last two places on the grid during qualifying and finishing seventeenth and eighteenth behind Valtteri Bottas, who had suffered a slow pit stop, and Logan Sargeant. Alpine's woes continued into the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix with both drivers once again suffering a Q1 knockout with Ocon in seventeenth and Gasly eighteenth. While Gasly retired after the formation lap due to a gearbox problem, Ocon finished in thirteenth. At the Australian Grand Prix, Ocon made it to Q2 but was only able to qualify in fifteenth, and Gasly was knocked out of Q1 once again in seventeenth. Gasly finished in thirteenth and Ocon sixteenth - last on track after George Russell retired, with Gasly receiving a five-second time penalty for crossing the pit exit line. The Japanese Grand Prix saw Ocon qualify fifteenth once again with Gasly in seventeenth, with both drivers finishing fifteenth and sixteenth respectively.\nThe first sprint weekend of the Chinese Grand Prix saw Gasly and Ocon qualify sixteenth and seventeenth respectively, with Ocon finishing thirteenth and Gasly fifteenth. Both Alpines made it into Q2 for qualifying for the main race, with Ocon, who qualified thirteenth, finishing eleventh and Gasly, who qualified fifteenth, finishing thirteenth.\n\n\n== Complete Formula One results ==\n(key)\n\n* Season still in progress\n\n\n== References ==",

It was the successor of Pomgol and was created by a resolution of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.\nThe commission included representatives of the State Planning Committee, All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions, Children's Commission of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, People's Commissariat of Agriculture, ROKK, International Working Committee for Famine Relief, etc.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 12 September 1922, Pomgol was ordered to be abolished and replaced by Posledgol by a decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. On the same day, Pomgol committees were dissolved and the resolution expressed gratitude to the ARA for donating eighty million gold rubles and for its contribution.\nOn 15 October 1922, Pomgol was reorganized as Posledgol which was led by Lev Kamenev. The reorganisation was due to shift in government policy from “struggle against the famine” to “struggle against the consequences of the famine” This new policy covered up the situation when necessary which led to confusion and inadequacies in places where famine was experienced. The commission was formed under the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions. Posledgol mainly planned and supervised relief activities. The commission received resources from state and donations by population. They portended enormous complications and inadequacies in handling the actual situation in the famine areas. Crimean Pomgol changed its name to Posledgol on 19 October 1922.\nA special Posledgol 1% tax was levied on population, excluding single housewives households and those without livestock, for famine relief. The 0.5% tax was extracted in famine areas. Posledgol and Nansen Mission organized the sale of Russian handicrafts abroad for “the reconstruction of the peasant craft industry”.\nPosledgol waged a campaign against the American Relief Administration. On 1 October 1922, the campaign to discredit the ARA. All foreign relief agencies were ordered to pay a part of administrative expenses incurred in rendering relief and were forbidden to operate kitchens in areas where government institutions were present. Centers and kitchens were to be administered under the coordination of Posledgol. On 31 October, orders went out to all branches from Olga Kameneva that Posledgol must impose regulations on foreign open kitchens, \"which must result in closing most of them.\"\nIn April 1923, ARA was ordered to turn over the proceeds from sales of empty grain sacks to Posledgol. On 26 May, Karl Lander ordered to not allow ARA to send its medical supplies to hospitals or private individuals and instead hand over all containers and surplus food to Posledgol.\nOn 1 August 1923, Posledgol was liquidated and was succeeded by Committee on Foreign Aid (Komitet zagranichnoi pomoshchi, or KZP).\n\n\n== See also ==\nPomgol\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wooden houses are houses constructed primarily from wood. \nThere have long been many types of wooden houses, the main building models of which are:\n\nhouse with pole/beam structure;\nThe house made of solid plywood panels;\nthe wooden frame house;\nthe stacked solid wood house (planks, trunks or logs, wooden block).\n\n\n== Benefits ==\n\nWood, like stone and brick, is a durable construction material, thus allowing wooden houses to stand for decades or even long; there are several hundred-year-old half-timbered houses in different parts of Europe (Germany, France, Norway, Switzerland, etc.) and in Asia.\n\n\n=== Wood and carbon dioxide emissions ===\n\nDuring the manufacture of materials used in the development of any home, energy is consumed but especially pollution is released into the atmosphere in the form of mainly CO2. Depending on the materials processed, the amount of CO2 produced differs. Wood can reduce the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere by half. In addition, wood has a significant CO2 storage capacity, which limits its release. However, the destruction of wood (natural or by combustion) results in the release into the atmosphere of all the CO2 previously stored.\nAnother environmental aspect of a wood construction site is the small amount of waste on the site because all the waste can be recycled or burned in a heater.\n\n\n== House with pole/beam structure ==\n\nThe supporting structure of the house consists of columns and beams usually made of solid wood or glulam, rigidly assembled between them which gives it a great formability. Between these load-bearing elements are inserted bay windows that, when fixed, can be installed without the use of intermediate joinery, non-load-bearing insulating masonry blocks (for example, hemp concrete blocks), wall elements that may consist of a wood frame (as in the wood frame house described below) or a stack of planks as in the case of the frame «at the meagevanne» (Megève region).These walls serve as fillers and have no bearing role. The construction can be done on site, but gains a lot of precision and reliability to be carried out in a workshop. This type of construction allows large spans preserving large free volumes and very open facades. Its complexity of realization usually reserves it for quality achievements or southern facades of bioclimatic constructions.\n\n\n== House in solid wood panels ==\nThis mode of construction tends to develop in France. It is common in Austria, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. The main manufacturers are: Schilliger, KLH, Finnforest, Binderholz, MHM, Biospeedhome, etc.\nThis wood construction technique is a combination of frame systems and solid timber: aesthetically, it has the same appearance interests as the wood frame house (cladding, coating, painted or rough on the outside on a reported insulation and with multiple possible finishes for the interior, including the natural wood appearance of the panels), with the performance of solid wood in terms of inertia. The solid panel material makes it possible to optimize the use of wood by giving it equivalent mechanical characteristics in all directions, eliminating the veil and deformations due to aging or hygrometry, and allowing unprecedented architectural freedom.\nThis system is expected to develop with the increase in the energy and thermal performance of buildings.   It is also recognized that massive panel constructions are more earthquake resistant [ref.  needed]. There are currently buildings of more than six floors composed of panels, some even reaching ten floors.\nThe current techniques allow the realization in the factories of walls of great length (up to 24 m) and variable thickness (from 7.8 to 50 cm) obtained by the assembly of wooden boards glued or nailed to each other in multiple crossed folds. This type of wood construction ensures remarkable stability over time.\nThese panels against glued can make a house from floor to ceiling. The house can be built on a conventional concrete slab, or on stilts, in which case the floor can also be laid in panel. All walls made with this type of panel are load-bearing. Floors and roofs can also be made as well.\nThese panels are resistant to strong overhangs, which allows balconies without support by beams.\n\n\n== Wooden frame house ==\nThe wood frame house is the best construction technique for most regional styles, so it's the most common. The walls of the wooden frame house are made on the basis of a structure consisting of wooden frames spaced 40 or 60 cm apart (in general) between which are placed the insulating materials. This construction technique also allows the prefabrication of complete walls in the factory, sheltered from the weather. The completion of the canopy enclosure can be achieved in just a few days, since there is no drying time.\nThe tendency to better insulate houses leads more and more to double this framework with external peripheral insulation of heavy insulating material (type wood fiber for example) that improves insulation, provides better thermal dephasing for the benefit of summer comfort and eliminates all thermal bridges attributable to the wood frame. The wooden frame house allows more economical and quick to implement expansions.\n\nExterior cladding serves as a bulwark against bad weather. It is often made of cladding, that is, wooden boards that can be painted, treated or left natural. Wood (especially untreated) exposed to sunlight and the elements will take on a gray hue over time, but will not lose any of its mechanical qualities. The exterior siding can also be made with a coating.\nThe inner walls  are most often made with plaster panels offering multiple possibilities of finishes (paint, wallpaper, etc.).\n\n\n=== Prefabrication ===\nOne of the advantages of wood frame construction is that it allows the workshop manufacture of wall panels, dry, safe. Once the walls are finished, they are loaded on a semi-trailer and then mounted on the site using a crane arm or crane.\nThus, in two days, the walls are standing; it remains only the floors or framework to mount before the house is out of water. This manufacturing method requires anticipation, good supply management, design mastered to the millimeter, synchronization with other trades, but it ensures that the wood has not been subjected for several weeks to bad weather (unlike mounting walls on the slab).\nA more successful stage of prefabrication is to manufacture in advance, in the workshop, the floors and the frames. For example, a framework is in the form of boxes that are mounted on site by a crane.\n\n\n== Insulation ==\nIt is often argued in favor of the wooden house that for a quality of insulation identical to that of a masonry construction, the wall of a wooden construction is 40% thinner, This represents additional significant square meters in case of urban planning constraints and resale. In practice, the interest of wood construction lies, among other things, in the possibility of making a house much better insulated and more comfortable than a masonry house. Therefore, it is logical to increase the insulation thickness significantly, as explained above, the additional cost being very limited as a percentage of the total construction price, and in any case minimal compared to the expected energy savings. In addition, since a wooden house is not designed on the model of a masonry house, there is a good chance that the architecture and surfaces will differ. The surface gain is therefore no longer significant.\nHowever, the thermal resistance of the materials used for the construction of wooden frame houses is different from the materials used for the construction of traditional houses. The thickness of the different materials for the same thermal resistance (0.50 m2 °C W 1) is as follows:\n\nsolid concrete: 88 cm;\nHollow block: 52 cm;\nPisé: 39 cm;\nSolid brick: 28 cm;\nSoftwood: 7.5 cm;\nhemp concrete: 6.5 cm;\ncork, cellulose panels, mineral wool: 2 cm.\nThe surface gain will depend on the type of construction as well as the type of material used.\n\n\n== Stacked solid wood house and wooden masonry ==\n\nOften called a cottage, it consists of solid wood walls mounted in stacks of planks (rectangular finish), logs (smooth finish) or charcoal (rustic finish).\nWood masonry is the use of solid wood blocks. These are stacked using the masonry technique. This technique gives the opportunity to realize all architectures, promotes self-construction and the realization of solid wood house with a minimum of tools.                                       \nNew techniques now make it possible to mount a wooden chalet by assembling pre-cut wooden planks in kit. The thickness of the planks is generally between 28 and 60 mm depending on the manufacturer and the range. The assembly takes place in stages following a manual and requires very little knowledge in carpentry or framing.\n\n\n== Lack of inertia ==\nDespite its thickness, solid wood has a so-called light inertia. This is why this wooden construction technique is very common in North American countries or in the mountainous regions of Europe.\nOn the other hand, wood is an average insulator (lambda coefficient of 0.12) compared to materials specifically intended for this use (0.04 on average for rock wool, wood fibre, cellulose or hemp). To obtain an insulation coefficient comparable to that of a wood frame wall, it is essential to add a thickness of insulation, ideally from the outside, so as to benefit from the inertia of solid wood inside the construction. The exterior insulation can then be lined with thick boards that will restore the «chalet» spirit. It is no longer necessary to provide insulation inside. This allows the occupants to fully enjoy the warm presence of wood, for a long time.\nThe modern design of the stacked solid timber construction allows very significant thermal gains by the design of the walls of the buildings: simple timber with insulation from the outside (avoids thermal bridges that cause significant thermal leakage) or double planks that trap the insulation (the thickness of which can vary depending on the location and needs).\nThe species most frequently used for this type of construction are larch, spruce, red cedar, scots pine and douglas fir.\nNew wooden houses usually offer very reliable insulation thanks to a double plank system with insulation in between. For example, instead of having a wood thickness of 120 mm, there are two 60 mm planks with a layer of 80 mm insulation inside.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nWoodworking must meet certain criteria to have a home offering the best possible quality. It is important to take into consideration when the tree needs to be felled, and the method of drying, to obtain strong and well-preserved wood.\nThe tree must be cut in winter, or possibly in autumn, when the tree is at rest and the sap circulates very slowly [ref.necessary]. It is then said to be \"not sap\", and therefore less prone to fermentation and insect attacks.\nNatural drying, which can take at least a year, offers even better resistance to timber [ref. needed]. It must be protected from the elements, but stored in the open air, to have a good air circulation and thus avoid the accumulation of moisture and proliferation of fungi and other parasites, then be stored for a week in the dry, in a depot, before being worked.\nIndustrial wood does not always respect the right cutting season. It is also cut in spring and summer, and undergoes kiln drying, which gives construction wood, certainly cheaper to acquire, but also, of lower quality and will have to be treated more often.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBuilding with wood.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Washington Apartments were constructed in 1922 to house factory workers from the nearby Reo Motor Car Company Plant. It was one of the largest residential apartment buildings constructed in Lansing during this period in the early 20th century. The building was funded by developer Lewis F. Breitenwischer, who had previously constructed apartment buildings in the area. Breitenwischer commissioned local architect Judson N. Churchill to design the building and hired Reniger Construction Company to build it. Constrction began in ate 1922 and the apartment building was completed in 1923.\nWith the onset of the Great Depression, Breitenwischer defaulted on his mortgage bonds, and in 1932 the building was transferred to new management. In 1944 the building was sold to the Lansing Washington Apartments, Inc. However, the building was plagued with issues in the 21st century. The city of Lansing issued citations in 2012 and 2015. The city of Lansing ordered the building be vacated in September 2019 because the owners did not have a valid rental certificate. It remained vacant through 2024.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Washington Apartments are a six-story Colonial Revival rectangular brick building with a flat asphalt roof. The front facade of the building contains three projecting bays; the main entrance is located in the central bay. An ornate painted wooden entryway surrounds the entrance doors. Each floor of the building contains double hung windows of varying sizes throughout. The building retains its original appearance with only minor modifications.\n\n\n== References ==",

The National Film and Sound Archive recently obtained a copy of this script.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe movie was previewed to the trade in May 1918 and submitted for censorship in June 1918.\nIt was released in September 1918 and screeed at J Tait's cinema in Melbourne.\nThe movie was still being screened in cinemas in Perth in the middle of 1921. In October 1923 the film was occasionally being screened in England.\n\n\n=== Critical ===\nThe Advertiser called it \"a highly acceptable film version of the expedition... The nature of the story precludes any highly artistic display of acting talent, and. added realism was given\nto the picture by the natural manner in which the respective roles were filled.\"\nAccording to the Sydney Sun:\n\nEven without the aid of romantic trimmings this story of an ill-fated expedition offers abundant material for a picture of great historic and dramatic significance. Such a picture has yet to be produced. The version presented... merely touches surface possibilities. It sketches lightly for juvenile minds the salient features of tho expedition, but Barely does justice to the memory of the Intrepid explorers. The hero of tho first three reels is the \"Lord\" (sic) Mayor of Melbourne. At all events ho keeps tlio centre of tho stage and gets all tlie limelight, Burke and his companions appearing only as incidentals. Even on tho Journey Burke does not come into his own.\nThe Perth Call said \"The acting was hopeless, the thing was strung out with yards of foolish title, the story was padded with minuet dances, and incidents that had no bearing on the theme, and the actually \"bush\" scenes looked as if they had been enacted with the utmost hardship in the fastnesses of Footscray.. it is a plain travesty on the name of decent filmdom.\"\nArthur Tinsdale had legal troubles with Francis Birtles about stolen films including On the Track of Burke and Wills.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Romance of the Burke and Wills Expedition of 1860 at IMDb \nThe Romance of Burke and Wills Expedition at National Film and Sound Archive",

        "content": "The Hindu figure of Rama is often presented as an ideal man, representing the epitome of righteousness, compassion, duty, sacrifice, and leadership, making him an enduring symbol of ethical and moral conduct. Rama's adherence to righteousness, or dharma, is a central aspect of his symbolism as an ideal man. Throughout the Ramayana, Rama consistently upholds the principles of dharma, fulfilling his duties as a son, a prince, a husband, and a ruler with unwavering integrity and adherence to ethical conduct. His commitment to truth and justice, even in the face of personal sacrifice and adversity, sets an example of moral rectitude. Rama's compassion and empathy towards all beings further enhance his symbolism as an ideal man. He extends kindness and understanding to those in need, regardless of their background or status. His interactions with various characters in the Ramayana, such as his friendship with Hanuman and his compassion towards the vanaras (monkey warriors), highlight his universal love and compassion for all living beings.\n\nDuty, or karma, is another key element of Rama's symbolism as an ideal man. He embraces his responsibilities as a prince, husband, and ruler with a sense of duty and dedication, showcasing the importance of selfless service and leadership. Rama's willingness to uphold his duties, even at great personal cost, exemplifies the virtue of selflessness and devotion to the welfare of others. Sacrifice is a profound aspect of Rama's symbolism as an ideal man. His willingness to sacrifice personal desires and comforts for the greater good, such as accepting exile from his kingdom to honor his father's word, reflects his selfless nature and commitment to higher ideals. Rama's sacrifice is not limited to his own well-being but extends to his loved ones, as seen in his separation from Sita to uphold societal norms and principles. Leadership is another quality symbolized by Rama as an ideal man. His ability to inspire and guide others through his actions, wisdom, and compassion makes him a model leader. Whether leading his army in battle or governing his kingdom with fairness and justice, Rama exemplifies the qualities of a noble and effective leader who prioritizes the welfare of his people above personal gain.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nRama, the seventh avatar of Vishnu in Hindu mythology, is revered for embodying profound symbolism that transcends religious boundaries and resonates with people across cutures. His life, as depicted in the epic Ramayana, is a testament to timeless ideals of righteousness, compassion, duty, and selflessness, making him a revered figure. One of the central themes surrounding Rama is his unwavering commitment to righteousness, known as dharma in Hindu philosophy. Throughout the Ramayana, Rama upholds the principles of dharma, fulfilling his duties as a son, a prince, a husband, and a king with utmost integrity and adherence to ethical conduct. His actions serve as a moral compass, teaching the importance of upholding truth and righteousness even in the face of adversity. Rama's compassion and empathy towards all beings are also prominent aspects of his symbolism. He demonstrates kindness and understanding towards those in need, regardless of their background or status. His relationship with Hanuman, the devoted monkey god, exemplifies the bond of friendship and loyalty that transcends barriers of species and hierarchy, emphasizing the universal values of love and compassion. Moreover, his loyal friendship with Sugriva and Vibhishina proved him to be a loyal friend.\nDuty, or karma in Sanskrit, is another key element of Rama's symbolism. He fulfills his responsibilities as a prince, husband, and ruler with a sense of duty and dedication, setting an example of selfless service and leadership. Rama's exile from Ayodhya and his subsequent journey through challenging circumstances underscore the importance of accepting one's duties and responsibilities with grace and resilience. The character of Rama also embodies selflessness and sacrifice. His willingness to sacrifice personal comforts and even his own happiness for the greater good reflects the essence of selflessness and devotion to the welfare of others. The ultimate sacrifice of Rama's beloved wife, Sita, and his unwavering commitment to justice and righteousness in the face of temptation and trials further highlight his selfless nature. For his ideals and symbolism he is often called Maryada-Purshottama    (lit. \"The great man who follows righteousness\")\n\nAccording to Sheldon Pollock, the life of Rama as told in the Indian texts is a masterpiece that offers a framework to represent, conceptualise and comprehend the world and the nature of life. Like major epics and religious stories around the world, it has been of vital relevance because it \"tells the culture what it is\". Rama's life is more complex than the Western template for the battle between the good and the evil, where there is a clear distinction between immortal powerful gods or heroes and mortal struggling humans. In the Indian traditions, particularly Rama, the story is about a divine human, a mortal god, incorporating both into the exemplar who transcends both humans and gods.\nAccording to Rodrick Hindery, Book 2, 6 and 7 are notable for ethical studies. The views of Rama combine \"reason with emotions\" to create a \"thinking hearts\" approach. Second, he emphasises through what he says and what he does a union of \"self-consciousness and action\" to create an \"ethics of character\". Third, Rama's life combines the ethics with the aesthetics of living. The story of Rama and people in his life raises questions such as \"is it appropriate to use evil to respond to evil?\", and then provides a spectrum of views within the framework of Indian beliefs such as on karma and dharma.\n\n\n== As an ideal son ==\n\nRama's symbolism as an ideal son in Hindu mythology is deeply rooted in his unwavering devotion, obedience, and respect towards his parents, particularly his father Dasharatha. His commitment to duty and righteousness exemplify the qualities expected of an ideal son. Rama's obedience to his father's wishes is prominently showcased in the Ramayana's narrative. Despite the personal sacrifice involved, he willingly accepts his father's decree to go into exile for fourteen years. This act reflects his selflessness and willingness to uphold his father's honor and word, even at great personal cost. Throughout his exile, Rama maintains a sense of duty towards his parents. He ensures that his mother, Queen Kaushalya, is informed of his well-being through messengers and remains devoted to her despite being away from her. Additionally, Rama's sense of responsibility towards his family extends to his care and protection of his younger brothers, especially Bharata. He respects Bharata's love for their father and honors his desire to rule Ayodhya in their absence, showcasing his understanding and empathy towards familial relationships.\n\n\n== As an ideal husband ==\n\nRama's symbolism as an ideal husband is a central theme in Hindu mythology, particularly depicted in the Ramayana. His relationship with Sita epitomizes the qualities expected of an ideal husband. One of Rama's key attributes as an ideal husband is his unwavering loyalty and devotion to Sita. Despite numerous challenges and adversities, including her abduction by Ravana, Rama's love and commitment to Sita remain steadfast. He undertakes a perilous journey to rescue her, showcasing his determination and courage in protecting his wife. Rama also demonstrates exemplary trust and respect towards Sita. When doubts arise about her purity during their return to Ayodhya, Rama, as a just and fair husband, prioritizes public opinion over his personal feelings and asks Sita to undergo the Agni Pariksha (trial by fire) to prove her innocence. This event highlights Rama's adherence to righteousness and justice, even when it involves his beloved wife.\nMoreover, Rama's sense of duty towards Sita is evident throughout their relationship. He ensures her safety and well-being, even when faced with difficult choices and sacrifices. His actions reflect his commitment to protecting and caring for his wife, embodying the ideals of devotion, loyalty, trust, and responsibility expected of an ideal husband in Hindu culture.\n\n\n== As an ideal brother ==\n\nRama's symbolism as an ideal brother is prominently showcased in the Ramayana, particularly in his relationships with his brothers, Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna. His qualities as an ideal brother include loyalty, support, selflessness, and mutual respect. Rama's relationship with Lakshmana is particularly noteworthy. Lakshmana's unwavering devotion and dedication to Rama's service highlight Rama's role as a beloved elder brother. In return, Rama deeply values Lakshmana's companionship and sacrifices, such as accompanying him into exile without hesitation. Their bond symbolizes fraternal love, trust, and unity, serving as an exemplary model of brotherly devotion. Additionally, Rama's relationship with Bharata underscores his qualities as an ideal brother. Despite the misunderstandings and challenges surrounding Dasharatha's death and Bharata's temporary assumption of the throne, Rama remains compassionate and forgiving towards Bharata. He understands Bharata's love for their father and respects his brother's integrity, ultimately reuniting with Bharata and restoring harmony within the family.\nFurthermore, Rama's role as an ideal brother extends to his interactions with Shatrughna, whom he supports and guides with wisdom and affection. Their bond reflects mutual respect and camaraderie, emphasizing Rama's role as a pillar of strength and mentorship within the family.\n\n\n== As an ideal friend ==\n\nRama's symbolism as an ideal friend is demonstrated through his relationship with Hanuman in the Ramayana. Their bond exemplifies qualities such as loyalty, trust, mutual respect, and selfless devotion. Rama's friendship with Hanuman is marked by mutual admiration and trust. Hanuman, the devoted devotee of Rama, exemplifies unwavering loyalty and dedication. He plays a crucial role in helping Rama in his quest to rescue Sita, showcasing his friendship's depth and commitment. On Rama's part, he deeply values Hanuman's friendship and acknowledges his extraordinary abilities and devotion. Rama recognizes Hanuman as an invaluable ally and friend, treating him with respect and affection throughout their journey. Moreover, Rama's trust in Hanuman's abilities is evident when he sends him on a crucial mission to locate Sita in Lanka. Rama's confidence in Hanuman's capabilities underscores the trust and reliance they have on each other as friends.\n\nFurthermore, Rama's friendship with Hanuman transcends mere companionship; it embodies spiritual and emotional bonds based on shared values and common goals. Their friendship serves as a timeless example of the qualities expected in an ideal friendship, including trust, loyalty, selflessness, and mutual support, making Rama and Hanuman revered symbols of friendship and camaraderie in Hindu mythology. Rama's symbolism as an ideal friend extends beyond his relationship with Hanuman to include his interactions with Vibhishana and Sugriva in the Ramayana, showcasing diverse aspects of friendship such as trust, forgiveness, support, and loyalty. His bond with Vibhishana, Ravana's brother who ultimately allies with Rama, exemplifies trust and forgiveness. Despite Vibhishana's initial association with Ravana, Rama recognizes his righteousness and accepts him as an ally. This friendship is built on mutual respect, with Rama valuing Vibhishana's counsel and assistance during the battle against Ravana. Rama's friendship with Sugriva, the vanara king, highlights support and loyalty. When Sugriva seeks Rama's help in reclaiming his kingdom from Vali, Rama not only assists him in defeating Vali but also fulfills his promise by making Sugriva the rightful king. This alliance is rooted in mutual benefit and solidarity, with Rama and Sugriva standing by each other in times of need.\nOverall, Rama's relationships with Hanuman, Vibhishana, and Sugriva collectively embody the qualities of an ideal friend: trust, loyalty, forgiveness, support, and mutual respect. These friendships in the Ramayana serve as timeless examples of camaraderie and companionship, emphasizing the importance of genuine bonds built on shared values and trustworthiness.\n\n\n== As an ideal king ==\n\nRama's symbolism as an ideal king in Hindu mythology is multifaceted, encompassing qualities such as righteousness, justice, duty, sacrifice, and empathy. One of the most poignant examples illustrating Rama's commitment to his role as a just ruler is the sacrifice he makes for the sake of upholding his subjects' trust and maintaining societal order. In the Ramayana, when doubts arise regarding Queen Sita's purity upon their return to Ayodhya, Rama, as a king deeply committed to moral principles and public perception, prioritizes the welfare of his kingdom over personal emotions. Despite his unwavering love for Sita, he chooses to honor the doubts of his people and asks Sita to undergo the Agni Pariksha (trial by fire) to prove her innocence. This act of sacrificing his own happiness and the bond with his beloved wife demonstrates Rama's sense of duty and responsibility towards his subjects. By prioritizing public opinion and ensuring the integrity of his kingdom's moral fabric, Rama upholds the ideals of justice, fairness, and accountability expected of an ideal king.\nFurthermore, Rama's sacrifice of personal happiness for the greater good exemplifies his selflessness and willingness to make difficult decisions for the welfare of his people. His actions underscore the moral and ethical standards set for kingship, emphasizing the importance of integrity, sacrifice, and empathy in governance and leadership.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRama\nRamayana\nExile of Lord Rama\nList of characters in Ramayana\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "David Ortega Gutiérrez (born 1966) is a Spanish academic and former politician. He served on the City Council of Madrid from 2011 to 2015, as leader of the Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD) group.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nOrtega was born in Madrid and raised in its Estrella neighbourhood. He graduated in law from the Autonomous University of Madrid and completed a doctorate in political sciences at the same institution, with studies at the University of Oxford, Georgetown University and McMaster University along the way. He has a further master's degree in philosophy from the Francisco de Vitoria University and was a substitute judge in Torrejón de Ardoz from 2000 to 2001. He became a professor of constitutional law at the King Juan Carlos University.\nOrtega attended the first congress of Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD) in November 2009. A year later, he was chosen as their nominee for mayor of Madrid in the 2011 Madrid City Council election. His party came fourth with 7.85% of the vote, earning five seats on the council.\nDuring his term in office, Ortega and his party returned the official cars and chauffeurs granted to them, as per their campaign promises. He also opposed Madrid's candidacy for the 2020 Summer Olympics, citing a survey showing 76% opposition across the capital.\nOrtega retained his candidacy for the 2015 Madrid City Council election, taking over 80% of votes cast, though just over a quarter of registered UPyD members voted. The party lost all its seats and he left its national executive. He left the party fully at the end of 2015, saying that it had failed in the general election by its own errors.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Swami Gautamanandaji Maharaj was elected the President of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission at the meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Math and the Governing Body of the Mission held at Belur Math on 24 April 2024.  He is the 17th President of the twin organizations.  He succeeds Swami Smarananandaji Maharaj who passed away on 26 March 2024.[1][2][3]\nSwami Gautamanandaji was born in Bengaluru in 1929, though his ancestors were all from Tamil Nadu.  In his youth days, he came in contact with Bengaluru branch of the Ramakrishna Order, headed by Swami Yatishwarananda Maharaj (1889–1966).   He received Mantra Diksha (spiritual initiation) from Swami Yatishwaranandaji in 1955.  The following year, he embraced monastic life by joining New Delhi branch of the Ramakrishna Mission as per the advice of his guru.  He spent six years in Delhi centre getting introduced to monastic life and serving in different departments.\nHe received Brahmacharya vows from Swami Vishuddhanandaji Maharaj (in 1962) and Sannyasa ordination and the name ‘Swami Gautamananda’ (in 1966) from Swami Vireshwaranandaji Maharaj, the 10th President of the Ramakrishna Order.\nIn 1964, he moved from Delhi to the Mission’s centre in Sohra (formerly Cherrapunjee) and then to the centre in Mumbai.  In these two centres he served for about 12 years altogether.  Subsequently, he was appointed the head of the Mission’s centre in the remote tribal village Aalo (formerly Along) in Arunachal Pradesh in 1976.  He served there for 13 long years bringing the light of education to tribal children.  During his leadership, the centre in Aalo attained national stature and reached new heights.\nHe became a Trustee of the Ramakrishna Math and a Member of the Governing Body of the Ramakrishna Mission in March 1990.  Thereafter, he served brief stints as the head of Raipur and Narainpur centres (in Chhattisgarh) and Saradapitha centre (adjacent to Belur Math).\nFrom Saradapitha he went on to become the head of Ramakrishna Math, Chennai, in 1995—a responsibility that he shouldered for almost three decades. Under his stewardship, the activities and influence of this important branch expanded significantly.  He also lent his support to the starting of new branches of the Math and Mission in places like Puducherry (a union territory), Kadapa & Tirupati (in Andhra Pradesh), Chengam, Thanjavur, Thirumukkudal & Villupuram (in Tamil Nadu), and nurtured scores of unaffiliated centres in Tamil Nadu.\nHe started his spiritual ministry in 2012 following the authorization given to him by the Trustees to give spiritual initiation to devotees.  A few years later, in 2017, he was elected a Vice-President of the Order.\nAs a Diksha Guru and Vice-President, he travelled extensively in India and different parts of the world and visited the branches of the Math and Mission and also unaffiliated centres in those places.  Through those visits he endeavoured to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda and Vedanta among a vast number of people and gave Mantra Diksha to many spiritual seekers.  He has contributed several articles to various journals of the Ramakrishna Order.  His physical fitness, mental alertness and jovial nature even at this advanced age are an inspiration to the younger generation.[4]",

        "content": "Mura was a very powerful asura (demon) mentioned in Hindu scriptures, who served as a general in Narakasura's army. Narakasura was the evil demon King of Pragjyotisha, and Mura along with his daughter Ahilavati played an important role in defending the Kingdom of Pragjyotisha from invaders.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMura was born to the sage Kashyap and his wife Danu. Once Mura was shocked to see a heap of dead bodies of the asuras and danavas who died in battle against the Devas who were immortal. He became sad and was afraid that he too would die in battle one day. So he did penance for many years to propitiate Lord Brahma who was also his great-grandfather. Eventually, Brahma appeared before him and offered him a boon. He asked for invincibility in battle, even against the devas who were immortal. After attaining is special powers he defeated the Yakshas and the Gandharvas in battle. Then he challenged the Devas, but no one dared to stop him. So he went to Amaravati where Indra ruled the heavens and forcefully usurped his kingdom. Mura also took possession of the Vajra and Airavata from Indra. All the devas were terrified and were banished from the heavens. For many years he ruled unopposed as the King of the heavens and all the asuras and danavas prospered under his rule. After attaining so much success he became extremely arrogant due to the power of his boons. Maddened with power he went to Vaikuntha to challenge Lord Vishnu. But upon reaching there he came to know that Shri Krishna had been born as an incarnation of Vishnu and was about to attack the Kingdom of Pragjyotisha where another powerful danava King Narakasura was the King. Narakasura was said to have abducted 16,000 women from the earth and made them captives. So Mura decided to go to earth and become Narakasura's general and defend his kingdom. But Shri Krishna and Satyabhama on hearing about the misdeeds of Naraka decided to go and defeat him in battle and emancipate the 16,000 captive princesses. Sri Krishan was also aware of Mura's presence and his special powers. So he took Satyabhama (incarnation of Bhudevi) along with him to defeat the combined forces of Mura and Narakasura. \n\n\n== Hindu Scriptures ==\nThe story of Mura finds mention in the Hindu epic Mahabharta, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vamana Purana. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Maqam Sheikh al-Qatrawani (Arabic: مقام الشيخ القطرواني) is an Islamic shrine, located on the Dahrat Hamoud hill about 1.5 km south-west of Atara in Palestine. The maqam was first established during the Mamluk rule over Palestine as one of a series of 16th-century watchtowers overlooking the nearby coast. It stands at 820 metres above sea level.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe shrine was established in the 16th century during the Mamluk period on top of the ruins of a Byzantine monastery. The shrine was also given a renovation in the year 1999. Sherds from the Byzantine, Crusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk eras have been found here.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe sanctuary is a rectangular building which is 9.8 meters in width, and 5.9 meters in length. It has two semi-spherical domes, measuring 3.8 and 3.9 meters in diameter respectively. The eastern dome is built of finely cut stones, while the western dome is built of small rough field-stones, but both kinds are of local origin. The northern wall is 85 centimeters thick and is constructed of small stones, mortar and rubble. The eastern room of the sanctuary contains a mihrab with the typical orientation to Mecca, as required in Islamic doctrine.\nThe cistern, currently blocked, is in front of the shrine and most likely collected rainwater in the past for the sanctuary. It possibly also drew water from the nearby spring of Wadi as-Saqi, located two kilometers south of the site. To the west of the shrine is a winepress cut through stone. Its basin is 1.8 metres deep and is coated with a layer of white plaster. A stone-cut cave is located in front of the shrine, but was blocked in 1984 by the residents of 'Atara for safety reasons. The tomb of Sheikh Ahmad al-Qatrawani, the building's namesake, is located west of the shrine's courtyard and has been plundered several times.\n\n\n== Local legends ==\nAccording to local legend, Sheikh Ahmad al-Qatrawani was a holy man from the town of Qatra, but left after his hometown after he could not continue his religious duties there. A group of villages saw him laying at Bir Zeit. When asked of his origins, the Sheikh said that he was from Qatra and that angels brought him to the site where he would die. The residents of Atara, as well as nearby Ajjul and Silwad provided him with food and protection for four years and when they found him dead, they buried him just west of the sanctuary. Another popular tale claims that when al-Qatrawani died, his dead body descended onto the hilltop where his sanctuary stands.\n\n\n== Christian tradition ==\nMany Palestinian Christians argue, however, that the site was dedicated to Saint Catherine, suggesting the etymological origin of \"Qatrawani\" to be from \"Catherine\". Hamdan Taha also points out similarities between the Muslim tradition of al-Qatrawani descending to his burial place at the time of his death to the Christian tradition of Saint Catherine descending to Mount Sinai at the time of her death.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMaqam (shrine)\n\n\n== References ==",

(trading as Kodezi) was incorporated in Delaware, United States, listing its founders Ishraq Khan and Mike Walsh on the board of directors.\nThe software development company based its GenAI software on the same model as Grammarly, a digital writing tool that, among other things, provides grammar and spell checking tools for its users.\nIn May 2022, the company raised 800,000 US dollars in its pre-seed round from Watertower Ventures and RTP Global.\nIn February 2023, Product Hunt, an American product discovery site owned by AngelList, listed Kodezi as product of the month on its front page.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn early 2018, Tavis Ormandy, a security researcher at Google who was formerly part of Google's Project Zero team, uncovered a vulnerability in Grammarly's browser extension, which exposed authentication tokens to websites and potentially allowing them to access the users' documents and other data, raising concerns about whether the same could be true for Kodezi's own software versions. Within a few hours, the companies released a hotfix and reported that it found no evidence of compromised user data.\nOn April 7, 2023, an article in the Harvard Business Review (HBR) argued about the uncertainty and challenges ahead for companies such as Kodezi that use and rely generative AI, citing that there were risks regarding infringement.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Kodezi Inc. at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Nevzat Yalçıntaş (1933–2016) was a Turkish economist, academic and conservative politician. He worked at Ankara University and Istanbul University. He headed a conservative think entitled Intellectuals' Hearth from 1988 to 1998. He served at the Parliament for two terms: from 1999 to 2002 and from 2007 and 2011. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nYalçıntaş was born in Keskin in 1933 and was raised in Ankara. He had nine siblings.\nYalçıntaş graduated from Ankara Commerce High School in 1951 and from Istanbul Higher School of Economics and Commerce in 1954. During his university education he became a member of the Nationalists Association (Turkish: Milliyetçiler Derneği) of which the president was Sait Bilgiç, a politician. Yalçıntaş received his Ph.D. in economics in 1957 from the Caen University, France.\n\n\n== Career and activities ==\nAfter his graduation, Yalçıntaş started his career as an expert at the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works. He joined Ankara University's Faculty of Political Sciences in 1959. Then he joined Istanbul University's Faculty of Economics where he worked until his retirement in 1999. He was a visiting scholar at the London School of Economics and Social Sciences between 1962 and 1963. He became an associate professor in 1965 and a full professor in 1971 at Istanbul University. One of his notable pupils at Istanbul University was Abdullah Gül, former President of Turkey.\nYalçıntaş was active in the Turkish National Student Union. He worked at the State Planning Organization from 1965. He served as a member of the European Migrant Workers Board between 1973 and 1975. He was named as the director general of the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) on 12 May 1975, and his appointment was accepted by President Fahri Korutürk. However, İsmail Cem who had been the director general of TRT appealed to the Council of State to annul the Presidential decree. In addition, the parliamentary group of the Republican People's Party also applied to the Constitutional Court arguing that the decree in question was unconstitutional. On 5 June 1975, the Council of State validated İsmail Cem's request. The cabinet led by Süleyman Demirel objected to the decision of the Council of State, but the Council rejected this objection. Ultimately, Yalçıntaş had to resign from the post on 24 November 1975.\nYalçıntaş was the president of the Research and Training Institute of the Islamic Development Bank based in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between 1982 and 1986 and the chief counselor and then chairman of the Advisory Board of the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) between 1986 and 1990. He also served as a senior consultant to many private companies.\nYalçıntaş was the president of the conservative think thank Intellectuals' Hearth from 1988 to 1998. Then he was involved in politics becoming a member of the Virtue Party. He was elected to the Parliament for the party representing Istanbul and served in the 21st term between 1999 and 2002. Later he joined the Justice and Development Party and served in the 23rd term of the Parliament as an Istanbul deputy between 2007 and 2011. \n\n\n=== Work and views ===\nYalçıntaş published many books, book chapters, articles, reports and communiqués mainly on Turkey's social structure and social politics. Some of his publications have been published in the German, Arabic, English and Japanese languages. He also contributed to Tercüman and was the editor-in-chief of the daily newspaper Türkiye.\nYalçıntaş had a nationalist-conservatist political stance. One of his mentors in this ideology was Korkut Özal.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nYalçıntaş was married and had two children. He was fluent in French, English and Arabic. \nYalçıntaş died of heart attack in Çatalca, Istanbul, on 15 July 2016 at the age of 83. After the funeral prayer at Fatih Mosque he was buried in New Topkapı Cemetery, Istanbul, on 17 July.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

This caused many protests erupting in different locations throughout Armenia. \nIn Yerevan, spontaneous protests led by the opposition occurred on April 24 and 25. Opposition leaders claim that police employed aggressive methods against protesters in the city on April 24. In other parts of the nation, demonstrations have resulted in temporary closures of national and regional highways, such as the Yerevan-Meghri highway, the Yerevan-Gyumri highway, the Baghanis-Voskepar highway, and the interstate highway connecting Armenia to Georgia.  On 26 April 2024, protestors continued to block streets in Yerevan and main highways outside the city to oppose the territorial concessions depicted by Nikol Pashinian’s administration as the beginning of Armenia’s border delineation with Azerbaijan. Some employed large vehicles for this objective. Law enforcement authorities intervened to reopen traffic on almost all of those routes. \n\n\n== See also ==\n2023 Armenian protests\n\n\n== References ==",

According to Valmiki Ramayana, Devarata Janaka received the famous divine bow of Lord Shiva named as \"Pinaka\" for its safe-keeping.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAccording to the texts, from the lifeless body of King Nimi after his death, Mithi was born who became the first King Janaka. Thereafter, King Mithi's son was Udavasu from whom Nandivardhana was born; his son was Suketu (also known as Sukesha) from whom Devarata was born. In Ramayana, Shreedwaja Janaka father of Sita, narrated the story of the divine bow Pinaka at the Swayamvar Sabha of Lord Rama and Goddess Sita in Mithila. He told that at the time of the destruction of Daksha Yagya, Lord Shiva told the Devatas, \"In your eagerness to participate in the Yagya, you could not take my share. So I will cut off your precious heads with my bow.\" Then the Devatas immediately apologized and received his grace. Lord Shiva then gifted them this bow which they later gave to our ancestor Devarata.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Apuí Táxi Aéreo is a Brazilian subregional airline and air taxi company headquartered in Manaus, Amazonas, which offers scheduled and non-scheduled passenger and cargo flights. \nAlthough the company had been founded in 1996 as an air taxi, it was not authorized to operate scheduled flights until 2024, when was certified certified by the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) under the Brazilian Civil Aviation Regulations (RBAC) No. 135.  \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment (1996-2002) ===\nThe history of Apuí Táxi Aéreo dates back to 1996, when the traditional Marmentini family, one of the pioneers of agribusiness in the southern region of Amazonas after migrating from Paraná, decided to create an air taxi company to meet the needs of the municipality of Apuí, whose Territorial extension is greater than that of some Brazilian states and European countries, which would become the largest agricultural province in the state. \nInitially, its fleet was made up of small aircraft, including the Embraer EMB 810 Seneca, a Brazilian version of the Piper Seneca produced under license from the North American Piper Aircraft. On August 23, 2000, Apuí Taxi Aéreo received its first Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, registration PT-ODJ (MSN 110034). \n\n\n=== Systematic Air Link (2002-2013) ===\nOn November 6, 2002, Apuí received its Air Operator Certificate (CHETA, in Portuguese) from the former Department of Civil Aviation (DAC), today ANAC, under the Brazilian Civil Aviation Regulation (RBAC) No. 119, to carry out flights in the Systematic Air Link (LAS) modality,   which at the time of its existence was a domestic air service equivalent to the regular air service, carried out by duly certified air taxi companies with aircraft with up to 30 seats, establishing the Eduardo Gomes International Airport, in Manaus, as its base of operations. Still in 2002, added the second EMB 110 Bandeirante, registration PT-ODY (MSN 110039), to the fleet. \nIn 2003, Apuí received certification from DAC to carry out aeronautical maintenance on its own fleet of EMB 110 Bandeirante and third parties, as well as inspection and some types of maintenance on Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-27 engines. \nIn July 2004, the airline incorporated its first EMB 110P1 Bandeirante, registration PT-OCW (MSN 110273), followed by two more aircraft, registrations PT-GKX (MSN 110129) and PT-GKE (MSN 110096), delivered until December 2005. At the end of 2005, Apuí offered systematic regular flights between Manaus, Apuí, Iauaretê, São Gabriel da Cachoeira and Manicoré, in addition to non-scheduled flights and air taxis to several other cities in the Amazonas region. \n\nIn 2007, Apuí added another EMB 110P1 Bandeirante, registration PT-LRR (MSN 110315), totaling six aircraft in the fleet; however, over time, most of them remained grounded due to maintenance problems, with the airline going into decline after 2008.\n\n\n==== Safety concerns ====\nOn June 5, 2013, the General Aviation Operations Management (GOAG) of the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) announced the suspension of Apuí Táxi Aéreo's CHETA (air operator certificate) after identifying irregularities in the airline's operations. The precautionary suspension would remain until the irregularities identified and pointed out to the airline through the administrative process opened by the agency were resolved.  \n\n\n=== Beechcraft Baron crash and crisis (2013-2018) ===\nOn July 16, 2013, just over a month after the suspension of CHETA due to concerns about the safety of its operations, Apuí Táxi Aéreo returned to the newspaper headlines after the Beechcraft 58 Baron registration PR-OKK, leased by the airline of a third operator to carry out an air taxi flight with employees of a state agency of the Amazonas government to the municipality of Apuí, crashing shortly after taking off from Eduardo Gomes International Airport, in Manaus, with a pilot and six passengers on board; there were no survivors.\nApuí came under public scrutiny and the investigation conducted by the Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) of the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) discovered that the leased plane was registered in the name of Cotrap (Constructora e Transportadora Pioneiro), a company belonging to the owners of the airline, and which was not authorized to conduct passenger flights, only private flights. Furthermore, the investigation uncovered a series of irregularities and violations of aviation safety standards by the airline and its administrators that resulted in the accident, resulting in the opening of a criminal case.  \nTarnished by the accident, on August 15, 2013, through Ordinance No. 2,095/2013 published in the Diário Oficial da União (DOU), the official journal of the federal government of Brazil, Apuí Táxi Aéreo recovered its CHETA, according to ANAC, after demonstrating that it adopted measures to mitigate the irregularities found in June and which led to the precautionary suspension. The company resumed its operations, however, with non-scheduled flights and air taxi services.  \nOn June 13, 2017, the airline's administrators were denounced by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office of Amazonas for violating the safety of air transport, a crime provided for in article 261 of the Brazilian Penal Code. On December 14, the court ordered Apui Táxi Aéreo, Cotrap and its administrators (the same as the airline) to pay compensation of R$1.5 million to the families of the victims.\n\n\n=== Resumption of regular flights (2018-2024) ===\nOn August 17, 2018, Apuí Taxi Aéreo ratified its air operator certificate under RBAC No. 119, once again having permission to carry out flights in the Systematic Air Link (LAS) modality. With a fleet now made up of two EMB 110 Bandeirante, Apuí has resumed its commercial flights between Manaus, Apuí and Manicore.\nOn December 3, 2021, after changes that occurred in Brazilian aeronautical regulations, which extinguished the Systematic Air Link modality and types of operations provided for in RBAC No. 119, starting to allow air taxi companies with aircraft with up to 19 seats to sell individual air tickets reorganized under RBAC No. 135 on certain rules, Apuí reorganized and was recertified by ANAC, allowing it to carry out non-scheduled flights and air taxi services. On January 9, 2023, the agency concluded a process of verifying the maintenance of Apuí's technical and operational conditions under the new rules, certifying that the company complied with them satisfactorily.  \nOn May 8, 2023, under the new modality of offering flights as an air taxi and after ANAC certified the runway at Barreirinha Airport for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, Apuí Táxi Aéreo began a weekly flight on Mondays between Manaus and Barreirinha. Flights were subsequently suspended indefinitely. However, it normally maintained its flights between Manaus, Apuí and Manicore.\n\n\n==== Request for scheduled commercial flights ====\nOn May 21, 2023, Apuí Táxi Aéreo formally requested National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (ANAC) for a meeting to formalize its request for authorization to carry out regular operations through an amendment to the Operational Specifications (EO) under RBAC No. 135, thus beginning its process to become a regional airline. Following the guidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the certification process for a new airline in Brazil is divided into five phases.\nOn January 26, 2024, Apuí successfully and satisfactorily completed all steps to obtain authorization for regular operations, carrying out verification flights with ANAC inspectors on board between November 22, 23, 26 and 28, in addition of the last one, carried out on December 20th, totaling 13 hours and 55 minutes in five flights (and ten sections) between the airports of Apuí, Barcelos, Coari, Manaus and Manicoré.\n\n\n=== Transformation into a regional airline (2024-present) ===\nOn March 4, 2024, Apuí Táxi Aéreo obtained authorization to carry out regular operations under the terms of the Operational Specifications (EO) contained in its RBAC No. 135 certification, being able to initially use its fleet of Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante on regular commercial flights between Manaus, Apuí and Manicoré, becoming the newest Brazilian regional airline. The process carried out by Apuí is similar to that used by Abaeté Aviação, which since 2020 has also become a regional airline through this same certification process.    \n\n\n==== Inaugural flight ====\nApuí Táxi Aéreo's inaugural flight as a regional airline is scheduled to take place on April 30, 2024, when flight Q1-0001 will take off from Eduardo Gomes International Airport to Apuí Airport, popularly known as Prainha Airport. After a stop to disembark and board passengers in Apuí, the plane takes off towards Manicoré Airport and returns directly to Manaus.\n\n\n== Destinations ==\nAs of April 2024, Apuí Táxi Aéreo operated scheduled services to the following destinations in Brazil:\n\n\n== Fleet ==\nAs of April 2024, the fleet of Apuí Táxi Aéreo includes the following aircraft:\n\n\n== See also ==\nAbaeté Aviação\nList of airlines of Brazil\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "André Eduardo Roque \"Eddie\" Mascarenhas (born 10 November 1941) is an Indian former theatre actor, theatre director, singer, and playwright who worked on the Konkani stage.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAndré Eduardo Roque Mascarenhas was born on 10 November 1981, in Calangute, Goa, which was a part of Portuguese India during the era of the Portuguese Empire. He was born into a Goan Catholic family to parents Paulino Raimundo de Penaforte Mascarenhas and Maria Eduvilda Delfina Serrão Mascarenhas, who hailed from Cuncolim and Colva respectively. Mascarenhas's family originated from Dandora in Cuncolim, Goa. During his childhood, Mascarenhas made his initial debut on the tiatr stage. It was at the Colva 'fama' event of Anton Sinforiano, where Mascarenhas sang a song in Sinforiano' tiatr and received positive feedback from the audience. This marked his entry into the Konkani stage. Mascarenhas's father, Paulino, was a policeman (Polícia do Estado da India), the same as Polícia de Segurança Pública, in the Portuguese regime and had a passion for tiatr, being involved as a tiatrist in villages alongside A. R. Souza Ferrão, among others. Paulino was a singer and actor, primarily participating in local tiatrs. Growing up in Pernem taluka, Mascarenhas resided there for more than 15 years due to his father's occupation as a police officer stationed there. The influence of his father's involvement in the Konkani stage sparked Mascarenhas's own enthusiasm for the tiatr scene, which he pursued further in his career.\nMascarenhas, whose father served in law enforcement, enjoyed the privilege of complimentary tickets to tiatrs, a traditional form of Goan musical theater. Accompanied by his father, he eagerly attended these performances and absorbed the melodic tunes, which he later recited from memory. Mascarenhas developed an affinity for singing, nurtured further by his cousin A. Serrão, a tiatr writer from Colva. Under Serrão's guidance, Mascarenhas was introduced to professional tiatrs by Anton Siforiano at Colva during the Fama event in front of Lakist's house. Actor-singers like Kamat de Assolna, Lucas, his cousin A. Serrão, M. Dod de Verna, and Kid Boxer were part of the performance. Mascarenhas delivered a solo performance featuring a composition by A. Serrão, which Mascarenhas delivered with skill and received acclaim from the audience. Mascarenhas was a mere 15 years old at the time. Subsequently, he enrolled at Guardian Angel High School in Sanvordem, a boarding school, where he actively participated in a myriad of school concerts and events, showcasing his vocal prowess.\nMascarenhas exhibited a penchant for truancy during his school years, often absconding from classes to attend the tiatrs that were regularly staged in and around Sanvordem. This period coincided with the tenure of Fr. Pinto as the school principal. It was during this time that Mascarenhas honed his skills in song composition within the school's premises. His artistic prowess eventually garnered attention when he was residing in Pernem, in a fortuitous turn of events, he was invited to perform at the Saude Saibin's feast (commemorating Our Lady of Health) in Cuncolim on 2 February. Mascarenhas enthralled the audience with two original compositions, both of which resonated and achieved acclaim. Mascarenhas talent captured the interest of Albuquerque and received the endorsement of Randolf. While residing in Pernem, Mascarenhas actively participated in the competitive singing contests held during the tiatr production titled Rinnkari,  orchestrated by Diogo Cardozo. This event attracted a constellation of professional singers and actors, including M. Boyer. Demonstrating vocal prowess, Mascarenhas emerged victorious, clinching the first prize for solo singing, which was bestowed upon him by M. Boyer himself. This triumph propelled Mascarenhas into the limelight, securing invitations to perform in a myriad of tiatrs across the locales of Pernem, Arambol, Corgao, Deussua, Mandrem, and Morjim.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMascarenhas's career spanned multiple years, and made significant contributions to the tiatr stage in both Goa and the Gulf region. He first ventured into the Gulf countries when he secured employment in Dubai, where he established a base for his artistic pursuits. Despite his professional commitments, he continued to actively participate in tiatr performances, showcasing his versatile talents as an actor and singer. However, his appearances on the Konkani stage in Goa were relatively limited during his vacations back home. Before his tenure in Dubai, Mascarenhas had already left a mark on the tiatr scene in Goa and Bombay. He had been involved in various theatrical endeavors and had garnered recognition for his contributions. His dedication to the art form remained firm, and as of 2013, he has consistently engaged in activities associated with tiatrs and the Tiatr Academy of Goa (TAG) whenever his schedule permits. Furthermore, Mascarenhas has showcased his artistic prowess by writing and directing three original tiatrs: Moipaxi Bhav, Bhaunnam (Feelings), and Mogak Lagon (Because of Love). These productions reflect his creative vision and have garnered acclaim within the tiatr community. During his formative years, Mascarenhas resided in the Pernem taluka, where his father, a police officer (Polícia do Estado da Índia), similar to Polícia de Segurança Pública), in the Portuguese administration, was stationed. It was during this period that Mascarenhas collaborated with local boys and girls to create his tiatr Moipaxi Bhav, a production that was well received by audiences and further solidified his passion for the art form.\nIn 1964, the theatrical production known as Moipaxi Bhav premiered in the Hamal locality. Under the direction of Mascarenhas, a cast of popular professional singers including the trio Anthony-Nelson-Conception, Sabina Fernandes, Champion Peter, and Avelino Lemos brought the performance to life. The success of Moipaxi Bhav spurred Mascarenhas to write and stage two more tiatrs Mogak Lagon, which was showcased in Baida, Pernem, and 'Bhavnnam, presented in Dandora, Cuncolim. In the same year in 1964, Mascarenhas journeyed to Bombay, where he seized an opportunity to showcase his singing prowess in Robin Vaz's tiatr, Shantichem Login (Shanti's Marriage). During his time in Bombay, Mascarenhas participated in a tiatr organized by the Cuncolim Union, with Robert Mascarenhas as the writer and John Gomes Kokoy assisting in the direction. It was during this collaboration that Mascarenhas and John Gomes formed a musical duo, captivating audiences with their performances. Their partnership endured for several projects, collaborating with popular directors such as Carmo Rod, Prem Kumar, Anthony De Sa, and Robin Vaz. After establishing his reputation in both Goa and Bombay over a number of years, Mascarenhas shifted his focus to future work opportunities. He then chose to pursue employment in Dubai in 1974 by taking the Gulf route. Even in Dubai, Mascarenhas continued to immerse himself in theatrical pursuits, ensuring his involvement in the world of tiatrs.\nMascarenhas's artistic journey in Dubai intersected with several influential figures, most notably Joe Frank and Osvi Viegas. Their paths converged during their employment in Dubai, where they discovered a shared passion for tiatr, a traditional form of Goan musical theater. Osvi Viegas was employed at the Hilton Hotel in Dubai. This encounter led to the formation of a trio, dedicated to participating in tiatr productions staged in Dubai. Mascarenhas and Joe Frank, both musicians, assumed the responsibility of composing the trios for these productions, showcasing their talent and creativity. Their collaborative efforts yielded good results and garnered acclaim. They were invited to perform a duet in the Mangalorean tiatr Munxeponn (Humanity), directed by Lawrence and accompanied by the music of Chris Perry. This performance further solidified their reputation as versatile artists. Mascarenhas's artistic endeavors expanded beyond collaborative efforts, as he actively engaged in various tiatrs during his time in Dubai. Displaying his versatility, he portrayed a Hindu character and showcased his vocal prowess in Honrad Goenkar (Honourable Goan), a tiatr by C. Alvares that was staged in Dubai. Additionally, Mascarenhas demonstrated his acting abilities in Menino de Bandar's Florian Vaz Poilo Martir (Floriano Vaz, First Martyr). His vocal contributions extended to other productions, including C. Alvares' Xezari Kombo (Neighbour's Rooster) and a tiatr staged by Aleixinho De Candolim's son Rosario, titled To Bautto Dhormancho and Mhozo Ghov Basurkar (My Husband from Basur). Driven by their creative aspirations, Mascarenhas and his associates embarked on the production of their own tiatrs. They staged two original productions: Jimmy, written by Osvi, and Gorib Ghorabo (Poor Family), penned by Joe Frank.\nMascarenhas's trio achieved significant acclaim during their career and played a prominent role in the music landscape of Dubai. Prior to their relocation, Mascarenhas had established a reputation as a preeminent Konkani solo singer before 1974, displaying vocal prowess in both solo and duet performances. However, it was upon settling in Dubai that Mascarenhas soared to new heights as a trio singer, garnering recognition. He demonstrated his lyrical prowess by composing his own songs, which contributed to his seamless performances. Mascarenhas collaborated with several Konkani stage playwrights and directors, earning their high regard and admiration. Known for his deep understanding of the early era of tiatr-a popular form of Goan musical theater he is regarded as an authoritative figure in the field, possessing a wealth of knowledge. In recognition of his contributions, Mascarenhas was selected as a distinguished tiatr personality and invited to partake in the prize distribution ceremony at the 2013 fourth Tiatr Festival, held at Ravindra Bhavan in Margao. He was subsequently honored once again as one of the senior tiatr personalities chosen to present awards at the 2015 Tiatr Academy of Goa (TAG)'s Festival of Khells, held at Ravindra Bhavan in Curchorem, Goa.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAs of 2013, Mascarenhas, due to age and health reasons, has withdrawn from the Konkani stage performances and now predominantly stays at his residence in Fatorda, Goa. He possesses a bungalow in the same area. Mascarenhas has a keen interest in collecting vintage tiatr memorabilia like old photos, handbills, awards, and other artifacts associated with tiatr. These items typically depict 20th-century Konkani tiatrists and their performances, providing insights into this traditional art form. Writer Daniel F. de Souza has acknowledged the significance of Mascarenhas' collection in preserving the heritage of Konkani tiatr. Despite his deep knowledge of tiatr, Mascarenhas is known for his reserved nature, speaking sparingly. As of 2018, he resides near JJ Costa Hospital in Fatorda, Goa.\n\n\n=== The cobra incident ===\nMascarenhas and his acquaintances embarked on a journey to Baida, a locality situated in Pernem, with the purpose of participating in a singing competition. Demonstrating his vocal prowess, Mascarenhas emerged triumphant, securing the first prize in the form of a trophy. The competition unfolded amidst a forested enclave characterized by undulating terrain. To reach the venue, known as the mattou (pandal), Mascarenhas and his companions traversed the hilly landscape on foot. Upon earning the accolade, they reconvened near the road, anticipating the arrival of their designated vehicle for transportation. While awaiting transportation, Mascarenhas, clutching his trophy, sought respite by reclining on the ground. A cobra stealthily approached him, encircling the trophy atop his chest before slithering across and proceeding towards its intended destination. Stirred from his slumber by the touch of the serpent, Mascarenhas experienced a momentary surge of panic. However, his companions promptly advised him against making any sudden movements to avoid provoking the venomous creature. Complying with their counsel, Mascarenhas remained motionless. As the cobra gracefully traversed his prone form, Mascarenhas found himself overwhelmed by an amalgamation of astonishment, terror, and paralysis.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Matthew Brown is a Texas and Hawaiian-based entrepreneur, private equity/venture investor and space enthusiast. \nHe was previously the chairman at Tamra-Tacoma Capital Partners, a $500 million fund (with investments in Urban Green Energy and Leaf Solar Power), as well as asset manager Kona Private Capital Group, a ~$900 million fund for Hawaiian residential and commercial real estate.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBrown was born in Appleton, Wisconsin. He attended Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas, but did not graduate.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBrown is the founder and chairman of Energent, L.P. and Energent Infrastructure Fund, L.P., a private equity investment management firm based in New York, New York, and is the Chairman of his family office, Matthew Brown Companies, in Long Beach, California, and Dallas, Texas. Energent's SEC registration was withdrawn in 2019. It last reported $125 million under management before going private as a family office.\nThrough Matthew Brown Companies and its investment group, Brown invests in biospace/tech, therapeutics, diagnostics and space ventures, including SpaceX and OpenAI, among others. Most recently, he was involved in the attempt to acquire Virgin Orbit Intellectual Property and intends to license it to the masses through one of his subsidiaries, Partager Aerospace, though with controversy.\nQuartz stated that Brown's business experience claims were \"questionable\" in the wake of the failed rescue of Virgin Orbit, though Brown denies the accusations.\n\nIn addition, this was not Brown's first attack on the Virgin Orbit transaction, this time criticizing the Virgin Orbit board and management on his personal LinkedIn:\"The same day Virgin Orbit announced it was pausing its operations (according to multiple media outlets), the Board approved a golden parachute severance plan for management. Given the unstable financial position of V.O. at the time, I am not certain which is more egregious: that the Board would consider such a severance plan to be proper management oversight or that Management would consider it warranted.\"Brown was a consultant to several institutions, including the University of California, Berkeley, the Texas Tech Wind Institute, the Department of Defense, among others.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBrown married Tawni Catherine Reynolds on July 23, 2017, sister to Dallas socialite Miranda Hogue, friend of Taylor Swift and Brittany Mahomes. Brown and Reynolds divorced on November 1, 2021. Brown resides in Hawaii.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Liberal–National Coalition, commonly known simply as the Coalition, is an alliance of centre-right to right-wing political parties that forms one of the two major groupings in New South Wales politics. The two partners in the Coalition are the New South Wales Liberal Party and the New South Wales National Party. Its main opponent is the New South Wales Labor Party (ALP); the two forces are often regarded as operating in a two-party system. The Coalition was last in government from 2011 to 2023. The group is led by Mark Speakman, who succeeded Dominic Perrottet after the 2023 state election.\n\n\n== Details ==\nThe two parties in the Coalition have different geographical voter bases, with the Liberals – the larger party – drawing most of their vote from urban areas and the Nationals operating almost exclusively in rural and regional areas. They occupy a broadly similar place on the right of the political spectrum.\nThe partnership between the two current parties dates back to 1946, shortly after the Liberal Party was formed, and has continued almost uninterrupted since then. The Country Party also maintained similar alliances with the Liberal Party's predecessors, the Democratic Party, the United Australia Party and Nationalist Party.\nThe Liberals and Nationals maintain separate organisational wings and separate parliamentary parties, but co-operate in various ways determined by a mixture of formal agreements and informal conventions. There is a single Coalition frontbench, both in government and in opposition, with each party receiving a proportionate number of positions.\nBy convention, the leader of the Liberal Party serves as the overall leader, serving as Premier when the Coalition is in government and leader of the opposition when the Coalition is in opposition. The leader of the National Party becomes the deputy premier during periods of Coalition government. The two parties co-operate on their election campaigns, run joint Legislative Council tickets in most states, and generally avoid running candidates against each other in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly.\nA merger of the Liberals and Nationals has been suggested on a number of occasions, but has never become a serious proposition.\n\n\n== History ==\nA Coalition between the Liberal (and predecessors) and National parties has existed without interruption in New South Wales since 1927.  Predecessors of the NSW Liberal Party, including the UAP, Nationalist Party and the Democratic Party, maintained a coalition with the Country Party (old name of National Party).\nThe Liberal Party is led by Mark Speakman and the National Party by Dugald Saunders. The Coalition won the 2011 state election in a massive swing under Barry O'Farrell, the 2015 election with a reduced majority under Mike Baird, and the 2019 election under Gladys Berejiklian. The Coalition led by Dominic Perrottet lost the 2023 state election and is in opposition since.\nNew South Wales is the only state where the non-Labor Coalition has never broken, and yet has also never merged. This remained the case even in 2011, when the Liberals won a majority in their own right but still retained the Coalition. On 10 September 2020, the Nationals threatened to move to the crossbench over a dispute regarding koala protection laws, but the issue was resolved the next day and the Nationals remained in the Coalition.\n\n\n== References ==",

On 25 October 2016, Johariah obtained her letter of credence from Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. As the newly appointed Brunei Darussalam ambassador to the Philippines, she was given an audience by Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah. She paid a courtesy call to Dato Abdul Aziz, the deputy minister of defense, on 31 October, during which the minister urged closer cooperation with the RBAF personnel stationed there and ensuring their welfare, particularly that of the members of the International Monitoring Team (IMT) stationed in Mindanao. On 6 December, she passes by the honor guards on route to Malacañang Palace to give President Rodrigo Roa Duterte her credentials.\nOn 1 December 2019, Johariah was among the Bruneian officials who attended the 30th SEA Games opening. In a reciprocal courtesy call on 15 March 2021, the assistant secretary for Asian and Pacific Affairs met with her to discuss bolstering bilateral ties, particularly in the areas of trade and investment in Mindanao and the BIMP-EAGA region, as well as defense and logistics collaboration as the larger ASEAN region continues to grapple with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn 6 June 2022, she met with President-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at his Mandaluyong offices to convey both countries' determination to strengthen ties with the Philippines under the incoming government. During an informal visit at the Department of Foreign Affairs on 22 June 2022, Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr. and Johariah reviewed the significant advancements in ties between the Philippines and Brunei over the previous several years.\n\n\n=== Ministry of Foreign Affairs ===\nWith effect from 10 August 2022, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah gave his approval for Johariah to be appointed permanent secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). The President expressed gratitude on behalf of the whole country for Brunei Darussalam's ongoing efforts to strengthen ties between the two nations. Later on 26 August, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. hosted a goodbye call for her, the departing ambassador, at the music room at Malacañang Palace.\nJohariah has represented Brunei in a number of summits and conferences since leaving her position as ambassador to the Philippines, including the ASEAN Political Security Council Meeting on 9 May 2023; co-chair of the 2nd ASEAN-UK Senior Officials’ Meeting on 8 June 2023; the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting at the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference on 14 July 2023; and co-chair of the 31st ASEAN-New Zealand Dialogue on 19 April 2024. \nAs an honorary member of the ceremony, she attended the food festival's opening in Bandar Seri Begawan on 4 August 2023, in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of ASEAN-Japan Friendship and Cooperation, which was held at the Philippine embassy. The Secretary General of the ASEAN-China Center (ACC) had a meeting with her at Brunei's MFA on 29 February 2024.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJohariah is married to Haseri bin Haji Asli, a former national sprinter who competed in the 2000 Summer Olympics. The couple has one daughter together.\n\n\n== References ==",

She is a champion for preserving Seagrass meadows which are responsible for supporting the food supply of hundreds of millions of people. In 2024 she was included as one of the BBC's 100 most influential women.\n\n\n== Life ==\nCullen-Unsworth was born in 1979.\nShe completed her doctorate in 2007 at Essex University before she went to Australia for post-doctoral research funded by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). She had taken her first degree at Newcastle University in marine biology before studying for a related masters at Bangor University.\nShe says that she and Richard Unsworth were both doing research in Indonesia focussing on mangroves and corals. She discovered that seagrasses were very important supporting life that was the main supply of protein for local families. This redicrected their research. In time one of their students, Benjamin Jones, suggested that they should found the organisation (and charity) Project Seagrass.\nShe argued in 2017 that sea-grasses may be good for supporting sea-horses but the argument was more essential that this \"fluffy\" approach suggested. Sea-grasses do support sea horses but they are important resources for the fishing industry. In 2018 she was the prime author of a paper in Science calling for action to protect seagrass. She is also quoted for noting that in the UK, seagrasses are sometimes removed from beaches so that they look more picturesque, even though they are a valuable part of the ecosystem.\n\nShe contributed to research that found that seagrasses are important for a type of gleaning i.e. \"fishing with basic gear, including bare hands, in shallow water not deeper than that one can stand\". The research was published ith an open license allowing it to be re-used without permission bubject only to attribution. Invertebrate gleaning (walking) fisheries for Invertebrates are common within intertidal seagrass meadows, contributing to the food supply of hundreds of millions of people.\nIn 2018 she was also an author of a paper which warned of the effect of environmental damage caused by British sewerage.\nIn 2024 she was identified as one of the BBC's 100 most influential women. She was Project Seagrasses' CEO. The BBC highlighted her key role in co-founding Project Seagrass and the use of underwater robots to plant seeds that can grow into new seagrass. Project Seagrass were in talks with the Welsh government who had included their work in their conservation plans.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProject Seagrass - Charity advancing the conservation of seagrass through community, research and action\nSeagrasses Project Regeneration.\nSeagrassSpotter - Citizen Science project raising awaress for seagrass meadows and mapping their locations",

        "content": "What a Way to Go is a studio album by Mark Murphy.\nWhat a Way to Go is the 28th album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. It was recorded when Murphy was 58 years old and released by the Muse label in the United States in 1990. This album is a tribute to Sammy Davis Jr. who died May 16, 1990.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the liner notes Mark Murphy wrote, \"| dedicate this record to the living memory and genius of Sammy Davis, Jr., who discovered me at the Ebony Club in Syracuse, N.Y. in 1952. And here’s a hug for Sammy's widow, Altovise\". According to Hal Webman and also to Peter Jones, Murphy mis-remembered the name of the club and also the year of the meeting: it was actually the Embassy Club on Harrison Street in Syracuse in 1953. At that meeting, Davis invited Murphy to sing with him at a nearby nightclub where Davis was appearing. The encounter led to an introduction to Stan Kenton and correspondence with Steve Allen. Five years later, after recording for Decca, Allen would have Murphy on his talk show, The Tonight Show, several times and also on his show Jazz Scene USA.\nIn letters Murphy wrote to the Mark Times fanzine he said, \"This whole thing was a chance since I did not know Larry Fallon the producer/arranger. Joe Fields insisted Larry had the sound of the 90s at his fingertips, and I listened to tape he did with Gloria Lynne that has sold well. I am here to tell you the chance paid off...The strings and horns are the best synthesized orchestra sounds I've yet heard with a singer\". He added that the album was targeted for the new-age music crowd in the USA.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nJoe Fields, founder of Muse Records, hired producer, arranger Larry Fallon, who Murphy did not know, for this recording. Fallon had previously done arrangements for Van Morrison (Astral Weeks), Nico (Chelsea Girl), Jimmy Cliff (Wonderful World, Beautiful People), the Rolling Stones (\"Gimme Shelter\"), Gil Scott-Heron (Bridges), Cy Coleman (Seesaw), and on Muse Records, Gloria Lynne (A Time for Love).\nThe supporting musicians included pianist Pat Rebillot who Murphy had worked with on Bridging a Gap (1972). The supporting band was comprised of bass, drums, percussion, saxophone and guitar in addition to piano and synthesizer. But Murphy had worked with none of them before, except Rebillot.\nThe songs included unknown compositions from June Tonkin, a Seattle pianist, Stanley Ellis, a Boston drummer, and Reuben Brown. Murphy included an original composition, \"Ding Walls\" and also wrote lyrics to Lee Morgan's \"Ceora\". \"Ding Walls\", the final track, was a Gilles Peterson tribute. Peterson was the DJ who had helped revive Murphy's career in the 80s with the Acid-Jazz crowd. The album also includes standard ballads that Murphy loved.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAndy Rowan assigns this album 4 stars in The Rolling Stone Jazz & Blues Guide. (4 stars means, \"Excellent: Four-star albums represent peak performances in an artist's career. Generally speaking, albums that are granted four or more stars constitute the best introductions to an artist's work for listeners who are curious\").\nColin Larkin assigns 3 stars to the album in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music. (3 stars means, \"Good: a record of average worth, but one that might possess considerable appeal for fans of a particular style\").\nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings assigns the album 3 stars. (3 stars means,\" A good, middleweight set; one that lacks the stature or consistency of the finest records, but which will reward the listener tuned to its merits\"). Cook and Martin write Murphy \"still sets himself the most inventive of programs - Lee Morgan's 'Ceora', Reuben Brown's 'Clown In My Window' - and makes them happen\".\nScott Yanow includes the album in his list of some of the best individual Muse sets by Mark Murphy in his book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide. \nMurphy biographer Peter Jones said the reviews to this release were \"muted\", with some reviewers criticizing the use of synthesizers.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"What a Way to Go\" (June Tonkin) – 6:09\n\"Ceora Lives\" (Lee Morgan, Mark Murphy) – 4:10\n\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\" (Jule Styne, Sammy Cahn) – 4:15\n\"Saxophone Joe\" (H.

        "content": "The trial of Kolokotronis took place in 1834. Along with Kolokotronis, his competitor, Dimitris Plapoutas was tried.\nThe causes of the trial had to do mainly with the consolidation of power in Greece as well as with the attempt to degrade the Russian party. The trial is considered a \"twisted trial\", while in historiography the facts have been distorted.\n\n\n== Causes ==\nAfter the assassination of the governor Ioannis Kapodistrias, the followers of the Russian party found themselves outside the positions of power. At the same time, Greek military corps of 10,000 people were disbanded and replaced by Bavarian mercenaries. The result was that the former Greek soldiers were led to unemployment with their consequent intense dissatisfaction, moreover some of them became robbers. Additionally, the Regents government had no members from the Russian party.\nMore broadly, however, the dispute between the military and politicians over the province of power existed since the years of the Revolution and continued in the current political situation of Greece.  Furthermore, in March 1833 the Viceroyalty prepared the ground for the autocephaly of the Greek Church by the Patriarchate, which was treated as an offensive move for the religious tradition, while some monasteries were also closed. Finally, the relatively non-conservative morality of Bavarian families was treated with caution, contributing to their alienation from the Greek people.\nThe Bavarians viewed Kolokotronis and the followers of the Russian party with suspicion from the beginning, especially after learning of the deadly conflict in Argos between the French army and Kolokotronis' Military Committee. \nAccording to Roderick Beaton, Kolokotronis had indeed incited the robbery in the countryside as well as conspired against the Bavarians. For these reasons he constituted a threat to the regime.  According to the History of the Hellenic Nation, \"for at least some of these charges Kolokotronis and Plapoutas were not completely uninvolved, such as inciting a standoff or resorting to Foreign Powers\"\n\n\n== Reasons and events ==\n\n\n==== The \"main conspiracy\" ====\nBefore Otto's arrival, Kolokotronis had sent a letter to the Russian foreign minister Karl Nesselrod indirectly asking for his intervention.\n\n\n==== The \"little conspiracy\" ====\nIn addition, a German scholar, John Franz, a friend of Josef Ludwig von Armansperg but also a close associate of the Russian party, wrote a letter to Otto's father against the two other regents to dismiss them from their positions. Kolokotronis participated in many meetings in Tripoli together with other members of the pro-Russian party, but he refused to sign the above letter of France which other members did such as his son C=Kollinos.\n\n\n==== Additional facts ====\nA fortuitous event created further suspicion when the bandit Kontavounisios killed soldiers and stole their horses. He gave one of the loot to his friend Plaputas. Plaputas then returned the horse to the army, but this created negative impressions while Plaputas was accused of having ordered the attack. In addition he had said a few phrases against the Regency.. Similar statements had also been made by his son Kolokotronis. A former soldier, Th. Alexandropoulos, constantly informed the Viceroyalty that Kolokotronis was meeting in Tripoli with a lot of people and was preparing a revolution. \nThe meetings in Tripoli were abandoned by their protagonists such as Dionysios Romas because they were afraid that they would be accused of participating in a conspiracy. Romas finally escaped to Zakynthos without being tried even though he was their first. Ioannis France had a similar fate where he was arrested to prevent his personal friend von Armansperg from being exposed and deported from the country. \nAt the beginning of September 1833, it was learned in the capital that the island of Tinos had revolted. However, the facts had been distorted as the Tinians had asked for tax reliefs and after consultations with the authorities they had stopped any of their actions. However, the event recalled the corresponding anti-Capodostrian rebellion on the island of Hydra and created disproportionate fear in the authorities.\n\n\n== The persons ==\n\n\n=== In court ===\n\n\n==== Anastasios Polyzoidis ====\nPresident of the Court of Nafplio. Fierce opponent of Kapodistrias who hailed his assassination as \"tyrannicide\". He was a close associate of Alexandros Mavrokordatos. In 1831 he was the publisher of the opposition newspaper Apollon.\n\n\n==== Edward Mason ====\nProsecutor in the trial with parallel duties of investigator. He had been the lawyer of Georgios Mavromichalis for the assassination of the governor Kapodistrias. Fanatical opponent of the Russian party. Kanellos Deligiannis, a personal enemy of Plaputos, was appointed as his assistant. They were both followers of the French party.\n\n\n==== Christodoulos Klonaris ====\nHe was the defense attorney of Plapoutas. He also indirectly defended Kolokotronis. Enemy of Kapodistrias and was a close associate of Alexandros Mavrokordatos.\n\n\n== Political contributors ==\n\n\n=== Josef Ludwig von Armansperg ===\nHe came into consultation with the ambassadors of all three Great Powers who were reacting to the executions of the accused. He convinced Carl Wilhelm von Heideck and Karl von Abel to have their executions postponed. The Greek people recognized him as \"magnanimous\" for his action in the Kolotronis trial. \n\n\n=== Georgios Psillas ===\nMinister of the Interior in the government. He was threatened with arrest by Georg Ludwig von Maurer when he retaliated against not informing the ministers of the arrests of Kolokotronis and Plapoutas. He was then expelled from the government. \n\n\n=== Konstantinos Schinas ===\nMinister of Justice. He was hated by the followers of the Russian party, because of his stance on the ecclesiastical issue (closing monasteries, etc.).\n\n\n=== Ioannis Kolettis ===\nLeader of the French party and minister of the interior. Political opponent of Kolokotronis. He tried to have the death sentences applied to the accused. \n\n\n== The trial ==\nDuring the trial, the witnesses who testified were either personal enemies of the defendants, or without prestige and wealth, so their opinion was not weighted. The prosecutors failed to bring evidence, due to the reluctance of witnesses to testify against Kolokotronis.\nThe prosecutors presented only \"random testimonies without probative value\" without any appeal to the public opinion that considered Kolokotronis and Plapoutas as heroes. Ultimately, the court sentenced the accused to death. The decision was not signed by the two judges Polyzoidis and Tertsetis. By order of the district attorney, they were physically forced to sign.\n\n\n=== After the trial ===\nThe two judges subsequently lost their jobs and were prosecuted. With these actions, the Bavarian government, in essence and in the eyes of the world, violated the laws it had established for the life of judges as well as for the freedom of the press.\n\n\n== The agreement to suspend executions ==\nOtto of Greece requested a stay of executions from the regents Georg Ludwig von Maurer and Carl Wilhelm von Heideck as a personal favor. In return, the two regents demanded the resignation of Mavrokordatos from the prime ministership as well as the prosecution of the two judges. Josef Ludwig von Armansperg accepted the terms, resulting in the sentence being commuted to twenty years in prison.\n\n\n== Concequenses ==\nA direct consequence of the stance against the execution of the accused was the resignation of Alexandros Mavrokordatos from the prime ministership and his honorary mission as ambassador to Munich. In addition, the two judges were dismissed from their jobs and prosecuted, where they were acquitted.\nA consequence of the trial was that the authority of the government was irreparably exposed. \nIn addition, the patriotism and xenophobia of the Greek society was favored. A consequence of the trial was the rebellion in Mani in August 1834 by mainly followers and associates of Kolokotronis, with the support of some members of the English party.\n\n\n== Public memory & art ==\nAristeidis Hatzis characterizes as at least childish and Manichean the interpretative schemes for the trial of Kolokotronis while he blames the distortion of the facts on the writings of Takis Kandiloros and Dimitrios Fotiadis as well as on the film The Trial of the Judges in 1974.\n\n\n== References ==",

At club level he plays as a goalkepeer with Ballyhale Shamrocks and at inter-county level with the Kilkenny senior hurling team.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMason had a number of hurling successes as a student at St Kieran's College in Kilkenny. He won two Leinster Colleges SHC titles, as well as consecutive Croke Cup titles in 2018 and 2019. Mason later lined out with University of Limerick and was part of their Fitzgibbon Cup-winning team in 2022.\nAt club level, Mason first played hurling at juvenile and underage levels with the Ballyhale Shamrocks club. He had several underage successes, including the Kilkenny MAHC title in 2016 and consecutive Kilkenny U21AHC titles in 2017 and 2018. Mason was just 17-years-old when he became the club's senior team goalkeeper. Over the course of the following few years, he won five consecutive Kilkenny SHC titles, four Leinster Club SHC titles and three All-Ireland Club SHC titles. \nMason was 16-years-old when he first played on the inter-county scene with Kilkenny as a member of the minor team.

        "content": "Federico Maria Giovanelli (also known as Ferigo Giovanelli; 1726 – 1800) was Patriarch of Venice from 1776 to his death.\n\n\n== Family ==\nFederico Maria Giovanelli was born in Venice on 29 December 1726. Third of the children of Giovanni Paolo Giovanelli and Giulia Calbo, he was descended from a patrician family from Gandino, near Bergamo, enriched thanks to the textile trade. In the mid-17th century, the Giovanelli family accumulated wealth facilitated the diversification of family activities economically, with interests in copper mines in Slovakia and Hungary and large estates in Bergamo, Veneto, Trentino and Tyrol, while some of its members pursued careers in the military field at the service of the Emperor in the fights against the Turks, earning noble titles.: 15  In the second half of the century one of the family branches settled in Venice and entered the Venetian patriciate in 1668 thanks to a donation of one hundred one thousand ducats to the Republic of Venice to support the Cretan War.: 16  Federico's father got rid of commercial activities, which did not add prestige to the noble titles, and acquired new lands. His older brothers, Giovanni Andrea and Giovanni Benedetto, educated in Bavaria, held various government positions at the service of the Venetian Republic.\n\n\n== Life ==\nDestined for the Church, Federico Maria was educated in Rome at the Jesuit college and in Brescia. In 1758, upon accession to the papacy, Pope Clement XIII, a Venetian like himself, called him to Rome as his domestic prelate and secret waiter. After Clement XIII died, he returned to Venice where the Senate elected him bishop of Chioggia on 15 April 1773, appointment confirmed by the Pope on 12 July 1773, after he had obtained on 24 May 1773 a doctorate in utroque iure at the University of Padua. The next 18 July he was consecrated bishop in Rome by Cardinal Carlo Rezzonico.\nIn January 1776, upon the death of Patriarch Giovanni Bragadin, aided by family wealth and the good reputation of his government of the diocese of Chioggia, the Venetian Senate elected him Patriarch of Venice and Primate of Dalmatia, confirmed by Pope Pius VI on next 20 May.\nDuring his patriarchate Giovanelli witnessed the fall of the Republic of Venice in May 1797, occupied by Napoleonic troops. Called to swear allegiance to the new regime, he came accompanied by the clergy and, almost blind, had the parish priest of San Bartolomeo read a diplomatic declaration inviting the people to abide by the new laws while respecting religion. After the Treaty of Campo Formio, by which Venice was dependent on Austrian monarchy, the Emperor Francis II appointed Federico Maria a secret advisor and Pope Pius VI, on the way to his captivity in France, an apostolic delegate.\nFederico Maria Giovanelli died in Venice on 10 January 1800 to apoplexy during the 1799–1800 papal conclave which had been convened in Venice. His funeral was held on 19 February in the church of San Francesco della Vigna, his state funeral was held in St Mark's Basilica on 13 March, and he was buried in the cathedral of San Pietro di Castello in Venice.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tomás Llorens i Serra (born 4 October 1936 in Almassora, Valencian Community, Spain, died 10 June 2021 in Dénia, Marina Alta, Spain), was a Spanish art and architecture historian, museum director, curator, university professor, and art critic renowned for his work on art and architecture theory and aesthetics, especially regarding the 19th and early 20th centuries. He was director of the Institut Valencià d'Art Modern in Valencia in 1986-1988, director of the Reina Sofía Museum in Madrid in 1988-1990, and director of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid in 1991-2005.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nLlorens received a degree in law from the University of Madrid in 1958 and a degree in philosophy from the University of Valencia in 1964. From 1969 to 1972 he lectured on aesthetics at the School of Architecture of Valencia. He was imprisoned and expelled under the Franco fascist regime in 1972. That same year he left Spain with his family to live in England, where he was appointed a Research Fellow at Portsmouth Polytechnic School of Architecture, at the invitation of its head of Department, Geoffrey Broadbent. He remained at Portsmouth as a senior lecturer until 1986. At Broadbent’s instigation, the school taught architectural semiotics under Llorens and his colleague Richard Bunt, resulting in various publications, notably the book they edited together, Meaning and Behaviour in the Built Environment (1980). While still at Portsmouth, Llorens was a visiting lecturer at the Barcelona School of Architecture (UPC) in 1977-1980, at University College London in 1977-1981, and at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas in 1979-1980, as well as a visiting lecturer in the history of art at the University of Girona in 1996-98. Llorens was a member of the editorial board of the Barcelona-based architectural journal Arquitecturas Bis, until it closed in 1985.\nLlorens returned permanently to Spain in 1984, settling in the Valencian Country, where he took over as general director of Artistic Heritage at the Generalitat Valenciana. On his return to Spain, Llorens was behind the modernisation of many Spanish museums, particularly after he was appointed National Director of Fine Arts in 1986 by the then Spanish Minister of Culture, Javier Solana. He was one of the promoters of the Institut Valencià d'Art Modern (IVAM), of which he was its very first director between 1986 and 1988 – his contribution being crucial for the Julio González collection to be installed permanently in the museum. He was director of the Reina Sofía Museum in Madrid from 1988 to 1990: under his direction the museum built up a rich permanent collection of 20th century art by acquiring works by the great Spanish masters such as Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris and Joan Miró, who were until then, and for historical reasons, under-represented. From the mid-eighties Llorens was part of the Spanish Ministry of Culture team that negotiated with Baron Thyssen-Bornemizsa in the transfer of his artistic collection to Madrid. In 1991 he was appointed director of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, a position he held until 2005.\nIn 2006, Llorens received the Gold Medal of Merit in the Fine Arts by the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports. In 2013 he was named Doctor Honoris Causa by the University of Alicante. On October 23, 2020, Llorens was declared the “Favorite Son of Almassora”, his hometown, by unanimous vote of the people. Llorens died in Dénia on June 10, 2021. The president of the Valencian Government, Ximo Puig, announced the news during a session at the Valencian Courts and defined Llorens as \"a great intellectual and a great Valencian\".\n\n\n== Selected edited books and writings ==\nTomás Llorens (ed.), Arquitectura, historia y teoria de los signos: Symposium organizado por la Comision de Cultura del Colegio de Arquitectos de Cataluna y Baleares, Barcelona: Gaya Ciencia, 1972.\nTomás Llorens, “Domestic characters and leap into the avant-garde”, Lotus International, No. 23, New York: Rizzoli, 1979.\nTomás Llorens, \"Notes for a Definition of Aesthetic Semiosis\", in Seymour Chatman, Umberto Eco and Jean M.

It is the first edition of the A-Leagues All Stars Women game and the fourth of the A-Leagues All Stars Game.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn March 2024, the Australian Professional Leagues (APL) announced three fixtures that would include the A-Leagues All Stars Game at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne. The inaugural A-Leagues All Stars Women team will play against Women's Super League club Arsenal, and is set to take place on 24 May 2024 after the men's game who will play Premier League club Newcastle United. It will be the first time the Arsenal women side has played in Australia. Newcastle would also play Tottenham Hotspur at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in a friendly two days before the All Stars game. The official kit partner was announced to be Kappa.\n\n\n== Squad ==\nThe A-League All Stars Women squad will consist of 19 players, with a mandatory two goalkeepers included, and is to be selected by the coaching staff. Alex Chidiac and Hannah Wilkinson were announced on 23 April 2024 as the first two players to be selected in the squad as voted by fans. \nOn 26 April, Joe Montemurro was announced as head coach, with Kat Smith and Emily Husband as assistant coaches, and Melissa Maizels appointed as goalkeeping coach.\n\n\n=== Criticism ===\nAfter the announcement of Montemurro, Lisa De Vanna criticised the decision to select a coach not employed in the A-League Women, suggesting that it is an \"insult to all the coaches who have put in the effort and remained loyal\" in Australia. Former Central Coast Mariners player Daniel McBreen supported this notion, stating that an A-League Women coach should have been \"honoured\" with the role.\n\n\n== Match ==\n\n\n=== Details ===\n\n\n== References ==",

During the reign of Shi Xie, a monk known as Kaundinya (Khâu Đà La), also called Xà Lê or Đồ Lê (闍梨) travelled to Luy Lâu (in modern-day Bắc Ninh province) to spread Buddhism there. Man Nương followed him and attended his teaching, but one day she fall asleep at the temple. When Kaundinya came back, he walked through her body. Somehow this made her pregnant with a child, and so gave the child to Kaundinya in shame. Kaundinya put the child in a tree and gave Man Nương a staff that can summon water in times of drought. One day the tree housing the child collapse due to the rain, and floated on the water. As the failed to collect the wood from the tree, they asked for Man Nương's help and she pulled the tree to the land. Inside the tree, the child has turned into a rock. Meanwhile, the wood of the tree was used to create four goddesses: Pháp Vân (法雲) of cloud; Pháp Vũ (法雨) of rain; Pháp Lôi (法雷) of thunder and Pháp Điện (法電) of lightning  - collectively known as Tứ Pháp (四法).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 7th All-Belarusian People's Assembly (Belarusian: VII Усебеларускі народны сход, romanized: VII Usiebielaruski narodny schod; Russian: VII Всебелорусское народное собрание, romanized: VII Vsebelorusskoye narodnoye sobraniye) was a convention of the All-Belarusian People's Assembly, including government officials, members of state-owned enterprises, and other individuals held from 24 to 25 April 2024 in the Palace of the Republic, Minsk. The first such conference since the 2022 Belarusian constitutional referendum that established it as the \"highest representative organ of the people's government of [...] Belarus\", media associated with the Belarusian opposition largely described it as a further consolidation of absolute power by President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe All-Belarusian People's Assembly was established in October 1996 by a presidential decree of Alexander Lukashenko. Prior to 2022 its role was exclusively advisory and it lacked significant powers.\nAs a result of the 2022 Belarusian constitutional referendum, which was internationally regarded as unfree and unfair, the All-Belarusian People's Assembly was given a constitutional role as \"the highest representative organ of the people's government of the Republic of Belarus\". According to Lukashenko's proposals after the referendum, the ABPA comprises 1,200 delegates elected to a five-year term. The Prime Minister of Belarus is required to report to the ABPA, and, at the request of the President, it can deploy the Armed Forces of Belarus abroad. It is additionally able to impeach the President and contest the results of elections.\nThe empowered ABPA has been described by independent political analysts such as Vadzim Mažejka and Arciom Šrajbman as similar to extra-parliamentary bodies in other states, such as the Politburo or Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, or the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. Pro-democracy activist Anatoly Lebedko characterised the expansion of the ABPA's authorities as consolidating a \"super-presidential republic\" around Lukashenko.\n\n\n== Assembly ==\nThe assembly began on 24 April 2024. That evening, Lukashenko was appointed as Chairman of the ABPA with all but one vote (Natalya Kochanova) in favour. Aliaksandr Kosiniec, former Chief of Staff to the President of Belarus, was selected as deputy chairman.\nThe assembly was marked by more jingoistic rhetoric on the part of Lukashenko and other delegates, urging Belarus to prepare for war. Independent analyst Valier Karbalievič claimed that this was an effort by Lukashenko to encourage the larger population to support him, threatening Belarusian involvement in the Russian invasion of Ukraine in an effort to rally the people to his side.\n\n\n=== Presidium ===\nIn addition to Lukashenko and Kosiniec, a thirteen-member presidium was selected by unanimous vote.\n\n\n== Opposition reactions ==\nPavel Latushko, head of the opposition National Anti-Crisis Management group, referred to delegates to the assembly as \"so-called delegates\", and expressed the position that the ABPA was \"a joke\". Latushko also argued that the ABPA was a \"transition of government\" leading to annexation into Russia, a view shared by Lebedko.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was written by Richman with production credits from Max Vossberg, Jonah Roy, Mannyvelli, Sparkheem and Kavi.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter having moved from his hometown Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles in 2022, Richman quickly garnered attention for his \"signature production style\" without being confined to \"genre labels\". In 2023, he was recognized by American musician Brent Faiyaz with whom he embarked on his F*ck the World that also exposed him to a larger audience. Richman was then signed to Faiyaz's label Iso Supremacy through a joint venture with Pulse Records as the first signee.\nFollowing a string of single releases under the label, Richman started teasing \"Million Dollar Baby\" on his Instagram on April 22, 2024, and posted footage of recording sessions. On April 26, he released the song, which would turn out to be his breakthrough single. Richman described the sound as \"palatable and listenable\" and referred to it as something he likes and is \"interested in\". His goal was to \"make cool shit for people\" and for him.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was ethnically Tutsi. He was educated in Gitega and in 1962 received a master's degree in psychology from Lovanium University in the Republic of the Congo.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKabugubugu served as the director general of the Ministry of Education until June 1963 when he became the minister of education. In 1965 he was made minister of information and immigration. Due to his political independence, Mwami Mwambutsa IV asked him to resign, and he was made a counselor at the Burundian embassy in Belgium. In 1966 served as an ambassador to UNESCO. He taught psychology courses at Official University of Burundi in 1967. In March 1969 he was made an assistant professor.\nDuring the Ikiza in 1972, Military Governor of Ngozi Province Joseph Bizoza had six Tutsi officials killed including Kabugubugu. Bizoza had a long-standing grudge against Kabugubugu. He later stated that he had mistaken Kabugubugu and another Tutsi official as Hutus.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\nChrétien, Jean-Pierre; Dupaquier, Jean-François (2007).

Or, The Lucky Younger Brother is a comedy from the Restoration era by Mary Pix.\n\n\n== Genesis ==\nPix wrote in her foreword, that her play was adapted from Le Chevalier a la Mode by Florent Carton Dancourt (1687). Pix's changes to several aspects of the story include substantially different characters and new dimensions in the plot. Comparing the two led McLaren to see more clearly Pix's \"comic gifts and her dramatic and moral concerns.”\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe plot combines and contrasts stories about two wealthy widows. Mrs. Rich is not an aristocrat, but whe was married to a banker. Lady Landsworth is an aristocrat and was married to a dissolute man who severely limited her freedom to leave the house. The widows are very interested in finding new husbands. Mrs. Rich want a titled spouse; Lady Landsworth wants a gentleman who is educated and interested in the arts.\nThe play is unusual for its time because it assigns an equal amount of spoken lines to men and women.\n\n\n== Notable performances ==\nJo Davies directed a production at The Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in 2016; the Royal Shakespeare Company staged a retitled version called The Fantastic Follies of Mrs. Rich in 2018.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nThe play was first published by W.

After Ptolemy II Philadelphus (308-246 BC) succeeded his father on the throne of Egypt in 283/2 BC, and considering that the work of Sopater was likely composed after Ptolemy II's victory against the Gauls in 270 BC and makes reference to him, scholars place Sopater in the last thirty years of the 4th and the first half of the 3rd century BC. He is believed to have spent a significant part of his life spent in Alexandria.\nA few of Sopater's works are known to us through Atheneus' Deipnosophistae, these are: Bacchus, Eubulotheombrutus, Pylaeus and Phacis are described in the ancient source as dramas. Other sources like the 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia Suidas count nine works in total: Hippolytus, Physiologus, Silpho, Cnidia, Nekia, Pylaeus, Orestes, Phacis and Bacchus. Sopatros, in addition to the indicative of his Paphos descent, is called a parodist and a psalicographer in Athenaeus, and a comedian in Suidas.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Jubilee Tour was the third headlining concert tour from American indie rock musician Japanese Breakfast.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn June 2021, Japanese Breakfast released their third full-length album. Two months prior, the band announced North American tour dates in support of the new album. In June 2021, the band announced new tour dates and additional dates in certain cities. In 2022, the band announced more North American tour dates, with The Linda Lindas opening, as well as dates with Yo La Tengo and dates in Asia, Europe and South America. The band originally had announced European tour dates for early 2022, but postponed them due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The shows were performed in October 2022.  In 2023, the band played a mix of headlining and festival dates across North America and Europe.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe tour received positive reviews. In The Harvard Crimson, Samantha Chung wrote, \"Zauner was completely at home on the stage, bringing her charisma and passion to the large venue. She loves to perform, and she wanted the audience to know it.\" In The Guardian, Kitty Empire wrote, \"With all this glamour flying around, it’s comforting to see that she remains so committed to her first calling. Tonight’s set is expansive, and balances heartrending songs such as In Heaven with the slow-build of Posing for Cars, a highlight of the encore that begins with Zauner performing solo, with the rest of the band filtering in to lift the track to a crescendo.\" Joshua Mellin wrote in NME, \"Watching it all unfold feels like being saddled behind the wheel of a magic school bus, staring through the windshield at a morphing visual spiralling through universes, and revving up to launch into the unknown. It’s just a shame every venue doesn’t come with it’s own trans-dimensional vehicle.\"\n\n\n== Set list ==\nThe band played these songs in Chicago, Illinois, on October 10, 2021; other shows had different set lists.\n\nPaprika\nBe Sweet\nIn Heaven\nThe Woman That Loves You\nKokomo, IN\nBallad 0 (Bumper cover)\nSavage Good Boy\nRoad Head\nHere You Come Again (Barry Mann cover)\nBoyish (Little Big League cover)\nThe Body Is A Blade\nTactics\nGlider\nPosing in Bondage\nSlide Tackle\nEverybody Wants to Love You\nPosing for Cars\nDiving Woman\n\n\n== Tour dates ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Despite its prevalence, COPD often goes undiagnosed and untreated, leading to significant health complications and reduced quality of life for those affected. To address this issue and raise awareness about COPD, the creation of World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Day presents a crucial opportunity to educate the public, support patients, and advocate for better policies and resources to combat this chronic condition.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe inaugural World COPD Day took place on November 14, 2002, initiated by GOLD in collaboration with health professionals and COPD patient groups. Since then, it has become a crucial event in the global fight against COPD. World COPD Day is observed annually on the third Wednesday of November. This global initiative aims to raise awareness about Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), its risk factors, prevention, and management. It serves as a platform for health care professionals, patient groups, and communities to come together and advocate for better lung health.\n\n\n== Objectives and Impact ==\nRaising Awareness: World COPD Day aims to raise awareness about Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) globally. It educates the public, health care professionals, and decision-makers about COPD risk factors, symptoms, and management.\nImproving Healthcare Standards: The initiative strives to improve healthcare standards for patients with COPD. By disseminating knowledge and promoting best practices, it contributes to better patient care and outcomes.\nCommunity Engagement: World COPD Day draws attention from the community, public health professionals, and policymakers. It encourages collective efforts to develop programs for early detection, prevention, and control of COPD.\n\n\n== Key Theme ==\n\n\n=== Lung Health for All ===\nThe theme for World COPD Day 2022 was “Lung Health for All”. It emphasized the global impact of major respiratory diseases, including COPD, and highlighted the effects of COVID-19, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Early detection and reducing health inequalities were key messages.\n\n\n=== Breathing Is Life - Act Earlier (2023 Theme) ===\nThe 2023 theme for World COPD Day is “Breathing is Life - Act Earlier”. This theme underscores the importance of early lung health, early diagnosis, and prompt interventions. COPD can start early in life, affecting young individuals, and identifying precursor conditions allows for timely treatment.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Max Milo Mills (August 26, 1920 – October 6, 1998) was an American lawyer and politician.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMills was a native of Marshalltown, Iowa, and could trace his ancestry to the homesteaders of Marshall County. His brother Lawrence Ferguson Mills became an art historian and professor at Central College. Max Mills attended the Washington University in St. Louis, Northwestern University, and Iowa State University before graduating from the University of Chicago. He earned a Juris Doctor from the Drake University Law School. \n\n\n== Military, legal, and public service career ==\nMills served in the United States Marine Corps from 1942 to 1946, starting from the rank of private and retiring from active duty with the rank of major. He returned to Iowa following the end of the Pacific War, and began practicing law during the ensuing decade, including a stint as Marshall County attorney. Mills also served as vice president of a travel agency, a transportation company, and was a cattle breeder.\nMills was a Republican member of the Iowa Senate from 1964 to 1968, representing the 24th and 26th districts for two years each. In 1966, Mills was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Iowa, and lost a close general election race to Robert D. Fulton. Mills again contested the Republican nomination for the same post in 1968, which was won by Roger Jepsen. Governor Robert D. Ray appointed Mills to the Iowa Crime Commission. In 1969, Mills relocated to the Kansas City metropolitan area, and later returned to serve on the Iowa Development Commission.\n\n\n== Death ==\nMills died in Marshalltown on October 6, 1998, aged 78.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2024 pro-Palestinian protests at Sciences Po was a series of pro-Palestinian protests that took place at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, commonly referred to as Sciences Po. The protest was part of a larger global movement of university protests in solidarity with Palestine, inspired by similar encampments at universities in the United States.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe protests began in response to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. Students of Sciences Po, one of France's most prestigious universities, began blocking the school's main entrance. Students showed their support for the Palestinians by chanting slogans and displaying Palestinian flags on the windows and doors of the building.\n\n\n== Events ==\nOn April 26, 2024, dozens of students blocked the entrance to a campus building in central Paris with trash, a motorcycle, pieces of metal and a wooden platform. About 40 people remained in the building overnight. The demonstration was organized by the Palestine Committee of Sciences Po, which called on the administration to cut ties with universities and companies for allegedly supporting Israel's aggression in Gaza.\n\nThe protests escalated when French police intervened to break up the demonstration. This renewed the protests, with the students resuming the demonstration after police intervention. Students continued to mobilize despite repression.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter police intervention, the pro-Palestinian students peacefully evacuated the campus building. The head of Sciences Po said that an agreement has been reached with the students. Despite the withdrawal, the students vowed to continue supporting the Palestinian movement.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMarch for the Republic and Against Antisemitism\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nike Air Ship is a basketball shoe released by Nike in 1984. The shoe is notable for being the first sneaker to ever be worn by Michael Jordan as part of his contract with Nike.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe shoes were designed by Bruce Kilgore and his next design following the Nike Air Force 1. Nike wanted the Air Ship to be a successor to the Air Force 1 and also be a team shoe that was suitable for all players. Unlike the Air Force 1, the shoe did not feature a velcro strap around the top of the shoe. It also added more color to the design by having an upper segment around the ankles and the edges around the laces in the same color as the swoosh logo with the rest of the shoe colored in black or white.\nThe shoe was set to launch in fall of 1984 and the company decided to have Michael Jordan wear the shoe while the company was still busy working on finishing his signature shoe, the Air Jordan 1.\n\n\n== NBA ban ==\nJordan made his professional debut in the NBA with a black and red colorway of the sneakers. During that time, the league had a \"uniform uniformity\" rule that stated that the shoes of a player had to match the uniform of the teams. Jordan's version of the Air Ship did not match the design of the team uniforms and both he and Nike were warned that if he did not change them then he would be fined and then eventually suspended. Nike would later use the warning and the \"banning\" of the shoes by the league to promote the Air Jordan 1 in a commercial that featured the same colorway as the Air Ship shoes that he was fined for. The promotion proved successful and led to the Air Jordan 1 becoming popular during its launch.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gangbuk B (Korean: 강북구 을) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Gangbuk District, Seoul. As of 2024, 128,295 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1996 after being reorganized from the Dobong B and Dobong C constituency.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince its establishment, Gangbuk B has always voted for members of centre-left, liberal parties to represent the constituency and is thus considered a stronghold for the Democratic Party. Cho Soon-hyung of the centrist-liberal National Congress for New Politics was the first member to represent the constituency. Cho was re-elected as a member of the liberal Millennium Democratic Party in 2000. He was succeeded by Choi Kyu-sik liberal Uri Party. Choi won re-election in the following election, securing 43.5% of the vote. Choi did not stand for re-election after he was found guilty of receiving political funds illegally. The Democratic United Party nominated Yoo Dae-woon for the constituency in the 2012 election, who went on to win the general election. Park Yong-jin was nominated as the Democratic Party's nominee for Gangbuk B in the 2016 election after defeating Yoo Dae-woon in the party's primary. Park won the general election with 51.08% of the vote. Park won re-election in 2020, widening his margin of victory by receiving 64.45% of the vote. \nAhead of the 2024 South Korean legislative election, incumbent Park Yong-jin was informed by the Democratic Party leadership that his performance in the National Assembly was evaluated as \"among the bottom 10 percent\" by the party. Park had been considered a member of the party's anti-Lee Jae-myung faction and the evaluation caused speculation that Park would be \"cut off\" from being re-nominated as the party's candidate for Gangbuk B. The Democratic Party's primary held days later saw pro-Lee Jae-myung candidate Chung Bong-ju defeat incumbent Park Yong-jin to win the party's nomination for the constituency. However Chung's nomination was cancelled after it was discovered that he had made disparaging comments about injured South Korean soldiers who had been victims of North Korean land mines in the DMZ. As a result of the nomination's cancellation, the Democratic Party held another primary between pro-Lee Jae-myung candidate Cho Su-jin and anti-Lee Jae-myung incumbent Park Yong-jin. Cho Su-jin won in a landslide against Park, receiving 69.93 of the raw vote and 80.6% of the adjusted vote. However Cho resigned as the party's nominee on March 22 after it was discovered that she had defended a sex offender that allegedly sexually assaulted a minor. The party nominated spokesperson Han Min-su on March 22 without another primary. Han Min-su won in the general election with 52.94% of the vote.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Beon 3-dong, Mia-dong, Samyang-dong, Songjung-dong, Songcheon-dong, and Samgaksan-dong.\n\n\n== List of members of the National Assembly ==\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n=== 1996 ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Majevica front or the Mt. Majevica front was one of the main campaigns during the Bosnian war with intense clashes occurring on a regular basis, the situation stayed 50/50 on the hills (and the surrounding areas) until the  1995 Dayton Agreement.\nThe Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnians wanted to control Majevica, as it had a radio tower vital for: communication, television, telephone communication’s and node radio, as this would help supply and help the Bosnian-Serb army. Holding part of the mountain held a great advantage for Both sides, as the Bosnians and Serbs could threaten their territories in North-Western Bosnia.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1991, Yugoslavia was beginning to collapse as a result of economic depression and ethnic tenesions. This soon escalated to Slovenia and Croatia declaring independence then breaking out in to a full out war. The Yugoslav People’s Army formally withdrew from Croatia in 1992, its 55,000 officers who we’re born in Bosnia were sent to serve with the Army of Republika Srpska.\nIn 1992, a independence referendum was held for Bosnia, with most of the voters wanting Bosnian independence. Prior to this Republika Srpska was formed to protect the interests of the Bosnian Serbs. Bosnia then declared its independence on March 1st, 1992 a war began between the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnians. After the Battle of Srebrenica 1992 where Serb forces and Bosnian forces clashed. Then a war derived between the Serbs and Bosniaks, ending in 1995 to the Dayton agreement.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n=== 1992 ===\n\n\n=== 1993 ===\n\n\n=== 1994 ===\nIn 1994, the ARBiH would attack the strategic radio tower on Mt. Majevica, also attempting pushing the Serbs so that they could not shell Tuzla. The attack consisted of multiple Groups and Corps. The Bosnian-Serbs deployed many units to counter-attack Bosnian forces. The ARBiH occupied “Sapna thumb”, then defending the East and north of the Radio stolice, where the 1st Majevica Brigade was garrisoned. The rest of the units were stationed around the radio stolice. The ARBiH had 8,000 troops, compared to the approximate 7,000 Bosnian-Serb troops.\nEarly winter 94\nThe Bosnian Serb army would occasionally shell the slopes of Majevica, and small clashes. But the ARBiH began to grow its forces in the region. In April Bosnian Forces attacked the Bosnian Serb army on may 11. The 2nd Corps would carry out repeated attacks on Mt. Majevica and on Banjbrdo. The 206th Mesic Brigade would see the intense fighting. The Bosnian Serb army shelled Bosnian towns and villages and began a counter-attack. Bosnian forces shelled the Radio stolice, dismantling Serbian communications and TV temporarily, but failed to capture the radio tower. The Bosnian offensive had been halted to temporarily regroup and reinforce their troops. The Bosnian assault continued on May 27 attacking their previous objectives, a Bosnian Serb unit counter attacked and pushed Bosnian forces several kilometers south. The June cease-fire saw the Bosnian Serbs drive the government gains in Majevica.\n\n\n=== 1995 ===\n\n\n== Other units that participated in the operation ==",

Whereas the alliance for 1967 Madras State Legislative Assembly election also included Praja Socialist Party, Samyukta Socialist Party, Naam Tamilar Katchi, Tamil Arasu Kazhagam and a couple of Independents.\n\n\n=== Indian General Election ===\nPost the demise of DMK Chief Minister C. N. Annadurai, senior leader and minister M. Karunanidhi assumed charge as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in 1969. He decided to form an alliance with Indian National Congress (R), Communist Party of India, Indian Union Muslim League and All India Forward Bloc for the 1971 Indian general election.\nFor the 1977 Indian general election, the party formed an alliance with Indian National Congress (Organization) and Communist Party of India (Marxist) as a part of \"Janata Alliance\". The alliance won only five seats in the election.\nFor the 1980 Indian general election, the party formed an alliance with Indian National Congress and Indian Union Muslim League as a part of \"Congress Alliance\". The alliance won 37 seats in the election.\nFor the 1984 Indian general election, the party formed an alliance with Janata Party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India and Tamil Nadu Congress Party. The alliance won only 2 seats due to a political wave in favour of demise of Indira Gandhi.\nFor the 1989 Indian general election, the party formed an alliance with Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Janata Dal. The alliance won only the Nagapattinam seat. But the new government under V. P. Singh made Murasoli Maran as a cabinet minister for Ministry of Urban Development after his nomination as a Rajya Sabha member.\nFor the 1991 Indian general election, the party continued its alliance with Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Janata Dal as a part of the National Front. The alliance lost heavily, not winning a single seat. During this election, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated, when campaigning for Margatham Chandrasekar for the Indian National Congress, in the Sriperumbudur constituency.\nFor the 1996 Indian general election, the party formed a formidable alliance with Tamil Maanila Congress, a brek away faction from Indian National Congress and Communist Party of India. The alliance bagged all the 39 seats in Tamil Nadu.\nFor the 1998 Indian general election, the party formed a formidable alliance with Tamil Maanila Congress and Communist Party of India. The alliance bagged only 9 seats in Tamil Nadu. Even though  Communist Party of India (Marxist) originally wanted to contest in support of the United Front, it decided to contest alone when only 1 seat (Coimbatore) was offered. After the fallout,  Communist Party of India (Marxist) wanted to contest 6 seats in Tamil Nadu on its own, but eventually only contested 2 seats and decided to support DMK-TMC front in the other 37 seats. This was done to keep out the possibility of any vote splitting that might result in National Democratic Alliance gaining seats.\nFor the 1999 Indian general election, the party formed a formidable alliance with Pattali Makkal Katchi, Bharatiya Janata Party, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, MGR Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, MGR Kazhagam and Tamizhaga Rajiv Congress. The alliance bagged 26 seats in the election with a large chunk of ministers from Tamil Nadu being appoined in the NDA Ministry.\nFor the 2004 Indian general election, the party formed a formidable alliance with Indian National Congress, Pattali Makkal Katchi, Indian Union Muslim League, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, Congress Jananayaka Peravai and bagged all the 39 seats.\n\n\n== Members In DMK Led-Alliance ==\n\n\n== Indian general elections ==\n\n\n=== Tamil Nadu ===\n\n\n=== Puducherry ===\n\n\n== State Legislative Assembly elections ==\n\n\n=== Tamil Nadu ===\n\n\n=== Puducherry ===\n\n\n== Dissolution ==\nThe alliance was dissolved in 2006 to form the \"Democratic Progressive Alliance\" .

Stalin.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSecular Progressive Alliance\nAIADMK-led Alliance\nUnited Progressive Alliance\nNational Democratic Alliance\nUnited Front (India)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nVolume I, 1967 Indian general election, 4th Lok Sabha\nVolume I, 1971 Indian general election, 5th Lok Sabha\nDMK on the Defensive Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 6, No. 3/5, Annual Number (Jan., 1971), pp. 189–190 Published by: Economic and Political Weekly\nVolume I, 1977 Indian general election, 6th Lok Sabha\nVolume I, 1980 Indian general election, 7th Lok Sabha\nVolume I, 1984 Indian general election, 8th Lok Sabha",

        "content": "The Children of Moses (Turkish: Musa'nın Çocukları) is a 335-page antisemitic book written by Ergün Poyraz and published in 2007, which mainly targets Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but also his wife Emine Erdoğan and the AKP.\n\n\n== Background ==\nErgün Poyraz had written many other books in the past mainly targeting Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Emine Erdoğan, but also the AKP, Abdullah Gül, Bülent Arınç, Deniz Baykal, and Fethullah Gülen, accusing them of being agents and secret Jews working for Israel or the United States with a common interest against Turkey.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book accused Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Emine Erdoğan of being Crypto-Jews working with Israeli intelligence, posing as Turks to internally destroy Turkish society by purposely increasing Islamism as a way of weakening Turkish secularism, and in turn making Turks easily vulnerable to being manipulated with religion, therefore taking control of Turkey for the sake of Israel. The book also quoted Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in various instances where he proudly declared him and his wife's non-Turkish origins, and that they do not consider themselves as Turks. Hostile statements of Erdoğan towards Turkey and its foundation were also cited. His interactions with Jewish organizations were cited as well. He was described as taking extensive measures to convince the public that he is a Muslim Turk. The United States and United Kingdom were also accused of assisting him and Israel in their work against Turkey.\n\n\n== Reception and aftermath ==\nThe book was a turning point in the career of Ergün Poyraz, who previously was never in trouble with Turkish authorities. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan took legal action against Poyraz, and won 4 thousand liras. In the verdict, Poyraz and the company which published the book were also ordered to pay a compensation of 20 thousand liras, and cease all publications of the book.\nImmediately after the release of the book, Ergün Poyraz had to go under Gendarmerie protection due to the threats he received. After an order from the Beşiktaş Chief Prosecutor's Office, the police went to his house in Ümitköy, under gendarmerie protection, and arrested him on July 27, 2007. İsmail Yıldız, who published articles against Erdoğan, was also arrested in the same week, in which Erdoğan had filed 60 separate lawsuits against Yıldız. The reason given for the arrest of Poyraz was his alleged involvement in Ergenekon, although his lawyer claimed that the arrests of Poyraz and Yıldız were part of the same operation targeting Erdoğan critics. Poyraz remained in jail, and in 2013, was sentenced to 29 years in prison, and was released in 2014.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hannah Tobey Farmer (née, Shapleigh; pen names, (Mrs.) M. G. Farmer or Mabelle; 1823-1891) was a 19th-century American philanthropist, writer, and social reformer affiliated with the abolition and women's rights movements.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHannah Tobey Shapleigh was born in Berwick, Maine, March 20, 1823. Her parents were Richard and Olive (Tobey) Shapleigh. Hannah's siblings included sisters, Mary and Elizabeth.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe married Moses Gerrish Farmer, December 25, 1844, whom she materially assisted in the development of many important discoveries and inventions. Only a few days after her marriage, Mrs. Farmer identified herself with the Antislavery Society. Her home at Dover, New Hampshire, soon became a way station of the Underground Railroad.\nUpon the breaking out of the civil war, and during its continuance, she originated and conducted a series of entertainments for the benefit of the soldiers, by which large sums of money and quantities of supplies were realized and afterwards distributed, more particularly by the treasurer of the Christian Commission. Farmer identified herself with every movement for the amelioration of the condition of the Union Army soldiers. By means of the May Day Fair which she inaugurated and superintended from her sick bed in Eden Home, Salem, Massachusetts, she was able to place US$1,200 at the disposal of the committee for the relief of the soldiers. Other fairs followed. She continued in her work to the close of the war, writing many letters to the sick in hospitals. It was her custom from the first, when she learned that regiments from Maine were to pass through Salem, to send the children with flowers and kindly messages to distribute to them as the train waited at the crossing.\n\nIn 1888, she erected in Eliot, Maine, to the memory of an infant son, Edwin Clarence Farmer (1860-1860), a large building. Rosemary Cottage afforded summer respite to mothers and children. This institution was transferred by her to the care of the City Missionary Society of Boston. In 1891, the records of Rosemary Cottage indicated that more than 1,000 guests -mothers, little children, shop girls and tired women- had received two weeks of rest and shelter at Rosemary Cottage.\nFarmer contributed prose and poetry to the general press, writing largely for the advancement of various philanthropic movements.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nThe couple two children, Edwin Clarence Farmer and Sarah Jane Farmer.\nHannah Tobey Farmer died in Eliot, Maine, June 27, 1891.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCaldwell, Augustine, The Rich Legacy: Memories of Hannah Tobey Farmer, Wife of Moses Gerrish Farmer (Boston, G.H.

        "content": "Joe Kinney is an American strongman, grip strength specialist and crush grip innovator from Bean Station, Tennessee.\nIn 1998, he became the first man to officially close the IronMind Captains of Crush No.4 gripper (165.5 kg (365 lb)/ RGC 213 of pressure) which is recognized as the pinnacle feat in world class crush grip. Despite five other men (Nathan Holle, David Morton, Tommy Heslep, Magnus Samuelsson and Carl Myerscough) have managed getting certified on this gripper since then, Kinney did it in a slow and steady paced manner that has never been replicated. \nSome of Kinney's crush grip innovations include performing extra heavy negatives (severe negatives) and wrist rolling, and training with the long handled Monster gripper, floor-model gripper and 'Secret Weapon' grip machine. He also advocated on heavy high rep squatting as a building block for hand and grip strength. \nAlong with Randall J. Strossen and Nathan Holle, Kinney co-authored Captains of Crush Grippers: What they are and how to close them.\n\n\n== External links ==\nKinney's Captains of Crush No. 4 close from 1998 – YouTube\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Zoroastrian literature is the corpus of literary texts produced within the religious tradition of Zoroastrianism. These texts span the languages of Avestan, named after the famous Zoroastrian work known as the Avesta, and Middle Persian (Pahlavi), which includes a range of Middle Persian literature.\n\n\n== Avesta ==\n\nThe Avesta is the oldest extant primary source of Zoroastrian literature, although the term \"Avesta\" designates not one text but a group of texts written in the Old Iranian language called Avestan, attested from the 2nd to 1st millennia BC. The types of manuscripts preserve Avestan texts, the oldest of which dates to the 13th century AD: those liturgical manuscripts which combine passages from various Avestan texts alongside ritual instructions in various languages such as Pahlavi, and those which simply present the text alongside a Pahlavi translation/commentary, an example of the latter being the Zend. The former category can be further subdivided into long and short liturgies.\nThe following list of manuscripts is taken from Andrés-Toledo 2015.\n\n\n=== Liturgical manuscripts ===\n\n\n==== Long liturgies ====\nYasna\nYasna ī Rapiθwin\nVīsprad\nVīdēvdād\nVīštāsp Yašt\n\n\n===== Short liturgies =====\nKhordeh Avesta\nNiyāyišn\nGāh\nĀfrīnagān\nSīh‐rōzag\nYašts (a group of 21 hymns, such as the Ohrmazd Yašt)\n\n\n=== Manuscripts companied by translations ===\nĀfrīn ī Zardušt\nAogəmadaecā\nFrahang ī ōīm\nHāδōxt Nask\nHerbedestān and Nerangestān\nNerang ī āta(x)š\nPursišnīhā\nVaēθā Nask\n\n\n== Middle Persian ==\n\nMost Sassanid (224–651 AD) and post-Sassanid Zoroastrian literature was composed in Middle Persian. These texts span four alphabets: Inscriptional Middle Persian, Book Pahlavi, Avestan (Pāzand texts), and New Persian. Literary activity in Zoroastrian Middle Persian can be divided into three phases: a Sasanian Middle Persian (3rd to 7th centuries AD), Classical Middle Persian (8th to 10th centuries), and Late MIddle Persian and Neo-Pahlavi (11th to 19th centuries).\nThe following list of texts is taken from Andrés-Toledo 2015.\n\n\n=== Sasanian Middle Persian ===\nVarious inscriptions (especially of the 3rd-century priest Kartir) and Pahlavi translations and commentaries of Avestan texts\n\n\n=== Classical Middle Persian ===\nBook of Arda Viraf\nJamasp Namag\nČīdag Andarz ī Pōryōtkēšān\nČim ī Kustīg\nDadestan-i Denig\nDādestān ī Mēnōg ī Xrad\nDenkard\nBundahishn\nMādayān ī Gizistag Abāliš\nNāmagīhā ī Manuščihr\nPahlavi Rivāyat\nRivāyat of Ādurfarrbag ī Farroxzādān\nRivāyat of Ēmēdī Ašwahištān\nŠayest-nē-šāyest\nŠkand-gumānīg Wizār\nWizidagiha-i Zadspram\nZand ī Wahman Yasn\n\n\n=== Late Middle Persian ===\nColophons\nNērangs\n\n\n=== Neo-Pahlavi ===\nLate redactions and recompositions of earlier texts\nWizirgerd ī Dēnīg\n\n\n== New Persian ==\n\nNew Persian was adopted relatively late for one or more of several possible reasons, including religious and/or conservative attachment to the use of the earlier Pahlavi, a desire to maintain distance from languages primarily or newly expressed in the Islamic world, and potential distance from the main locales where New Persian was being used. The earliest Zoroastrian work in this language come from the 13th century, after the Mongol conquest of Iran.\nThe first surviving text of this nature is the Zarātoštnāma (\"Book of Zarathustra\"), also known as the Mawlūd-e Zartošt (\"Birth of Zarathustra\"), written by Kaykāvūs ibn Kaykhosrow, although later attributed to the poet Zartošt b. Bahrām Paždū, himself the author of numerous works including the Čangranaghāčanāma. Later, the works of Zartošt ibn Bahrām Paždū would be also be written in this language. As the primary Zoroastrian language (though largely confined to the religious elite) for over seven centuries, a sizable corpus of Zoroastrian texts came to be composed in this language. An example of a late hagiography is the Māhyārnāma (\"Book of Māhyār\"). There is a genre of texts known as the Ṣaddar or 'One Hundred Gates/Subjects', four extant works exist and each engages in a discourse covering one hundred subjects related to Zoroastrianism. The oldest are the Ṣaddar Nas̱r (which deals with sin and religious ritual) and the Ṣaddar Bondaheš (which deals with eschatology, cosmography, and ritual). Later, the Ṣaddar Naẓm (written in 1495 by Mardšāh ibn Malekšāh) expanded on the Ṣaddar Nas̱r but also diverges by substituting topics related to two festivals. In 1700, it was translated by Thomas Hyde, making it among the earliest Zoroastrian texts known to Western scholars. Texts were also written into other genres including religious miscellanies, Persian revāyats, scientific and astrological texts, Zoroastrian-Muslim apologetic texts, stories of migrations to India, didactic and ethical works, devotional works, the Āẕar Kayvān, and additional works from the 18th century forwards especially in light of the introduction of printing to the regions where Zoroastrianism was present.\n\n\n== Gujarati ==\n\nEvidence of literary activity among Zoroastrians in India, in the Gujarati language, dates back to the 14th century at the earliest, although vernacular Zoroastrian texts in this language only begin to appear in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Persian centers of Zoroastrian literati had a profound impact on the Gujarati tradition of Zoroastrian writing. In the 19th century, the Parsis (Zoroastrian community of the Indian subcontinent) began to use Gujarati as their primary language of writing; the Parsis adopted the use of printing early on and so quickly came to begin publishing books, pamphlets, newspapers, and journals. The most important work for understanding the Parsi community is the Pārsi Prakāś (\"Parsi Luster\").\n\n\n== See more ==\nPazend\nZoroastrian cosmology\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nAndrés-Toledo, Miguel Ángel (2015). \"Primary Sources: Avestan and Pahlavi\".

        "content": "Raghuvanshi (or Raghvi) is a Hindu caste primarily settled in the Hoshangabad, Chhindwara, Betul, and Nagpur districts of Central Province. They are descended from a band of Raghuvanshi Rajputs of Northern India, which is said to have migrated to the Central province.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name 'Raghuvanshi' is believed to originate from Raja Raghu, the king of Ayodhya and ancestor of the revered Rama, the central figure of the Hindu religious epic, the Ramayana. Additionally, it is noted that in Nagpur, the name has been abbreviated to 'Raghvi'.\n\n\n== History ==\nA small group of Raghuvanshis is said to have migrated to Hoshangabad from Northern India, and from Hoshangabad, they spread to Chhindwara, \nBetul, and Nagpur districts. After migrating to the Central Province, Rajputs from other clans declined to give their daughters to the Raghuvanshis. As a result, the Raghuvanshis began marrying within themselves, leading to the formation of a distinct caste with multiple exogamous sections for marriage. However, this degraded their status and they were considered inferior and impure by other Rajputs. They are even considered inferior in status compared to the Raghuvanshi Rajputs of North India, who are pure-blooded Rajputs. Sir C. Elliott states, \"They are a queer class, all professing to be Rajputs from Ayodhya, though on cross-examination they are obliged to confess that they did not come here straight from Ayodhya but stopped in Bundelkhand and the Gwalior territory by the way.\" \nThe legend behind the migration of the Raghvi/Raghuvansi community is steeped in historical turmoil and resilience. According to oral tradition, a group of Raghuvansi Rajputs embarked on their journey from their ancestral homeland, prompted by the tumultuous period marked by Muslim campaigns, notably during the reign of Aurangzeb. Faced with religious persecution and the looming threat of forced conversion from Hinduism to Islam, the Raghuvansi Rajputs sought sanctuary beyond their native lands. In their quest for safety and freedom, they found refuge in the tranquil haven of Hoshangabad, fleeing from the once sacred grounds of Ayodhya. This migration was not merely a physical journey but a testament to the enduring spirit and determination of a community striving to preserve their cultural identity and beliefs amidst adversity.\n\n\n== Culture and traditions ==\nThe Raghuvanshi (Raghvi) community is divided into two subgroups known as Badafad and Chotafad. Before settling in the Nagpur district, meat and wine held significant importance in their diet. In the Saoner tahsil of Nagpur district, a revered sadhu named Bua Saheb was engaged in tapasya near the Tapni area in Katol taluka. Many members of this community were deeply influenced by this guru, leading to significant changes among them. Due to their strict adherence to abstaining from alcohol, they relinquished their swords and cutters (Katari), which they had kept out of fear of Muslim rulers. They also adopted a purely vegetarian diet, abandoning their previous non-vegetarian food habits.\nAfter the passing of Bua Saheb, the primary religious leader of the Raghvi community, his disciples engaged in disputes over religious matters. One faction sought guidance from Rao Bua Saheb, the son of the esteemed Bua Saheb, who then became the religious leader of their group. The second faction came under the influence of Dhamada Mata (also known as dhamda mata), the mother-in-law of the revered Bua Saheb. The group led by Rao Bua Saheb is known as the Badafad, while Dhamda Mata and her followers are referred to as the Chotafad. They are primarily concentrated in the Saoner and Katol tahsils of Nagpur district in Maharashtra, as well as in villages like Sausar in the Chhindwara district and the Pandhurna region. Both groups coexist in an intermingled manner, with some villages predominantly inhabited by the Badafad and others by the Chotafad. As per the records in the \"Caste and Tribes of Central Province\" book, when they achieve wealth and influence, they adopt the janeu (sacred thread), discontinue all interactions with Gurjars and Kirars (with whom they previously socialized by smoking the hookah and sharing water), and claim to be esteemed Rajputs of high caste.\n\nThe community communicates in the Raghvi dialect and employs the Devanagari script for writing. They are able to converse with outsiders in Marathi, Hindi, and English. Elderly Raghvi men attire themselves in a barakashi, dhoti, and pagri. Barakashi refers to a specific manner of draping the dhoti. Women of the community dress in a lugra (nine-yard saree) paired with a blouse. They maintain a vegetarian diet, incorporating cereals such as jowar, wheat, and rice, along with pulses like tur, moong, masoor, and chana dal. Linseed oil and groundnut oil serve as their primary cooking mediums, while they also consume ghee (clarified butter). They embrace all seasonal vegetables in their meals. Additionally, the men occasionally indulge in local liquors like mahua and deshi daru, as well as wine. Despite their previous non-vegetarian practices, they have transitioned completely to vegetarianism.\n\n\n== Sub-Clans ==\nAdingar, Arel, Bagheriya, Bader, Bahoriya, Baladiya, Balecha, Bamoriya, Barkhariya, Bijoriya, Bhaursiya, Chahaoriya, Chirentiya, Chuniya, Dandir, Devraniya, Dhamdheriya, Dingar, Dodiya, Dudiyar, Gangel, Gohiya, Hada, Hardiya, Hud, Jhara, Jhirwar, Kandoiya, Kadholiya, Kairwar, Kandh, Karaeya, Kaerya, Karanjiya, Karele, Karkuda, Karjhariya, Khadya, Khatri, Kuch, Maina, Maiyar, Maholiya, Mangraniya, Masodiya, Mathneriya, Mudyar, Nagdaeya, Nathele, Nidhoniya, Nikhar, Pachlaeya, Paloriya, Pateriya, Piriya, Raunya, Rijaudiya, Sagad, Siranjiya, Solanki, Sondiya, Songar, Sudiyad, Tateriya, Tamak, Tank, Tarvariya, Turiya. \n\nThese are the sub-clans (gotras) of the Raghuvanshi (Raghvi) caste. They only marry within these sub-clans and avoid intercaste marriages.\nMost of the people use 'Raghuvanshi' or 'Raghvi' as their surnames instead of these sub-clans (gotras).\n\n\n== Classification ==\nThe Raghuvanshi (Raghvi) caste is classified as OBC (Other backward class) in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anthony A. Olis (June 3, 1898 – August 25, 1958) was a Lithuanian American attorney and activist. He was the president of the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago from 1950 to his death.\nBorn into a family of Lithuanian entrepreneur Antanas Olšauskas, Olis studied law at the University of Chicago Law School and worked as an attorney. As a member of the Republican Party, he was elected to the board of the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago in 1946. In 1956, Chicago American praised Olis' leadership as the sanitary district reduced costs and local taxes while expanding service area and serving more people. Olis campaigned for increased water diversion from Lake Michigan into the Illinois Waterway, though such legislation was twice vetoed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\nOlis was active in the Lithuania American cultural and political life. He was a member of the Lithuanian Birutė Choir and organized various Lithuanian events, particularly concerts of classical music. In 1934, Olis was a conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra which performed Lithuanian music at the Century of Progress (Chicago World's Fair). Politically, Olis was a member of the nationalist (tautininkai) camp. After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940, he used his connections in the Republican Party to publicize the issue of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states and advocate for continued non-recognition of the occupation. Olis was chairman or vice-chairman of several Lithuanian American political organizations, including the  American Lithuanian Council.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nOlis was born on August 25, 1898, in Chicago. His father was Antanas Olšauskas (also known by his Polonized last name Olszewski) Lithuanian immigrant who founded a bank and published the Lithuanian weekly Lietuva. Olis is the shortened and Americanized surname that replaced his birth name Olszewski. His mother died when he was six years old. After graduating from the Calumet High School in 1915, he served in the United States Navy during World War I.\nHe then enrolled at the University of Chicago where he received bachelor in philosophy (Ph.B.) in 1919. He then studied at the University of Chicago Law School receiving doctor of law (JD) in 1921. He was admitted to the Illinois State Bar Association the same year. He worked at the law firms of Goss and Rooney and William Beebe. He later became a partner in Olis, Vasalle & Lapinskas.\n\n\n=== Government service ===\nOlis joined the Republican Party and was active in the 7th ward. In 1941–1946, he was a Hearing Referee with the Illinois Department of Revenue. He unsuccessfully ran in the elections for judge in the Municipal Court of Chicago in 1942 and in 1944.\nIn November 1946, he was elected to the board of the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago and became its president on December 5, 1950. He was reelected as president in 1952 and 1956 and served until his death. His work at the sanitary district was well received. In 1952, he received endorsements from all four major Chicago newspapers – Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago American, Chicago Daily News, Chicago Tribune. In 1956, Chicago American praised Olis for reducing costs and local taxes while expanding service area and serving more people. During his tenure, the sanitary district was expanded twice: by 121 square miles (310 km2) in 1955 and by 412 sq mi (1,070 km2) in 1956 for a total of 920 sq mi (2,400 km2) encompassing 106 municipalities. Olis campaigned for increased water diversion from Lake Michigan into the Illinois Waterway, though such legislation was twice vetoed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1956, the sanitary district moved to newly built headquarters that was initiated by Olis.\nDespite severe illness, Olis continued to work at the sanitary district until he entered the Albert Merritt Billings Hospital where he died a week later on June 3, 1958.\n\n\n=== Lithuanian activist ===\n\n\n==== Cultural activities ====\nOlis was particularly active among Lithuanian Americans. He spoke fluent Lithuanian even though he never visited the country. From an early age, he showed affinity for music. In 1920, he joined the Lithuanian Birutė Choir (originally established by Mikas Petrauskas). When its choirmaster Stasys Šimkus returned to Lithuania, Olis was selected as his successor. In 1923, Birutė Choir and Olis performed operetta Bailus daktaras (Lithuanian translation and adaption of The Doctor of Alcantara by Julius Eichberg). The evening generated a profit of US$2,000 (equivalent to $35,766 in 2023).\nTogether with his brother-in-law Antanas Vanagaitis, Olis organized and often performed at various Lithuanian events. He particularly liked concerts of classical music. Even though such events were usually not profitable, Vanagaitis and Olis pursued an ambitious cultural program and rented large music venues in Chicago (e.g. Stevens Hotel or Morrison Hotel). On 19 August 1934, Olis was conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra which performed Lithuanian music at the Century of Progress (Chicago World's Fair). In 1954, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Vanagaitis' public work, they organized a particularly large concert at the Civic Opera Building. It included performances by opera singer Polyna Stoska and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra directed by Vytautas Marijošius.\nOlis composed a few music scores (they remained unpublished). He also wrote the script and directed two Lithuanian movies (one of them for the 30th anniversary of Vanagaitis).\nIn 1935, Olis worked to erect a monument to Lithuanian-American aviators Steponas Darius and Stasys Girėnas in Marquette Park. In 1949–1950, Olis organized exhibitions of works by Lithuanian artists in New York, Waterbury, Boston, Detroit, and Chicago.\n\n\n==== Political activities ====\nPolitically, Olis was a member of the nationalist (tautininkai) camp – the middle road between conservative Catholics and liberal socialists. However, this camp was divided and did not have a unifying organization. The nationalists gathered around Lithuanian periodicals Margutis (published by Antanas Vanagaitis), Dirva, Sandara. Olis became more politically active after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940. He saw former President Antanas Smetona who emigrated to the United States as a key to promoting the cause of Lithuania's independence. Olis organized various events, including lectures by Smetona, promoting the cause.\nAfter World War II, Olis used his political connections within the Republican Party to publicize the issue of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states and advocate for continued non-recognition of the occupation. Olis organized two large gatherings in Washington DC on March 21–24, 1945 and November 16–17, 1945, that were attended by hundreds of politicians. Olis' speech at the gathering was added to the Congressional Record on 29 March 1945 by Senator Charles W. Tobey. In this speech, Olis demanded a free referendum in Lithuania to determine its relationship with the Soviet Union. That same year, Olis and other Lithuanian representatives traveled to the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco and presented a memorandum calling to admit Lithuania to the United Nations. In 1952, Olis worked to add the issue of Lithuania and other captive nations to the Republican electoral program.\nTo facilitate his political activities, Olis was a leader of several Lithuanian political organizations. He was chairman of the Association to Liberate Lithuania (Lietuvai vaduoti sąjunga) founded in 1941 (it later morphed into the American Lithuanian Mission). In 1949, three nationalists organizations (including the American Lithuanian Mission) united into the Lithuanian-American National Union (Amerikos lietuvių tautinė sąjunga) which was chaired by Olis until 1951. In 1948, nationalists joined the American Lithuanian Council and Olis became its vice-chairman.\nThe nationalists organized the Lithuanian National Relief Fund, which thanks to Olis' political connections, was the only Lithuanian fund registered with the National War Fund. After intense negotiations, nationalists agreed to join the United Lithuanian Relief Fund of America (established in 1944) with other Lithuanian American organizations. Olis became vice-chairmen of this united fund.\n\n\n==== Memberships ====\nOlis was a member of American Legion and various gentlemen's clubs in Chicago, including the South Shore Country Club, Union League Club of Chicago, City Club of Chicago.\nOlis was also a member of various Lithuanian American organizations. He was a founder of a local youth chapter of the Lithuanian Alliance of America (LAA). He was elected chairman of LAA's finance committee and assisted with LAA's organizational matters. He was offered chairmanship of LAA several times, but refused.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDapkutė, Daiva (2018). \"Antanas Olis: \"Aš neturėjau laimės pamatyti Lietuvos\"\".

        "content": "Aza Arnold (October 4, 1788 – 1865) was an American machinist, inventor, millowner, and patent attorney. Born in Smithfield, Rhode Island, he was trained as a machinist during his youth, and in 1809 entered work at Samuel Slater's textile manufacturing equipment plant in Pawtucket. After a failed venture in woolen blanket production and several years of employment at another Pawtucket factory, he invented a device to separate wool during carding and began to experiment with differential gear trains, possibly inventing the device independently or borrowing the concept from contemporary clockmaking. \nAfter building and operating a cotton mill in Great Falls, New Hampshire, he incorporated a differential gear train into a cotton roving frame, allowing the bobbins to progressively slow relative to the spindles, in turn producing higher-quality thread. He patented the gear train in 1823, but was unable to obtain redress for rampant patent infringements, with the technology rapidly spreading across the United States and Europe over the following years. After several years administering a manufacturing plant in North Providence, Rhode Island, he moved to Philadelphia to operate a print works. He moved to Washington, D.C., around 1850 and entered work as a patent attorney. He patented his final invention, a self-raking saw, in June 1856. He died in Washington in 1865, and was buried at a local Quaker cemetery.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nOn October 4, 1788, Aza Arnold was born in Smithfield, Rhode Island, to Benjamin Arnold and Isabel Arnold, née Green. His mother died when he was two years old. He attended school in Smithfield, but began work at a very young age. He initially trained as a carpenter, but later apprenticed as a machinist. Around 1809, he began work producing textile manufacturing equipment at Samuel Slater's plant in Pawtucket. \nHe left employment at Slater's manufacturing plant to begin producing woolen blankets. However, this proved commercially unsuccessful. In 1812, he allegedly invented a file-cutting machine, but no patent documentation is available. Sometime after 1813, he began work at Larned Pitcher and P. Hovey's textile machinery plant in Pawtucket. While at Pitcher and Hovey's factory, he developed a device to separate wool into slivers during carding. However, it is unknown if he patented the device. He moved with his family to Great Falls, New Hampshire, in 1819, where he constructed and operated a cotton mill. Several years later, he moved to North Providence, Rhode Island, where he established his own textile machinery plant.\n\n\n=== Differential gear ===\n\nIn 1818, he invented a differential gear. Around two years later, while repairing a cotton roving frame, he began to realize the differential's potential application for cotton roving. In 1822, he incorporated the differential into a roving frame, allowing the bobbins to progressively slow relative to the spindles as it filled. This produced high-quality thread which was more flexible and less prone to breaking. This gear train system was considered impressive to regional engineers, who had initially described the proposal as \"impracticable\". Although initially invented in ancient times (attested in the Chinese south-pointing chariot and the Ancient Greek Antikythera mechanism), the first modern differential gears were used by some 18th century clockmakers, with James White pioneering its first industrial usage in the 1780s in order to adjust the gap between windmill millstones in variable winds. It is unknown if either Arnold or White were aware of antecedents to their differentials in clockmaking. \nHe filed a patent for the device, dated January 21, 1823. Despite the patent, it was almost immediately plagiarized by the Lowell mill corporations. It spread across other cotton manufacturing plants, initially limited to New England. By 1825, it had been introduced to England, where a manufacturer named Houldsworth patented it. Following this, it became known as \"Houldsworth's differential\" in the United Kingdom. It was in use in Mulhouse, France, by the end of the 1820s.\nEven within the United States, many manufacturers refused to pay royalty fees for the differential gear train. Arnold filed various patent infringement suits, but was unable to obtain redress. Lowell corporate agents, attempting to defend against patent infringement suits, were unable to find precedence to differential gears' usage in cotton processing in the United Kingdom. Various reforms to the United States patent system were introduced in 1836, but did not ultimately allow Arnold to obtain redress. \n\n\n=== Later career ===\nHe moved to Philadelphia in the 1840s and began work as an operator for the Mulhausen Print Works. Around 1850, he moved to Washington, D.C., and entered work as a patent attorney. His last invention, a \"self-setting and self-raking saw for sawing machines\", was patented in June 1856.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nArnold married Abigail Dennis on July 28, 1815, and with her had nine children. He was a Quaker. Politically conservative, he strongly opposed Thomas Wilson Dorr during the Dorr Rebellion, describing the Dorrites as \"a company [raised] at New York of the liberated convicts, bartenders & radicals.\"\nHe died in Washington, D.C., in 1865, and was buried there at the Old Friends' Cemetery.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "The Source OC is a mixed-use development in Buena Park, California, primarily being used as an open-air shopping mall. Parts of the site are also being used as office space. The site opened in 2016 and is home to many Korean-owned businesses.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Source began construction in August 2012 and was developed by M+D Properties. The center was previously approved by the city, which promised to pay the developer 55% of sales tax revenue made by the project for the next 30 years, in 2010. Buena Park was chosen for its lack of large retailing centers in the area, as the nearest mall at the time, the Los Cerritos Center, was 5 mi (8.0 km) away. The mall was also seen as a comeback for the city in the entertainment sector after the closing of Movieland Wax Museum. It was built on an empty field and cost about $325 million overall. In April 2014, Korean entertainment agency YG Entertainment proposed a performance venue, recording studio, and nightclub at The Source called YG Land. This plan did not come to fruition. The construction of the mall upset many residents who lived nearby.\nThe Source opened in late 2016. Despite its high budget, the mall was not able to acquire an anchor tenant. By 2018, many stores had lost popularity and M+D Properties gained $140 million in loans. The hotel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2021. M+D Properties also announced that the mall is for sale in that same year. In 2023, some of the area surrounding The Source was designated as the Koreatown neighborhood of Buena Park.\n\n\n== Features ==\nNotable tenants at The Source include Gong Cha, Mochinut, Myungrang Hot Dog, CGV Cinemas, Covered California, Coway, Woori Bank, and Aritaum. It contains 200,000 sq ft (19,000 m2) of office space and a four-star hotel.\nThe buildings onsite were limited to 200 ft (61 m) in height to not obstruct the surrounding residential areas and planes flying to Fullerton Municipal Airport. The Source was given its name for the manmade spring that is located at the center of the site. It contains the first building in the city to have a helipad, as the seven-floor office tower reaches 107 ft (33 m), exceeding the 75 ft (23 m) requirement for helipads.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Bandle Tale: A League of Legends Story is a role-playing video game and farm life sim developed by Lazy Bear Games and published by Riot Forge. It was released on February 21, 2024, for Windows and Nintendo Switch. The game, a spin-off of League of Legends, is set in Bandle City, the home of the fictional fairy-like Yordle race, in the fictional universe of Runeterra. The player character is a custom-created Yordle who befriends characters from League of Legends as they seek to fix a malfunction causing the portals connecting each sky island of Bandle City to break. As the player progresses through the game, new parts of the city are unlocked. The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its graphics and atmosphere, but criticized the gameplay as overly repetitive.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKaan Serin of Rock Paper Shotgun called the game's pixel art \"gorgeous\", also praising the characters as \"cute enough to trigger primal cheek-squishing instincts\", but also stated that it \"unfortunately ties itself in knots with overly grindy crafting\". Cass Marshall of Polygon praised the game for its \"chill and cozy atmosphere\", saying it contrasted with League of Legends' \"high-stress experience\". Ali Jones of GamesRadar+ said that one of the best parts of the game was throwing parties for fellow Yordles, calling it \"the most unlikely of League of Legends spinoffs\". Neal Chandran of RPGFan had mixed opinions on the game, calling the graphics its \"crowning feature\", but saying it had too few musical tracks. He summed the game up as an \"overlong rough draft\", saying that parts were \"artificially padded\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Rainbow Alliance (RA) is a political alliance in Liberia. Its current constituent parties are the Victory for Change Party, True Whig Party, and Democratic Justice Party.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy June 2020, twelve political parties had signed a declaration of intent to collaborate and create a political alliance. The parties signatory to the declaration were: Victory for Change Party (VCP), Vision for Liberia Transformation (VOLT), Democratic Justice Party (DJP), Movement for Economic Empowerment (MOVEE), Grassroots Democratic Party of Liberia (GDPL), Redemption Democratic Congress (RDC), Change Democratic Action (CDA), New Liberia Party (NLP), Liberia Restoration Party (LRP), People's Unification Party (PUP), True Whig Party (TWP), and Union of Liberian Democrats (ULD). The RA was founded with the purpose of contesting the 2023 presidential election. It also sought to minimize the number of political parties in Liberia. The Collaborating Political Parties thanked the RA in its efforts toward achieving this goal. \nOn August 31, 2020, the RA was certified by the National Elections Commission (NEC), with seven constituent parties. The parties were the VCP, VOLT, DJP, MOVEE, RDC, ULD, and TWP. Leader of the TWP, Reginald B Goodridge Sr., served as the interim chairman of the alliance. Goodridge had previously served as information minister under Charles Taylor. At the time of its founding, the RA was the largest group in Liberia in terms of number of constituent political parties. The RA opposed the 2020 referendum, claiming it to be unconstitutional. The RA unsuccessfully contested the 2020 Senate elections with 10 candidates.\nIn July 2021, the RA made its framework document public. By March 2022, VOLT withdrew from the RA. By October 2022, MOVEE withdrew from the RA. In March 2022, the ULD and RDC left the alliance. The RA complained to the Board of Commissioners of the NEC that the ULD and RDC left without following the procedures for withdrawal, including paying dues. The Board of Commissioners sided with the ULD and RDC, ruling that the framework document, which superseded the RA planning document, contained no penalty for withdrawing from the RA.\nThe RA held its first national convention on October 29, 2022, in Paynesville. Interim Chairman Goodridge was elected standard bearer of the alliance. The RA did not contest the 2023 presidential election. In the 2023 Senate election, one RA candidate, Ranney B. Jackson, ran for office in Bong County unsuccessfully. The RA also contested the 2023 House elections with no victories.\n\n\n== References ==",

Three prototypes have been ordered. The first of the submarines was publicly revealed in April 2024.\n\n\n== Project history ==\nAnduril Industries signed a contract with the Royal Australian Navy and the Defence Science and Technology Group in May 2022. Under this contract the company is required to produce three prototype autonomous submarines over three years. It is intended for a design that is suitable for manufacturing to be ready by mid-2025. The submarines were named the 'Ghost Shark' in December 2022. The project forms part of initiatives to modernise the RAN. A number of other projects are also being undertaken to develop autonomous and uncrewed systems for the Australian Defence Force.\nThe first prototype Ghost Shark was publicly revealed in April 2024. At this time Anduril Australia and Defence stated that the project was running on budget and ahead of schedule. During the unveiling event Anduril's senior vice president engineering stated that trials of the type had been underway \"for some time\", though he was unable to disclose for how long.\n\n\n== Role and characteristics ==\nThe Department of Defence has stated that the Ghost Shark will provide a \"stealthy, long-range autonomous undersea warfare capability that can conduct persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike, and enhance Navy’s ability to operate with allies and partners\". Details of the submarine's characteristics and intended missions have not been publicly released as of April 2024.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFuture of the Royal Australian Navy\nRoyal Australian Navy Submarine Service\nBoeing MQ-28 Ghost Bat\nOrca (AUV)\n\n\n== References ==",

It is located 735 million light-years from the solar system.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n2MASX J09133888-1019196 has a distorted appearance due to the gravity interactions and there is a gap distance of 130,000 thousand light-years between the galaxies, meaning they are beginning to merge. 2MASX J09133888-1019196 is considered as a luminous infrared galaxy which is unusual for such early stages of interacting galaxies. It is possibly powered by starbursts with high star formation rates, exceeding 100 M⊙ yr−1, that is combined with contribution from an active galactic nucleus. It is also likely that one or both galaxies might have experienced merging or interacted in the past. Both galaxies have supermassive black holes lurking in their cores.  According to SIMBAD, 2MASX J09133888-1019196 is described as Seyfert 2 galaxy, hence its reason for having high luminosity.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Megawati binti Dato Paduka Haji Manan is a Bruneian diplomat and holding the post of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Brunei to the Philippines since 2023. Additionally, she is the alternate chair for Brunei in the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC).\n\n\n== Diplomatic career ==\nMegawati held the positions of National Coordinator for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Connectivity 2025 Masterplan, governor of Brunei Darussalam on the Asia–Europe Foundation (ASEF) board of governors, and director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department of Multilateral Cooperation. During a ceremony held in the Reception Hall of Malacañang Palace on 23 March 2023, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. accepted the credential letters from Megawati, the Ambassador of Brunei Darussalam to the Philippines.\nDuring their July 2023 discussions at Camp Aguinaldo, Gilbert Teodoro and Megawati expressed their gratitude for the close defense ties between the two countries, which were demonstrated by Delfin Lorenzana's official visit to Brunei in 2022 and the dialogue initiatives under the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting (ADMM). \nMegawati and the Bruneian delegation participated in the 3rd Joint Commission for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) held in Metro Manila on 18 August 2023. Farm Konekt announced expansion into Brunei on 23 August, aiming to aid smallholder farmers with market access while facilitating access to Brunei's halal ecosystem for the Philippines through Megawati's technical assistance and support on bilateral policies. On 6 October, the Asian Center at the University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) welcomed her in support of the university's internationalisation efforts, marking the first visit by a Bruneian ambassador to UPD and showcasing the embassy's interest in forging an institutional partnership ahead of the 40th anniversary of Brunei-Philippines diplomatic relations in 2024.\nOn 13 March 2024, Megawati threw a dinner event at the Dusit Thani Manila's Mayuree Grand Ballroom to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Brunei Darussalam's National Day. Later on 11 April, Megawati and her spouse threw a high tea celebration at the ambassador's home in honour of Eid al-Fitr. Along with partners and friends of the Bruneian embassy, the hosts were joined at the event by Robin Padilla and other envoys from different embassies were also present. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMegawati is the daughter of Koperasi Security Officer Training School's (KOPRI) CEO, Dato Paduka Haji Manan bin Osman. In 1994, she married Colonel (Retired) Rahman @ Abdul Rahman bin Haji Durahman (born 13 September 1970), former pilot in the Royal Brunei Air Force (RBAirF). They are parents to a girl and a son.\n\n\n== References ==",

He graduated from Tallinn Evening High School No. 10 (now Tallinn Adult High School) in 1969.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nHis art collection, which initially included 300 works—mainly etchings by Western European and Russian painters of the 19th century, as well as paintings, sculptures, and graphics by Estonian artists (August Weizenberg, Kristjan Raud, Eduard Wiiralt, Paul Burman, Aleksander Vardi, and Ferdi Sannamees)—was founded by his mother Selma Lepp (1911–1977). Lepp started collecting graphics in 1961, and in 1972 he started focusing on Estonian painting. The collection also includes watercolors, drawings, and sketches. He has held a series of exhibitions of his collection and published folder series, catalogs, and bibliophile publications. Lepp has also written books on botany.\nVery large collections have developed for the most important artists in the overall collection. There are over a thousand works by individual artists. Large collections by several individual artists in Lepp's collection include the works of Aleksander Vardi, Jüri Arrak, Valdur Ohakas, Olav Maran, Olga Terri, Vive Tolli, Peeter Mudist, Richard Kaljo, Felix Randel, Johannes Uiga, Johannes Saal, Elmar Kits, and Eduard Ole.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Wilson Lloyd Davis (August 5, 1917 – December 18, 2003) was an American engineer and politician.\nWilson Davis, born on August 5, 1917, in Goodrich, North Dakota, was the youngest of three sons born to James Ellsworth and Helen Wilson Davis. His eldest brother John served as Governor of North Dakota from 1957 to 1961.\nWilson Davis played football, hockey, and tennis at Bismarck Senior High School. After graduating from high school, Davis earned a dual degree in mechanical engineering and business at the University of Minnesota. He subsquently worked for Honeywell, and during World War II, was a civilian engineering adviser to the United States Navy and Army Air Forces.\nDavis met and married Minneapolis native Enid Dygert during his time in Minnesota. The couple moved to Keokuk, Iowa, in 1948.

However, a second volume published in 1906 added the Later Prophets (French: Derniers Prophètes) and the Writings (French: Hagiographes).\nThe work was undertaken under the direction of Zadoc Kahn, the Chief Rabbi of France, and several Hebraists like Lazare Isidor and Mayer Lambert.

        "content": "The 2024 Recopa Catarinense was the sixth edition of a state football \"super-cup\" tournament organized by the Federação Catarinense de Futebol (FCF). It was played in a single match between Criciúma, winner of the 2023 Campeonato Catarinense and Marcílio Dias, winner of the 2023 Copa Santa Catarina.\nThe match, held on 16 January 2024, at the Estádio Heriberto Hülse, Criciúma emerged victorious with a score of 2-0 and won their first title of the tournament.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 13 January 2018, Chapecoense, holder of the previous season's state title, faced in a friendly the winner of the Copa Santa Catarina, CA Tubarão. Later, on 14 September 2018, the FCF made the Recopa Catarinense official in the state calendar along the same lines. At the time, the entity planned to hold the tournament in January, but the 2019 Copa América made it impossible to hold the match in that month. Until the edition in question, Figueirense and Brusque have won two titles, while Avaí and Joinville have won the tournament once.\n\n\n== Match ==\n\nThe match took place at 9:30 pm on Tuesday, January 16, 2024, at the Estádio Heriberto Hülse, in Criciúma. The attendance was 10,037 people. The refereeing quartet was made up of Gustavo Ervino Bauermann, assisted by assistants Kléber Lúcio Gil and Fabiano Coelho da Silva. Luiz Augusto Silveira Tisne acted as fourth referee. For this edition, there were tributes to Zagallo, including the trophy, named Mário Jorge Lobo Zagallo. The transmission took place through SporTV and Premiere.\nAfter piling up opportunities and forcing goalkeeper Belliato to work hard, Criciúma managed to score the first after a low cross from Eder to Felipe Vizeu, who finished practically with an empty net in the 31st minute. Eight minutes later, it was Eder's turn to appear free inside the small area to extend the score and make Tigre go to the dressing room more calmly. At half-time, the experienced striker revealed that he promised coach Cláudio Tencati that he would return to analyze his physical form and the possibility of playing in the Recopa Catarinense final. Criciúma came back from the locker room looking for the third and almost managed it after Fellipe Mateus took advantage of the opportunity from a corner kick, but Belliato, once again, appeared to save Marinheiro. On the other hand, Marcílio Dias tried to react after substitutions and ended up finishing with defender Silvio, but goalkeeper Gustavo appeared to make a good save. However, the Mario Jorge Lobo Zagallo trophy went to Criciúma, which guarantees the unprecedented Recopa Catarinense title.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "On June 30, 1973, the supersonic jet Concorde 001 intercepted the path of a total solar eclipse and followed the moon's shadow across Africa. This feat allowed the passengers to experience a total solar eclipse for 74 minutes, the longest total eclipse observation. Five experiments were carried out during the flight, but they have had limited scientific impact.\n\n\n== Sequence of events ==\n\n\n=== Preparation and lead up ===\nIn May 1972, Pierre Léna, an astronomer from the Paris Observatory, proposed his idea to view the 1973 eclipse from an aircraft to André Turcat, a French test pilot who worked with Concorde, over lunch at a restaurant inside Toulouse Airport. Léna describes this meeting in his book about the 1973 flight, Concorde 001 et l’ombre de la Lune (2015), while Turcat describes it in Un mythe éclipsé in Bulletin de l’Académie des sciences, agriculture, arts et belles lettres d’Aix-en-Provence (2013). British astrophysicist, John Beckman, had previously tried to obtain permission to use the 002 Concorde prototype to conduct a similar experiment, but was turned down.\nIn autumn 1972, Léna was told that he, Turcat, and their teams could begin work, but that no firm decision would be made about the flight before February 1973. On February 2, it was announced that the flight would proceed. The scientists were able to carry out a test flight with their equipment on May 17, 1973, in their maiden supersonic flight. The final 2 hour and 36 minute rehearsal flight took place on June 28.\n\n\n=== June 30, 1973 ===\n\nAt 10:08 GMT on June 30, 1973, Concorde 001 departed Las Palmas, Gran Canaria in the Spanish Canary Islands piloted by André Turcat and Jean Dabo. Aboard the flight were Turcat and Dabo; flight mechanic Michel Rétif; radio navigator Hubert Guyonnet; Henri Perrier; and astronomers Léna, Beckman, Donald Hall, Donald Liebenberg, Alain Soufflot, Paul Wraight, and Serge Koutchmy.\nThe plane intercepted the path of totality over Mauritania within 1 second accuracy of the planned rendezvous and flew at an altitude of 58,000 feet at Mach 2. Mauritania had agreed to close its airspace to commercial air traffic to ensure the success of the Concorde's flight. The aircraft flew in the lunar shadow over the Sahara including Mali, Nigeria, and Niger, before landing in Fort-Lamy (present-day N'Djamena), Chad.\nOn the ground on Earth, the longest possible viewing of totality from a fixed location was 7 minutes and 4 seconds. The Concorde experienced 74 minutes of totality with an extended second contact of 7 minutes and extended third contact of 12 minutes.\n\n\n== Aircraft ==\nThe original Concorde prototype 001 made its first test flight in 1969 from Toulouse Airport. The specific modified version of the aircraft used for this experiment was the Concorde 001F-WTS. The aircraft has four twin-spool Olympus 593 engines and two onboard inertial guidance systems. Four specially-made portholes were installed in the roof of the aircraft's fuselage to facilitate viewing of the sun. Infrared and optical cameras were installed in roof portholes to capture the sun's corona with little atmospheric interference.\nThe Concorde 001F-WTS is now kept as a permanent exhibit at the Musée de l’air et de l’espace in France.\n\n\n== Scientific observations ==\nFive experiments were carried out during the 1973 Concorde 001 flight. Léna and his team (Université Paris) focused their efforts on studying the F-corona (dust particles left over from comets in the sun's corona). Wraight (University of Aberdeen) used a side-porthole to watch the effects of the eclipse on oxygen atoms in the Earth's atmosphere. Liebenberg (University of California, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories) measured pulsations in light intensity, while Beckman (Queen Mary College) observed the far infrared emissions from the chromosphere.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThough this event garnered wide and lasting media attention, solar researchers are generally in agreement that the Concorde's flight has had limited scientific impact. Kevin Reardon of the National Solar Observatory said of the flight, \"Strangely no significant results were ever published from the effort. [...] The overall science output was not as notable as the flight itself.\" Léna himself has admitted, \"The five experiments all succeeded, but none of them revolutionized our understanding of the corona\" and that \"[the experiments] all played their role in the normal progression of scientific knowledge, but there were no extraordinary results.\"\nOn August 11, 1999, three Concorde aircraft — one from France and two from the United Kingdom — carried out a similar feat carrying tourists instead of scientists. Passengers paid $2,400, but experienced only four or five minutes of totality, which was difficult to see because of the small windows and the sun's height. A similar flight was planned for the June 21, 2001 solar eclipse, but was canceled after the 2000 plane crash of Air France Flight 4590. Airborne eclipse chasing has been successfully attempted on other non-supersonic airliners including the LATAM Airlines Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner (E-Flight 2019-MAX), and the 2024 Gulfstream V jet.\nThe Concorde's 74 minutes of totality remains the longest total eclipse observation.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A reversible poem, also called a palindrome poem or a reverso poem, is a poem that can be read both forwards and backwards, with a different meaning in each direction, like this:\n\nReversible poems, called hui-wen shih poems, were a Classical Chinese artform.  The most famous poet using this style was the 4th-century poet Su Hui, who wrote an untitled poem now called \"Star Gauge\" (Chinese: 璇璣圖; pinyin:  xuán jī tú).  This poem contains 841 characters in a square grid that can be read backwards, forwards, and diagonally, with new and sometimes contradictory meanings in each direction.  Reversible poems in Chinese may depend not only on the words themselves, but also on the tone to produce a sense of poetry.  Beginning in the 1920s, punctuation (which is uncommon in Chinese) was sometimes added to clarify Chinese palindromic poems.\nEnglish-speaking poets such as Marilyn Singer and Brian Bilston have also published reversible poems.  Reversible poems have also been written in Hebrew.\nReversible poems are sometimes taught to students as a way of showing differing perspectives within the same words.  In English, omitting punctuation and placing line breaks strategically are useful writing techniques for creating a reversible poem.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Bratton (1742 – February 9, 1815) was an American patriot during the Revolutionary War. He led the patriots in an ambush against Captain Christian Huck and the British and loyalist forces at Huck's Defeat. Huck was killed, Bratton was victorious, and he learned that guerilla warfare helped the South Carolina patriot militia win the Battles of Kings Mountain (October 7, 1780) and Cowpens (January 17, 1781).\nThe Bratton's house, a girl's school after Bratton's death, is one of the properties of the Brattonsville Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nWilliam Bratton was born in County Antrim, Northern Ireland in 1742. Bratton's family immigrated to the American colonies when he was young. His family moved to South Carolina in the 1760s, having lived in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina before that, according to family tradition.\nBratton married Martha Robertson or Robinson in Rowan County, North Carolina in 1765. Martha was born in Rowan County in 1750. \nBratton and Martha had eight children. Their daughters include Mary, Jean, Martha Foster, Ealie (Elsie) Sadler, Agnes McCaw, and Elizabeth Gavine, and their sons John S. and William Bratton. Their daughter Alise (Elsie) was born in 1766 and son William was born in 1774 in York, South Carolina. \nThe Brattons settled on the South Fork of Fishing Creek, with a two-story house built on 200 acres of land that was purchased in 1766. Their house, a property of the Brattonsville Historic District, is a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== Revolutionary war ==\nBratton, initially a captain and ultimately a colonel in the South Carolina militia. By 1780, he served under General Thomas Sumter. After the Siege of Charleston, the British won most of the battles. He fought at Huck's Defeat, changing the patroit's military tactics and the course of the war in South Carolina.\nIn June 1780, the British questioned Martha as to her husband's location. She refused to reveal his position, even as a British soldier held a reaping-hook at her throat. That night, Watt, an enslaved family servant, she sent a message to Bratton about where the British were staying, prompting a surprise attack by the patriots. The battlefield included his home. The victorious patriots housed a number of captured British soldiers in the Bratton home. Martha nursed the wounded American and British soldiers.\nAbout 133 men who served under William Hill, Edward Lacey, John McClure, and Bratton readied themselves for battle early in the morning of July 12, 1780. They were near Bratton's house at the plantation of James Williamson, called Williamson's Plantation. Bratton led the patriots in the attack against Captain Christian Huck of the British Legion in the conflict called Huck's Defeat. About 120 Loyalist militia and British soldiers were defeated in what is also called the Battle of Williamson's Plantation. Huck was killed.\nWith this fight, the patriots learned that they did not have to arrange themselves in rows, face their enemy, and shoot at them, while they were fired upon. Instead, guerrilla warfare was much more effective, particularly if they were outnumbered. This approach and the morale boost helped them win the Battles of Kings Mountain (October 7, 1780) and Cowpens (January 17, 1781).  Bratton served until the end of the war.\n\n\n== Legislator and other occupations ==\nBratton served both the State House of Representatives, starting in 1785, and the State Senate, from 1791 and into 1794. He was also the Pinckney District sheriff and a York County justice of the peace. He was also a planter, businessman, and merchant. He owned enslaved servants.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nWilliam died on February 9, 1815 and Martha a year later. They both died in York, South Carolina, in what is now Brattonsville, South Carolina. Brattonsville, South Carolina was named after the couple.\nAfter Martha's death, their son inherited their home and later converted it into a school for girls. In her will, Martha named 48 enslaved people.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Friedrich Ackermann (25 December 1866 – 9 April 1931) was a politician and jurist, who from 1907 to 1931, was the high mayor of Szczecin, Poland (then part of Germany).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFriedrich Ackermann was born on 25 December 1866 in Bądle, a village then in the Province of Prussia, Kingdom of Prussia, and now located within the Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship, Poland. He came from a family of civil servants from Mecklenburg, and was related via marriage to the merchant families in Gdańsk. His father was Friedrich Ackermann, an estate owner, and his mother was Johanna Ackermann (née Steffens).\nHe was taught by private tutors, and later attended upper classes a gymnasium in Jelenia Góra, from which he graduated in 1885. At first he studied natural science in Zürich, Switzerland, and from 1886, he studied law in Munich, Leipzig, and Göttingen, and graduated with a doctorate in jurisprudence.\nAfter graduation, he did a military service for a year, and became judicial trainee in 1890, and a judicial assessor in West Prussia in 1885. In 1896, he became a councillor in Gdańsk, and in 1907 he was a mayor of Rathenow for three months.\n\nOn 1 April 1907 he became the high mayor of Szczecin, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire (now part of Poland). He held the office for over 23 years, until his death in 1931. During this time he strove to maintain the city's high position, and develop new areas. He had modernised the seaport and transport network. The city also expanded incorporating modern neighbourhoods of Pogodno, Świerczewo, and northern Niebuszewo, and in Pogodno was developed a residencial estate of villas, nicknamed Ackermannshöhe in recognition of the mayor's efforts. Under his administration were also opened the Haken Tarrace (now Chrobry Embankment), Quistorp Park (now Kasprowicz Park), Central Cemetery, and the City Museum (its building now serving as headquarters of the Szczecin National Museum.\nAs the mayor, he represented the city in the Prussian House of Lords from 1907 to 1918. He was also a long-standing member of the Provincial Parliament of the Province of Pomerania from 1910 to 1931. There, from 1910 to 1920 he was a representative of the city of Szczecin, and following the change in the electoral law in 1921, he was a member from the list of the German People's Party. From 1910 to 1920 and from 1926 to 1929, he held the office of the parliamentary deputy chairperson, and from 1930 to 1931, a second deputy chairperson.\nAckermann died on 9 April 1931 in Szczecin, and was buried at the Central Cemetery. His grave did not survive to the present day. On 18 April 1931, he was posthumously given the title of the honorary citizen of the city.\n\n\n== Private life ==\nAckermann was married twice, to Gertruda Ackermann, and Helena Ackermann. He had four children from his first marriage, and five from the second.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nIn 2001 a garden square in Szczecin at the intersection of Mikołaja Kopernika Street and Bolesława Krzywoustego Street, was named the Friedrich Ackermann Square (Polish: skwer Friedricha Ackermanna). A part of the modern neighbourhood of Łękno, which was developed under his administration, was in the past called Ackermannshöhe (from German: Ackermann Hill).\nIn 2000, he was placed third on the Szczecin inhabitants of the century, a list that included the 79 most outstanding inhabitants of the city in years 1900–2000, based on the referendum organized by the Szczecin edition of Gazeta Wyborcza, Polish Radio Szczecin, and TVP3 Szczecin. He received 4102 votes, and placed after Hermann Haken, and Piotr Zaremba.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Compendium of the Christian Doctrine in the Portuguese and Brasílica Language (Portuguese: Compêndio da doutrina cristã na língua portuguesa e brasílica) is a catechism by John Philip Bettendorff, published in 1687 in the city of Lisbon. It was the last book on the Old Tupi language printed by the Society of Jesus in the Brazilian colonial period and the first whose author was an active Jesuit in the Amazon. It had a second edition printed in 1800, reissued also in Lisbon by José Mariano da Conceição Veloso.\nIt is sometimes regarded as the most inaccessible of the Tupi works printed by the Jesuits in the 16th and 17th centuries; the only Tupinologist who had access to the first edition was Antônio Lemos Barbosa. Two copies of this first edition are known, one in the National Library Foundation of Rio de Janeiro and another in the National Library of Spain.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Compendium of the Christian Doctrine in the Portuguese and Brasílica Language at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Glaumbær is a town and church site in the middle of Langholt, west of Héraðsvötn in Skagafjörður, formerly a part of the rural municipality Seyluhreppur. It is now home to the Skagafjörður Folk Museum.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Glaumbær settlement has been inhabited since the beginning of Iceland's history. The explorer Þorfinnur Karlsefni and his wife, Guðríður Þorbjarnardóttir, lived in Reynistaður before they came from Vinland and bought the land that became Glaumbær. In the 11th century, their son, Snorri Þorfinnsson, who was said to have been born in Vinland, lived there. In the Saga of the Greenlanders, it says that he had the first church built in Glaumbær while his mother Guðríður traveled south. The church at Glaumbær was dedicated to John the Baptist during the Catholic era. The Saga says that Guðríður became the anchoress of Glaumbær after she returned from her trip to the south.\nMany well-known leaders lived in Glaumbær during this era. Among them was the local magistrate Hrafn Oddsson, his son Jón \"Korpur\" (Jón the Raven) and his grandson Hrafn (Rafn) Jónsson, known as Hrafn of Glaumbær (the Raven of Glaumbær). Hrafn invited 360 people to his daughter's wedding reception in Glaumbær in 1360. Soffía, the daughter of Loftur \"ríki\" Guttormsson (Loftur the Rich), and her son Þorleifur Árnason lived in Glaumbær. His son, Teitur \"ríki\" Þorleifsson (Teitur the Rich) (died 1537), had many disputes with Gottskálk \"grimmi\" Nikulásson (Gottskálk the Cruel), the bishop of Hólar, and many chieftains in the earlier part of the 16th century to whom he lost almost all his wealth and power.\nArchaeologists in Glaumbær have uncovered remnants of pavilions in the wedding grounds.\n\n\n== Priests and the Church ==\nAccording to the Catholic church's cartularies, there were two priests in Glaumbær, the household priest and the vicar. A short while before the Reformation, Jón Arason granted the land to Hólastóll and made it into a rectory; priests have been in Glaumbær since. Glaumbær was long considered to be the best paying position in the priesthood in Skagafjörður and many priests served there for a long time. One of the best known is Gottskálk Jónsson (1524–1590), who served as the priest in Glaumbær from 1554 on. He was a scholar and his writings include the Gottskálk Annals and Sópdyngja, which is one of the oldest and most significant pieces of Icelandic writing. Another of Glaumbær's well-known priests was Grímúlfur Illugason (1697–1784), who served there from 1727 until he died. He was known to be skilled in magic and there are various folk tales surrounding him.\nGlaumbær's present church was built in 1926 after the wooden church building that was there was destroyed in a ferocious storm. The new church's walls have panels made from the pulpit that was thought to be built in 1685. The pulpit was sold at auction in 1930 and its panels were used as a weight for hay for some years before they were salvaged.\nGlaumbær's churchyard houses Miklabæjar-Solveig's grave; her bones were buried there until 1937.\n\n\n== Skagafjörður Folk Museum ==\nThe Skagafjörður Folk Museum, which acquired the Glaumbær turf houses, was founded on May 29, 1948 and opened its doors on June 15, 1952. The museum's turf houses contain many items; most are tools related to domestic life and techniques used in an earlier era. The complex consists of thirteen turf houses, six with front-facing gables. The site is unique among Icelandic turf farms insofar as very small stones are used in the walls in a way that is rarely found in the municipality of Glaumbær.\nTwo old wooden houses have been moved to museum site in Glaumbær. Áshús is from Ás in Hegranes. It was built between 1884–1886 to house Skagafjörður's women's school. It never fulfilled its original purpose and was used as a residence until 1977. It was then relocated to Glaumbær in 1991. The house is now a coffee shop, exhibit, and storage area. Gilsstofa was originally built in Espihóll in Eyjafjörður in 1849. It was taken down in 1861 and moved to Akureyri. From there it was transported by boat to Kolkuós, re-built in Hjaltastaðir in Blönduhlíð, moved to Reynistaður in 1872, to Gil in Borgarsveit in 1884, and finally to Sauðárkrókur in 1891 where it stood until 1985 when it was moved to Kringlumýri in Blönduhlíð. It stayed there until 1996 and was reconstructed there to be as close to the original as possible, but little was left of the original wood after its many relocations. It now contains the museum shop and office, plus an area for the staff.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\tGlaumbær\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Leo Wringer is a British Shakespearean actor who has also performed in many television and film roles.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWringer was born in Spanish Town, Jamaica to Aston Charles Wringer and Cynthia Wringer. The family lived in Tottenham. He was schooled in England. He went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He graduated in 1978 and was awarded the Shakespeare Prize. \n\n\n== Shakespeare ==\nWringer understudied Paul Rhys as Hamlet and performed in this role at the Globe Theater in Tokyo in 1999. He has performed in over 26 Shakespearean productions playing roles from Puck to Rosencrantz to Brutus to Othello. He occasionally plays these roles with a Jamaican or \"broad Carribean\" accent, contrasting the classic characters with more modern-sounding dialogue.\nIn 2018 he performed in The Fantastic Follies of Mrs Rich, an adaptation by the Royal Shakespeare Company of the 18th-century comedy The Beau Deceived. Daily Mail columnist Quentin Letts suggested that Wringer was miscast as the nobleman and criticized what he called the company's \"clunking approach to politically correct casting.\" The Company responded condemning Letts for his \"ugly and prejudiced commentary.\" Wringer was supported in social media and by colleagues both for that specific performance but also his lengthy and impressive stage CV. Wringer responded with an essay in the Sunday Times headlined \"And why shouldn’t I play a country squire?\" calling Letts' comments \"an unforgiveable racial slur against me and my fellow actors of colour.\"\nWhen asked about the concept of colorblind casting, Wringer replied, \"I am on the side of the argument that says colourblind casting is another, albeit a subtle, form of suppression of our dreams and stories... Until more institutions and artistic organisations join in the work, already underway, to put Black talent in positions where they can create their own stories of how we got dislocated from our roots, the emphasis should be instead on colour-conscious casting.\"\nWringer teaches Shakespeare in Performance at the British American Drama Academy.\n\n\n== Other credits ==\nWringer won a Time Out Award with Colin McFarlane for Best Actor in Two Horseman in 1994. His television credits include The Moonstone, Silent Witness, and Gangsta Granny. His film credits include The Changeling, The Kitchen Toto and Max Loves Alice. He played the role of Marvin Gaye senior in Royal & Derngate theatre's dramatization of Gaye's life, called Soul. \nHe teaches at the British American Drama Academy's London Theatre Program, working there in the Greek Theatre, London Theatre, and Midsummer in Oxford programs.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "=== The corn island boa (scientific name Boa constrictor imperator),known on the corn island  \"Woula\", is a species of dwarf, non-venomous, heavy-bodied snake that is very unique and only naturally found on the corn island.The boa constrictor is a member of the family Boidae. The species is native to tropical South America. A staple of private collections and public displays, its color pattern is highly variable yet distinctive.\n\n\n=== Description ===\nWhile boas are generally known for their large size, the Corn Island Boa is an exception. These boas are relatively small, with adults typically reaching lengths between 4 to 5 feet. Their smaller size makes them more manageable for snake enthusiasts who prefer to keep them as pets.\nThey are known for their striking red undersides and flanks. They typically have a nice olive green to tan body color as well and can range from darker and contrasting to much paler examples. The boa colony preserved in culture typically has rather pale tail blotches with very diffused edges. The dorsal saddles on the rest of the snake are also few in number and typically quite faded and pale in comparison to other Central American Boa whom are known for their large number of dark and often well connected dorsal saddles. These are truly a unique race of boa constrictor from Central America.\n\n\n=== Distribution and habitat ===\nThe corn island boas are unique to corn island,The islands are covered with white sand and Coconut Palms creating a small Jungle like affect. Like most Islands in the Caribbean.\n\n\n=== Hunting ===\nThe Corn Island Boa is predominantly a nocturnal species, meaning they are most active during the night. This behavior allows them to avoid the scorching heat of the day and increases their chances of successfully hunting for prey in the darkness. Like many other boas, the Corn Island Boa is an ambush predator. They patiently wait for their prey to come within striking distance before attacking. Their powerful bodies and strong jaws allow them to constrict their prey, typically small mammals, birds, and reptiles, until they are immobile.\n\n\n== References ==\nhttps://tcreptile.com/corn-island-boas/\nhttps://www.boa-constrictors.com/en/boa_constrictor_imperator_corn_island",

        "content": "Ula Sharon Robinson Bergfeldt (March 17, 1905 – January 19, 1993), known professionally as Ula Sharon, was an American dancer. She danced in shows on the Broadway and London stages, and was founder and artistic director of the Kansas City Dance Theater. She was co-founder of the Vedanta Society of Kansas City.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nUla Robinson was born in Spring Hill, Kansas, the daughter of John Mason Robinson and Lilleth Sharon Robinson. Her father was a civil engineer. In 1916, young Robinson toured Australia as a vaudeville performer, accompanied by her parents. \n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile still in her teens, Sharon made her New York debut in May 1920, in a ballet recital at Aeolian Hall. \"A bit too heavy, a lack of grace, but great agility of toe manipulation\" were the observations of one critic at her debut. But another publication noted that she was \"a real dancer, not an improvising amateur, overburdened with 'original' interpretive ideas.\" Because she was so young, a guardian was appointed, to allow her to sign contracts for her work.\nSharon danced in several Broadway shows, including Broadway Brevities of 1920, The Greenwich Village Follies (1922, 1923), Music Box Revue (1924), Song of the Flame (1925), and She's My Baby (1928). She was also in London productions of Sunny (1926) and Friml's The Three Musketeers (1930). Fellow dancer Ruth Page described Sharon's skills en pointe: \"Ula Sharon would hop for what seemed like a half hour on one toe—you could shut your eyes and take a little rest and when you opened them there was Ula still hopping.\" \nIn 1921, Sharon was featured on the cover of The Tatler, and she drove a battery-powered car, billed as \"The Smallest Automobile\". She endorsed a \"nerve tonic\", Phosferine, in print advertisements. \nLater in life, Sharon taught dance classes at her own studio in Kansas City. In 1954 she was co-founder and first artistic director of the Kansas City Dance Theater. She was co-founder of the Vedanta Society of Kansas City. She and her husband were followers of Swami Satprakashananda, head of the Vedanta Society of St. Louis, and hosted Vedanta Society meetings in their home.  \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSharon married her dancing partner, Carl Randall, in 1924; they divorced in 1928. She later married businessman William Harold (\"Perky\") Bergfeldt. They had a son, William. Her husband died in 1971, and she died in 1993, in Kansas City, Missouri, at the age of 87. There is a collection of her papers in the State Historical Society of Missouri.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUla Sharon at IMDb\nUla Sharon at the Internet Broadway Database\n\"Ula Sharon Dancing on the Beach\" (1922), a photograph at Getty Images\n\"Dancer Ula Sharon with a model dove\" (1927), a photograph at Getty Images",

Made his professional wrestling debut in 1952 in Texas. His wrestling gimmick was a ballet dancer where he did acrobatic moves in the ring. Starr popularized the airplane spin as his finisher, a move which called upon his ballet background to execute perfectly.  \nFrom 1957 to 1962, Starr worked in New York City for Capitol Wrestling Corporation.  \nIn 1962, he made his first trip to England.    \nLater in his career, he wrestled in Mexico, France, Germany and Austria. \n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nAfter retiring from wrestling in 1977, Starr resided in London until his death. \nStarr was considered to be one of the first openly homosexual wrestlers.  \nOn September 20, 2014, Starr passed away at the age of 83.  \n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\nDallas Wrestling Club / Southwest Sports, Inc.\nNWA Texas Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Ray Gunkel (2)\nNWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Ciclón Negro\nPacific Northwest Wrestling\nNWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Pepper Gomez\nNWA Western States Sports\nNWA Western States Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Lord Alfred Hayes (1)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRicki Starr at OWW.com\nat IMDb\nat ProFightDB\nThe Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: Heroes and Icons",

        "content": "Glaucotrema is a genus of lichen-forming fungi in the family Graphidaceae. It has five species.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe genus was circumscribed in 2012 by the lichenologists Eimy Rivas Plata and Helge Thorsten Lumbsch, with Glaucotrema glaucophaenum assigned as the type species. This lichen was originally described as a species of Thelotrema by August von Krempelhuber in 1875, and was later classified in the genus Myriotrema. The genus name merges the suffix -trema with a portion of the epithet from its type species, glaucophaenum.\nOriginally, Glaucotrema was proposed to contain the type and one other species, G. costaricense. Three additional newly described species were added to the genus in 2014–2016, from collections made in Brazil and Thailand.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe thallus of Glaucotrema is characterised by a pale green-grey to pale olive-green colour, with a surface that can range from smooth to slightly uneven. It features a densely packed outer layer (cortex) composed of tightly interwoven fungal cells (prosoplectenchymatous structure). Within this structure lies a layer of algae cells (the photobiont), interspersed with clusters of calcium oxalate crystals.\nThe reproductive structures of Glaucotrema, known as apothecia, are typically rounded to angular and can be either slightly emerging from the thallus or prominently displayed. The discs of these structures range in colour from flesh-colured to pale brown and are thinly covered with a white, powdery coating (pruinose). The edges of these discs are usually smooth, though they can occasionally be fissured. While a true central support column (columella) is absent, a pseudo-column (pseudocolumella) often appears, consisting of tissue strands that originate from the side of the cup-like structure (lateral excipulum). The excipulum (the tissue surrounding the reproductive disc) also has a tightly interwoven cellular structure (prosoplectenchymatous) and is typically colourless. It may either remain attached or become partially detached and perforated (fenestrate). There are no hair-like structures (periphysoids) around the edges of the disc. The spore-producing filaments (paraphyses) within the apothecia are simple and unbranched.\nSpores produced by Glaucotrema are typically eight per sac (ascus), ellipsoid in shape, and divided into four parts by three cross-walls (3-septate), with thick dividers and lens-shaped internal spaces (lumina). These spores are colourless and turn violet-blue when stained with iodine (I+ violet-blue). Glaucotrema thailandicum is unique in the genus in having submuriform ascospores. Chemically, Glaucotrema contains psoromic acid, which reacts yellow when tested with paraphenylenediamine (P+ yellow), indicating its presence.\n\n\n== Species ==\nGlaucotrema bahianum Lücking (2015) – Brazil\nGlaucotrema costaricense (Müll.Arg.)

        "content": "McDonald's french fries, marketed as World Famous Fries are a french fries product at the fast food restaurant McDonald's.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIntroduced in 1949, the french fries were cooked in a mixture of 93% beef tallow and 7% cottonseed oil. \nIn the 1950s, CEO and founder Ray Kroc established quality control measures for McDonald's suppliers, ensuring potatoes maintained a solids content within the optimal range of twenty to twenty-three percent. Kroc also pioneered the practice of \"curing\" the potatoes to convert sugars to starch, thus achieving consistently crisp French fries. This process involved storing potatoes at warm temperatures for several weeks. Additionally, he introduced the \"potato computer,\" developed by Louis Martino, to calculate the precise cooking time for fries, based on the fluctuation of oil temperature during frying.\nSubsequently, in 1967, Ray Kroc of McDonald's contracted the Simplot company to supply them with frozen fries, replacing fresh-cut potatoes.\nIn the late 1980s, Phil Sokolof, a millionaire businessman who had suffered a heart attack at the age of 43, took out full-page newspaper ads in New York, Chicago, and other large cities accusing McDonald's menu of being a threat to American health, and asking them to stop using beef tallow to cook their french fries.\nAfter this sustained campaign, including by the National Heart Savers Association against saturated fats and the beef tallow they were using, in 1990 they switched to vegetable oil with beef flavouring \nThe \"thin style\" french fries have been popularised worldwide in large part by  McDonald's and Burger King.\nIn 2008, McDonald's got rid of trans fats in both US and Canada markets. In 2013, McDonald's Canada introduced poutine nationwide, after having it in Quebec for 10 years.\n\n\n== Product ==\nMcDonald's US fries are made using 19 ingredients which include dextrose, TBHQ, polydimethylsiloxane, citric acid, and sodium acid pyrophosphate. As for their potatoes, non-GMO russet and Shepody kinds are used. \nAs for the manufacturing process, the potatoes are first brought to the plant where they are mechanically cut, blanched, partially fried, flash-frozen, then shipped to individual restaurants of the franchise and served.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFrench fries\nMcDonalds\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Days of '98 Show is a Klondike Gold Rush-themed musical theater show performed in Eagles Hall in Skagway, Alaska. It is the longest running Alaskan theatrical show. Created in the 1920s, the show was put on by the Skagway chapter of the Fraternal Order of Eagles and performed infrequently in the 1930s. By the mid-20th century, the show was performed frequently in the summer, particularly on days when cruise ships and passenger ships docked. It was staffed by unpaid locals and used to fundraise for various causes including a local hockey team, an elderly care facility, and Christmas toys for all Skagway children.\nRight after World War II, The Days of '98 Show began being presented with a format that would be used into the 1970s. It featured mock gambling, can-can performances, period costumes from the Klondike Gold Rush era, and a recitation and pantomime of the Robert W. Service poem \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\". By 1977, the Eagles encountered dwindling membership and financial difficulties with their sole income stream, The Days of '98 Show, not making a profit that year. They inducted new members into the organization including people who were performing in the play Soapy Lives about the conman Soapy Smith. The two shows merged in 1978 after the members rewrote the script, combining elements from both shows. The revised Days of '98 Show depicts various events from Skagway's frontier history. It portrays Smith and his gang's hold on Skagway and ends with the shootout on Juneau Wharf between Smith and vigilante Frank H. Reid. The show received positive reviews for being an engaging production that teaches about Skagway's history.\n\n\n== Eagles Hall ==\n\nThe Days of '98 Show is put on by the Skagway Aerie No. 25, Fraternal Order of Eagles and Gold Rush Productions. Established in June 1899, the Order purchased the Eagles Hall, where the show is performed. The Eagles Hall's predecessor was two hotels established in 1898: the Mondamin Hotel on Fifth Avenue close to Main and the Pacific Hotel on Sixth and Broadway. The Order acquired the Pacific Hotel in 1902. After the Pacific Hotel was partially relocated in 1920 to the Mondamin Hotel's posterior, the Eagles bought the building, refurbishing it into a hall and theater. Audrey Prest of the Daily News of Los Angeles in 1989 found Eagles Hall to be reminiscent of a red barn.\nSince the hall did not have a stage in 1979, the show was performed on the ground. In 1984, the lobby was furnished with gambling tables, while the theater had \"rough hewn walls\". The building has offices and a theater with velvet curtains. The ambiance in the theater resembles a saloon during the gold rush. Citing the creeky stairs and the \"smells of decades of popcorn butter and a hint of whiskey\", Mike Swasey of KHNS said that the theater \"smells, sounds, and feels like a classic theatre\". The Skagway News's Marc Bona said in 2023 that the aroma of aged wood and freshly made popcorn permeates the structure. To attract people to watch the show, costumed women sing as they balance on the windowsill of the second floor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe Days of '98 Show is a rowdy vaudevillian melodrama, musical revue, comedy, extravaganza, and historical play. Sources have given different years for when the show began being performed: 1923, 1925, 1926, 1927, or 1932. Festive gatherings in honor of the 1898 gold rush were held intermittently in the 1930s. In its early years, the show would be performed a handful of occasions each summer. Soon after World War II, a show was put into place containing mock gambling, dancing, can-can dancers, and \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\". Ann True, the show's general manager in 1973, said that upon her arrival in Skagway in 1946, Days of '98 had already been performed like this. The author Robert L. S. Spude said in 1986 that of Alaskan shows, The Days of '98 Show had been performed the longest. The author Catherine Holder said in 2012 that of currently running Alaskan theater shows, The Days of '98 Show had the earliest premiere. Patricia Corrigan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said in 1986 the show has been called \"the longest running show on Broadway\". The initial iteration of the show featured local performers, while the modern shows are done by skilled actors.\nNumerous cruise ship excursions include the show as a possible activity. In the mid-20th century, the show was performed in the summer, particularly on days when cruise ships and passenger ships like SS Prince George and SS Princess Louise docked. In 1949, residents put on a \"Days of '98 Dance\" in which they wore clothes from the Klondike Gold Rush era. Example attire for men included \"Christie-stiffs, wide-brimmed miners' hats, moth-eaten toppers [with] string ties and perhaps a scarlet weskit\". To depict high-class women, residents wore feathered heats to represent \"lady that's known as Lou\" (the character from \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\") and \"Diamond Lil\". To depict women who would join men on the Chilkoot Pass, they wore \"high-buttoned boots and bustles\". The show earned $300 on a regular successful evening in 1949.\nThe residents of Skagway began putting on the show to fund their hockey group after Princess steamships began making stops in the city. In 1956, the show's proceeds were put towards paying the orchestra and compensating performers' babysitters and the remaining amount went towards the elderly care facility in Sitka, Alaska. Funds earned from the show were used around 1963 were for causes including cancer charity and Christmas toys for children. Funds in 1965 went to the Vancouver Sailors' Home and the Vancouver Crippled Children's Association. Profits from the show in 1971 went to purchasing Christmas presents for the children.\nA 1964 newspaper article said the show required no fewer than 20 individuals to host each performance and none of them received compensation. In 1965, Days of '98 was performed between April and the beginning of October. The 1967 cast of more than 50 people put on more than 60 shows. Performed three to four times weekly, the Days of '98 Show in 1971 had two casts that took turns appearing in the production every other week. A subset of the cast had to appear in all shows since there were insufficient people to fill up both casts. There were 90 planned performances in 1973.\n\n\n=== Merger of Days of '98 Show and Soapy Lives ===\nTom Biss, an actor, moved in 1973 from Anchorage, Alaska, to Skagway. He performed that summer in a one-person play, Soap Pitch (later called Soapy Lives) in a log cabin. The venue was in Skagway's American Legion Hall on Seventh and Broadway. In the winter that year, Biss performed the show in Juneau and Ketchikan. He returned to Skagway in 1974 to perform a more elaborate show in the Arctic Brotherhood lodge hall involving more actors. He established the company Soap Theatrical Co. for putting on the play. Judy Irving, the venue's spotlight manager, used M. Mike Miller's 1970 book Soapy as the foundation for penning the script of Soapy Lives for Biss. Written from the first-person of the frontier gangster Soapy Smith, Soapy offers a positive spin on his life in which he reflects on his youthful mishaps. Having worked as an Alaska Sportsman journalist, Miller likely relied on the magazine's 1950s and 1960s articles as research content for his book. Al Swingle wrote music for the play. The Arctic Brotherhood set was constructed using wood from a Dyea beach.\nThe show starts with two members of Smith's gang, played by Jim Richards and Steve Hites. As they consume alcohol, the duo sing several songs as they nostalgically recall their interactions with Smith. Hites plays the piano and the guitar while Richards plays the guitar and the banjo. A woman, a dance hall performer, appears in the play. Coming out of his saloon, Biss's Soapy Smith introduces himself to the viewers. He describes how he swindled people in Skagway and became the town's ruler. Bemoaning the vigilante \"Committee of 101\" that seeks his removal, he criticizes his associates for their foolish avarice in stealing from a man. He is resolute in thwarting Frank Reid, who wants to overthrow him. The show reaches its climax when Smith dies during the shootout on Juneau Wharf with Reid.\nWhile performing in his own show at night, Biss acted as Soapy Smith in the Days of '98 Show in the day and participated in its \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" performance. The show brought on a narrator and a pianist before Jim Richards purchased it from Biss in 1975. In Soapy Lives, Richards had played a Soapy Smith gang member who was a banjo player and later started playing Soapy Smith. In June 1977, Tyler Eccles played \"Slim Jim\" Foster, a member of Smith's gang. That year, Soapy Lives had been staged about 450 times. At the time, Eagles Hall had a community production called the Days of '98 Show that was performed in the late evenings. To avoid a head-to-head clash, Soapy Lives scheduled shows during the daytime hours, catering to cruise ships.\nThe Days of '98 Show relied on a volunteer cast and scheduled 62 performances in the summer of 1977. That year, the Eagles introduced additional songs. The production was performed in 1977 every time SS Princess Patricia, and MS Prinsendam were in port and a number of the times Monarch Star docked. Both Soapy Lives and the Days of '98 Show had trouble financially supporting the performers. Around 40,000 cruise ship passengers had docked in Skagway in 1975, a small number that could barely sustain Soapy Lives performers Richards, a musician, and an actress. Eagles Hall encountered financial problems in 1977 after its sole income stream, Days of '98 Show, had failed to turn a profit that year. With few members left in the organization, they could not cover the property tax or the membership fees. Their inability to pay the oil bill led to the freezing of their pipes. Eagles Hall had six members left when, realizing they needed a change, members George Flemming and J. D. True suggested adding six young performers to the club's membership rolls. Their aim was to prevent the Grand Aerie from taking over the property and to continue putting on showings of the Days of '98 Show. The six members were inducted as Eagles members during a rite performed on a table in Flemming's kitchen. The new members included Jim Richards and Steve Hites. The initiation of these new members later led to a merger of the Days of '98 Show and the play Soapy Lives.\nThe process to revise the format and script of the Days of '98 Show began in December 1977. Jim Richards and Steve Hites were housemates. After spending hours fighting a house fire that month, Steve Hites returned to his own house and started sleeping in a chair without getting changed. According to Hites, Richards roused him from sleep and urged him to take notes as Richards outlined a new Days of '98 Show. Richards suggested combining elements of the Soapy Lives show and the Days of 98 show. The show would feature new songs. It would have William Moore narrate about finding the White Pass. It would feature the Days of 98 Show's can-can performers and discuss Skagway's history including Soapy Smith's death. Hites delivered the notes to Tom Healy, who refined the dialogue and acts. Richards, Hites, and Healy jointly came up with a revised script. Hites wrote some of the new show's music, while Richards wrote two songs: \"The Boomtown Saloon\" and \"Moonlight, the Yukon and You\".\nRichards and Dorothy Shaplin founded the company Gold Rush Productions to put on the revised production in collaboration with the previous show's producer, the Fraternal Order of Eagles. Run by volunteers, the show's previous version was performed three to four times a week for three decades and depleted the pool of people willing to contribute their efforts without compensation. The new show's cast received compensation. Hites, the director of the revised show, said in 2009 that 26 people made up the cast of the revamped show, while Barbara Kalen of Whitehorse Daily Star said in 1978 that the show featured a cast of 14 to 15 people. Kalen wrote that a number of people longed for the show's prior version. She concluded that the majority found \"this new authentic historical sketch is really much better, and has wider audience appeal\".\nIn both Days of '98 Show and Soapy Lives, the audiences are startled by the loud noises of blanks being fired in the confined space of the theater during the shootout between Smith and Reid. According to Hites, the two versions portray the circumstances of Smith's differently. In Soapy Lives, under muted red lighting, Smith and Reid meet and shout lines sourced from the event's eyewitnesses. Using black powder blanks, they exchange gunfire, causing flashes to appear. It is clear that Reid killed Smith. In contrast, in the revised Days of '98 Show, Smith exits from the audience's view after readying his Winchester rifle and shouting \"They can't take this town from me! I run this town!\" The narrator discusses how Smith is traveling to the Juneau Company Wharf, where the vigilantes will confront him. The narrator says \"A man like Reid did his deed\", a blank is shot out of view of the audience, and the narrator concludes, \"And sent poor Soapy home.\" Hites said the aim is to allow viewers to hint that Reid was responsible for pulling the trigger Smith but allow viewers to decide what happened.\nin 1978, Jim Richards played the role of the protagonist, Soapy Smith, in the Days of '98 and continued performing three days a week in Soapy Lives. Over a period of 33 years, he made over 10,000 appearances as Soapy Smith. After experiencing a stroke in the middle of show on August 28, 2009, he performed his last show that year on September 17.\n\n\n=== Soapy Smith's wake ===\nBeginning in 1974, Soapy Smith's descendants and the show's actors attended an annual wake for Smith on July 8, the anniversary of his death. The first wake was held at Smith's grave at the Gold Rush Cemetery. The revelers brought champagne to toast Smith. Since the cemetery did not have lavatories, they urinated on the grave of Frank H. Reid, a guard who had died in a shootout with Smith. In the 1980s, after doing the final performance of the day, the actors visited Smith's grave on his death anniversary. During the celebration, Smith's grandson, who lived in California, brought champagne to share. Jeff Hall, the president of the Soapy Smith Preservation Trust, said the \"horrid tradition\" of urinating on Reid's grave was a factor in their decision to move the wake from the cemetery to Eagles Hall. Following discussions with Reid's family, Jeff Smith, Soapy Smith's great-grandson, apologized to them three decades after the first wake. Jeff Smith said, \"I know how upset I would be were I to find that people were doing to Soapy's grave what we had begun doing to Frank Reid's in 1974.\"\n\n\n=== Later history ===\nDirected by David Morgan, people from the drama department at Brigham Young University performed for the show in the early 1990s. The show had daytime and nighttime performances in the early 2000s. With a schedule significantly influenced by cruise ships, the show in the 21st century is performed between once and four times a day between the middle of May and the middle of September. The Wall Street Journal said in 2011 that thousands of cruise ship tourists watched the show every summer.\nBetween circa 2010 and December 2019, Jonathan Baldwin and Jonathan Hays owned Gold Rush Productions, which put on the Days of '98 Show. Charity Pomeroy and Meredith Schmidt acquired Gold Rush Productions in December 2019 and became its joint artistic directors. Pomeroy had moved to Skagway in 2001 to be a performer in the show. The next season, zero cruise ships docked in Skagway in 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Alaska. The following year, the estimated number of summer cruise ship visitors was below 10% of previous seasons, so the two owners sought to minimize costs as they put on the performance. Pomeroy took on the role of Belle Davenport, while Schmidt performed as Squirrel Tooth Alice. Soapy Smith was portrayed by the proprietor of a nearby lodge, whom they paid to take on the role. They employed a Pennsylvania-based piano player and several lighting technicians. The Days of '98 Show performed 33 summer shows in 2021, far below the approximately 400 shows they would previously do. During the pandemic, COVID-19 relief funds from the federal government ensured the business remained afloat. Pomeroy rents an office in the hall where she fixes costumes.\n\n\n== Show ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nSkagway had over 20,000 inhabitants in 1898 when Klondike Gold Rush prospectors swarmed the town and Dyea which they used as their launching pad to journey through Chilkoot Trail and White Pass Trail to the Klondike territory of Yukon. An 1898 report from the North-West Mounted Police called Skagway \"little better than a hell on earth\". Mounties maintained control in Canada, while Skagway was a free-for-all. The conman Soapy Smith and his associates controlled the town. His rule ended after a shootout on Juneau Wharf involving the vigilante Frank H. Reid left the two men dead. By 1979, Skagway's population reached around 800, down from the over 20,000 in 1898.\n\n\n=== Pre-show activities ===\nThe Days of 98 Show had several pre-show activities in 1956. Visitors purchased $1 to receive $100 in fake money for an hour of mock gambling. They could play blackjack or visit two roulette tables and two dice tables. At the conclusion of the gambling, a prize was given to the person with the largest sum of money. The prize was an Eskimo carving made of ivory in a 1956 show. For a 1971 show, the prize was a small-scale model of the \"Prospector\" statue positioned outside the Sitka Pioneer Home. Young women from the cast strode through the venue, attempting to get the men in the audience to join them in dancing. When guests went to the dance floor, a marshal squeezed them, making them pay $1 to post bail for dancing with dishonorable characters. The kangaroo court would give the guests a card saying they were apprehended for dancing with Klondike Kate, Diamond-Tooth Lil, or the Oregon Mare. Vigilantes would fetch people who opted not to dance alongside the show's cast and bring them to a kangaroo court, which would impose a $1.00 penalty. An auctioneer peddled Lady Lou's garter.\nThe pre-show activities of the revamped 1978 show resembled those of the prior version. The show's 21st-century iteration continued to have several pre-show activities. For an hour before the show, ragtime music is played and there is \"mock gambling\" with \"Soapy's money\". The writer M. Mike Miller said the gambling was \"strictly-for-fun\" and children could participate. The show's actors serve as dealers at the casino. A number of the card tables are from the gold rush era. The gambling victor in the 1978 and in the 1980s received the prize of being able to take off a dancer's garter. In a 1982 show, an auctioneers sold the garter of \"a well-endowed redhead sprawled on the bar\" to the person willing to pay the most. He took her garter, and she asked him to visit her room situated on top of the bar. He also received a small part in the play. The show commemorates Robert W. Service in a segment called \"The Vagabond of Verse\". His poetry is recited 30 minutes before the show starts. Through his humorous poetry, Service chronicled the later years of the gold rush.\n\n\n=== Main show ===\n\n\n==== Post-World War II version ====\n\nRight after World War II, a show with a format that would be used into the 1970s was put into place. The show had seven acts in 1963. It featured can-can performances: one lineup had high school students and another had married women. Locals wore period costumes from the Klondike Gold Rush era. Songs from the '98 era were performed and danced to. The show begins with Rough House Rosie appearing on stage. She is clad in furs adorned with violet-hued feathers and an ostrich-feathered hat and sings:\n\nPlayed by a matriarch from the town, the singer shrieks in the raucous environment, and from time to time shows her red flannel panties by lifting her skirt. A woman sings \"Bill Bailey\" and \"Ain't She Sweet\". The musicians include a pianist, two saxophonists, and two drummers. Backed by a pianist, another woman sings a tune about the difficulty in finding a quality man. The show's monologist, Queenie, dances with a number of make-believe men including one who dances with his eyes shut, causing her foot to end up in a spittoon. Clad in a red vest, H.D. Kirmse tells historical anecdotes about Alaska such as his jeweler father's 1898 creation of a huge nugget chain for Pat Renwick, a gambler who used the chain as collateral. Performing songs he wrote in both English and Tlingit, Richard Dick, a Klukwan man from the Eagle Tlingit clan, sings in a deep Tlingit accent while playing the guitar. Several people sing the state song \"Alaska's Flag\".\nThe show ends with a performer reading the Robert W. Service poem \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" and performers pantomiming it. McGrew drinks a ginger ale as miners assemble at a table and his girlfriend, Lou, watch him. The narrator recites from the poem, \"In stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks, dog-dirty and loaded for bear.\" At this time, a man dressed in fur enters and plays the Johannes Brahms tune \"Cradle Song\" at the piano. The narrator says, \"My God, but that man could play!\" Dangerous Dan McGrew and the Stranger have a shootout as the room plunges into darkness. Lou weeps over her boyfriend's lifeless body and takes the gold dust.\n\n\n==== Post-1978 version ====\n\nThe Days of '98 Show underwent a rewrite in 1978 and is about the Klondike gold rush and other events from Skagway history. It has six acts and a one-hour runtime. The show has audience participation in which some people near the stage are included in the performance. Banjo and piano players perform ragtime, while dance hall performers dance the can-can. The show features can-can performers named Molly Fewclothes, Belle Davenport, and Squirrel Tooth Alice. It has humorous patter and songs from the era.\nThe show's starring characters include William Moore, the steamship captain who was Skagway's first settler; the con man Soapy Smith; Reverend Bowers, a member of Smith's gang; and J.D. Stewart, the Stampeder (a gold rush prospector). Steamship captain Moore begins the production by sharing his visions of the impending gold rush and the swarm of Stampeders that would descend upon the area. A separate scene depicts how Vernie Woodward brought back to life her partner, who had been trapped in the Chilkoot Trail's April 3, 1898, avalanche. In a humorous skit, a horse gradually crumples under the load of the items stacked on the animal. The sketch illustrates how thousands of overburdened horses had died on the trail. The railroad contractor Michael James Heney and the London financier Thomas Tancrede talk about the potential for building a railroad. Heney pronounces, \"If you give me enough dynamite and snoose, I'll build you a railroad to Hell.\" Heney constructs the railroad White Pass and Yukon Route leading from Skagway to Whitehorse.\nIt depicts the chaos caused in Skagway between 1897 and 1898 by main character Soapy Smith, who portrays himself as honorable person. During the gold rush, Smith swindles prospectors who stop at Skagway as they journey to Yukon Territory in pursuit of gold. Four days before city surveyor Frank H. Reid kills him, Smith is at the head of an Independence Day parade in 1898 with John Green Brady, the governor of the District of Alaska. Several days after the parade, J.D. Stewart, the Stampeder, brings back gold worth $2,400 ($87,898 in 2023). In Clancy's Saloon, Smith associate Reverend Bowers robs Stewart of the gold, triggering the shootout on Juneau Wharf that killed Smith and Reid. The shootings unfold out of view of the audience with a blank going off. The deafening gunshot in the enclosed theater startles the audience. The production ends with every cast member singing the state song \"Alaska's Flag\".\n\n\n== Notable performers ==\nMichael Baish made his initial trip in 1985 to Skagway to be director of the Days of '98 Show. During the summer, he visited Skagway, where he presented the poems of Robert W. Service for the show.\nWilliam Jefferson Brady in 1982 played the character J.D. Stewart, the gold prospector whom Soapy Smith and his associates rob in the Days of '98 Show. He also participated in pre-show activities including as a casino dealer for the mock gambling as well as an auctioneer who sells a garter to the top bidder. Brady founded The Skagway News in 1978.\nRichard Dick began participating in the show around 1958. Born in Angoon, he was a Klukwan man from the Eagle Tlingit clan. While playing the electric guitar, he performed songs he wrote in both English and Tlingit in a deep Tlingit accent. Alta Barger, a resident of Fort Worth, Texas, visited Skagway in 1967 and watched Dick at the Days of '98 Show. The two married in Skagway on January 19, 1968.\nBuckwheat Donahue tried out to be a Frank H. Reid understudy. He was selected to play Reid. During casting, he paused on reaching commas, something that other auditioners could not do. According to Donahue, the director chose him for that capability since directing him would be the most effortless. He undertook additional parts in the production and took on the position of president for the Skagway Fraternal Order of Eagles.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n==== Post-World War II version ====\nLyn Harrington of the Vancouver Sun said in 1949, \"It isn't high art, perhaps, but it is an escape into a different world for travellers.\" Writing for Michigan Quarterly Review, the academic Dow V. Baxter in 1963 praised Pauline Pribbenaw's performance as Rough House Rosie, saying she \"puts some some awesome pathos into her number when she reaches for an emphatic crescendo\". Mrs. Harlow Kline of the Statesville Record & Landmark praised the show in 1958 for providing \"fun and laughter for all\" and cited the dancing, music, mock gambling, and \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" performance. Dunc Holmes of the Vancouver Sun said in 1965, \"The whole show is amateurish, but charming, and invariably gets a standing ovation\", while the National Post's Kit Morgan found the show \"amateurish but fun\" in 1970.\n\n\n==== Post-1978 version ====\nThe Kerrville Mountain Sun's Marjorie Peters in 1979 found the production to be \"an enjoyable evening [that] gave us an insight into Skagway's bawdy, notorious past\". Referring to Canadian shows put on in Whitehorse and Dawson City, Jean Koenig of the Edmonton Journal found in 1979 that the show was unable to replicate the Follies performances' sparkle and flair but was at least as expensive if not more so than those shows. But she concluded \"it's a fun evening for visitors and does illustrate the community spirit of a town that has survived, and today lives by tourism and the railway\". The Dallas Morning News's Donnis Baggett in 1984 called the show \"a good local theatrical production\" that gives the audience \"a colorful look at the town's rambunctious past\".\nThe authors Ed and Lynn Readicker-Henderson praised The Days of '98 Show for providing a \"good, entertaining history of Skagway\" that featured Soapy Smith and Frank Reid's altercation. Rough Guides called it \"an entertaining, if somewhat cheesy, historical musical\". Audrey Prest of the Daily News of Los Angeles lauded the show for giving viewers a sense of \"the rough-and-tumble frontier era from the high-energy cast of swaggering scoundrels and petticoated dance-hall girls\" and \"an entertaining way to get your history lesson\". The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Colin Bessonette deemed the show to have \"noisy overacting and slapstick routines\" and would not work on Broadway but called it \"perfect here in small-town Alaska\". The San Diego Union-Tribune travel writer Dan Gindling considered the production \"thoroughly delightful\", citing the mock gambling before the show, the women dancers, and the shootouts.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAarons, Felice; Johansen, Heidi, eds.
