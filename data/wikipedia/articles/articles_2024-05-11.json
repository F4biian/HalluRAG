        "content": "Pedro Vives Vich (20 January 1858 – 9 March 1938) was a Spanish military engineer, politician, and aerial observer, who was the main pioneer of Spanish ballooning and aviation, both military and civil. In 1896, Vives was made head of the Servicios de Aerostación (\"Aerostation Services\"), and at his suggestion, the army adopted the kite-type ballon and then had it built in Guadalajara. He was the first Spaniard to fly in an airplane in 1909. He served as the first Chief of the Spanish Air Force, which was founded in 1913 at his request.\nHe was also a publicist, and as such, he directed several technical studies, directed military works (in the Pyrenees, Lleida, Cuba, Morocco), including the First Melillan campaign in 1893. In Africa, he not only participated in war flights, but also created new aerodromes. He later became the military governor of Cartagena in 1922–23, and then as the Development Minister of Spain between 1923 and 1925. He left an enormous and multifaceted technical work for the beginning of Spanish aviation and for the modernization of the public works of the State.\n\n\n== Early and education ==\nPedro Vives was born in Igualada, Catalonia, on 20 January 1858, as the son of Pedro Vives Ramón and Irene Vich Picornell. He was born into a family of small businessmen, owners of cotton spinning and weaving factories located in Igualada and Manresa. He was known as Pere familiarly, the Catalan version of his name. The Vives family took their three sons, Jaime, Francisco, and Pedro, to a boarding school in Manresa, run by the Jesuits, where they attended high school.\nWhen Pedro finished school, he chose to become a military engineer, going to Guadalajara to prepare for the Academy of Engineers, which he entered in 1874. A very diligent student with impeccable conduct, he received his lieutenant's office four years later, in 1878, where he finished his degree as number 1 in his class. His first assignment was at the Las Vascongadas, in the Mining Sappers Regiment.\n\n\n== Military career ==\n\n\n=== First positions and stints in Paris, Cuba, and US ===\nIn May 1878, the general director of the Arma gave him a Service Commission for one month to visit the Universal Exhibition in Paris, where his interest in the advances in technology and science of his time led him to identify with its most modern achievements. Upon his return, Vives began his life as a sapper-miner, in the 4th Regiment in the Northern Army, where in addition to commanding troops and other jobs, he carried out fortification work (one of his specialties) on the Pyrenean and Aragonese borders (Canfranc and Jaca) and later he took care of defense work on the French border in Navarre. He was promoted to captain in 1880 and was assigned to Cartagena, where he stayed for a short time, as he was then assigned to Madrid and later to Barcelona.\nIn 1881, Vives volunteered for Cuba, serving in the Santa Clara Engineer Command, but he only remained there for three years due to being uncomfortable in garrison life. Before returning to Spain in 1884, he requested a six-month leave of absence to move to the United States, with the aim of perfecting his English, and expanding his technical and scientific knowledge in San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and other cities; while there, he made his living as an engineer. In this country, he studied mechanical traction in trams, and as a result of this experience he published in the Memorial de Ingenieros (Memorial of Engineers) an article called \"Trams moved by underground cables\" which, due to its originality, aroused great expectation among technicians. He also participated in installing the Spanish pavilion at the 1884 Boston International Exposition, of the objectives that the Spanish Artillery contributed to the event.\n\n\n=== Military works in Lleida, Cádiz, and Melilla (1884–1895) ===\nAfter returning to Spain in 1884, Vives was assigned to the Lleida Engineer Command, which was one of the most fruitful stages of his professional activity. He studied the border area with France, focusing his attention on the Val d'Aran, where he intervened in the layout of the road from Viella to the French border, thoroughly studying the possibilities of constructing a tunnel as the only means of saving the Val d'Aran from the total isolation to which he was condemned during the winter. It was an enormous work that everyone considered a utopia; all except Vives, who years later held the position of Undersecretary of Development in the board of directors of General Primo de Rivera, and from that position, he promoted the work of the tunnel, six kilometers long, until it was completely drilled.\nIn 1887, for health reasons, he began to provide his services in the Campo de Gibraltar in the province of Cádiz, where in Tarifa, he designed the fortifications and sites to defend the Strait of Gibraltar. A year later, he was assigned to the Malaga Engineer Command, where he created and developed a military dovecote, which went on to play such an important role in communications with Melilla during the First Melillan campaign in 1893. For his work and participation in this campaign, he was awarded the Cross of Military Merit with a white badge.\n\n\n== Pioneer of Spanish aviation ==\n\n\n=== Aerostation Service in Guadalajara (1896–1901) ===\nOn 30 September 1896, a Royal Order from the Ministry of War created the Military Aerostation Service, established its headquarters in Guadalajara, and placed it under the command of Commander Pedro Vives Vich, who was called back to the Peninsula to take charge of it in October 1896, thus ending his first performance in Africa and beginning his destination to Guadalajara, where the Park will be located. In December 1896, the Aerostation Park was created in the Henares Maneuver Park, and on 15 January 1897, Vives took charge of the first material that this space would have, the so-called 'Yon system aerostatic train', to transfer it to Guadalajara. The Aerostation Park in Guadalajara was the first military air base in Spain, and began its flight operations in 1900.\nThe first objective that he imposed was the acquisition of the essential material to be able to begin aerostatic activities. Soon the officers, engineers-pilots who carried out the ascensions, built their own aerostats, generating what can be considered an artisanal self-construction industry, but none of the officers assigned to the ballooning unit had flight experience. To obtain the pilot's title and learn how aerial observation was applied in other armies, Commander Vives and Captain Tejera traveled to Paris on 1 June 1897 under an official commission, which also took him to cities in Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where he studied the advances of military ballooning in those countries; these official commissions continued during the following years, 1899 and 1900. Upon returning from this trip, he wrote a report that made his superiors decide to implement the kite balloon as a matter of regulation, compared to the other option of the spherical balloon. During his travels through Europe, in Munich specifically, his first ascent in a captive balloon took place, Paris being the city where he carried out his first free ascent, completing the Paris-Fort de Vances route (thirteen kilometers). In another of his travels, this one to Bern in 1899, he traveled to Friedrichshafen to visit the facilities of Count Zeppelin, then dedicated to the construction of the LZ1 that would be raised the following year.\nVives continued with his eagerness for organization and established barracks, parks, and the Aerostation Polygon in Guadalajara, and after overcoming the difficulties that arose, on 1 December 1900, with the first kite-type balloon acquired from Germany, he finally carried out the first \"free ascension\" of Spanish Military Aeronautics. The crew was made up of Pedro Vives Vich and Captain Fernando Giménez Sáenz, they were followed on horseback towards Alcalá de Henares by the lieutenant of the ballooning company Alfredo Kindelán, who later stated that \"the event was not an improvisation. Vives, a methodical and consistent man, did not trust improvisation at all. On the contrary, all his actions and decisions were the fruit of a mature and profound study\". This impression is confirmed by the Royal Order of 1901, where the pleasure with which the King Alfonso XIII saw the intelligence and industriousness in the planning and development of the aerostatic service is expressed, on the occasion of the approved report of the Services during the year 1900. The ascensions continued and until June 1903, 24 free flights were made on the balloon named Mars, and 5 on Venus. In an ascension made by the Mars balloon on 25 October 1902, the crew members were prepared to test an idea from Vives, which consisted of a ballast bag tied to a 15-meter-long rope that would allow them to cushion the speed of descent, upon touching the ground and suddenly unloading the corresponding weight, which shows that Vives not only had the desire to fly, but also to experiment to provide solutions to the development of air navigation.\nIn 1903, Vives and his officers studied the possibility of building themselves the types of balloons they had in operation, that is, spherical and captive kite-type balloons, seeking greater economy in the acquisition of material. Thus in 1903, he took responsibility for the construction of balloons, with the first one completed being a kite type, with a little more volume than the German originals to achieve greater lift; it was given the name Alfonso. The next was the spherical Uranus that participated, along with Jupiter and Mars, in the observation of the solar eclipse on 30 August 1905. At his suggestion, the army adopted the kite-type ballon and then had it built in Guadalajara.\n\n\n== International Congresses of Scientific Aeronautics (1902–1906) ==\nAt the beginning of 1902, Vives was the first head of the Aviation Army who, with little military hierarchy, since he was only a commander, convinced General Weyler, Minister of War, to create balloon observer officers and managed to have the first course held that year, which must be attended by one officer from each Corps of Engineers. Due to the Spanish Military Air Force being presented as a reality at the European level at the time, Spain was invited to participate in conferences on ballooning that were to be held in Berlin in May 1902, and Vives was appointed to represent the Ministry of War, and such was his participation that he was unanimously appointed member of the International Commission Permanent Scientific Aerostation. He thus took part in different international congresses of Scientific Aeronautics, such as Berlin in 1902, Peterburg in 1904, or Milan in 1906. In September 1902, his Aerostation Company carried out shooting observation experiences from a balloon at the Carabanchel camp for the first time in Spain, and the success achieved was such that the chief general of the Central Shooting School, who expressed his gratitude, stating that he admired \"the scientific knowledge, experience, and military correctness that Lieutenant Colonel Vives has been able to instill in the unit he commands\".\nIn 1902, Vives received a technical report from Leonardo Torres Quevedo about his airship project, a steerable aerostat of original design, in case it could be of interest to the Army, but Vives' response was skeptical since he considered that up to now none of those that had been built and tested had military application. However, he went to make the Aerostation Park workshops available to the inventor for the construction and testing of the airship. In 1906, tests were carried out with satisfactory results, but despite the success achieved and the enthusiasm of Torres Quevedo, Alfredo Kindelán, and Vives, the airship was never manufactured in Spain. In 1906 he was made vice-president of the International Aeronautical Society.\nIn the aforementioned congress of Saint Petersburg in 1904, it was agreed that simultaneous balloon ascensions would be carried out in several European cities, to study the influence of an eclipse on the atmosphere. To this end, on the day of the Solar eclipse of August 30, 1905, ascents were made from the Burgos Artillery Park, with Vives as pilot of the Jupiter, accompanied by Professor Berson and Doctor Romeo, who rose with the purpose of carrying out meteorological and spectroscopic observations of great scientific interest.\n\n\n=== First Spaniard to fly in an airplane and first flight over Madrid (1908–1912) ===\nOn 2 March 1908, Vives, now a colonel, was assigned to the Cádiz Engineer Command and months later to Ceuta, where he resumed his unique skills as an Africanist and engineer, without abandoning his dream of aeronautical precursor. Likewise, despite his assignment to the command, he continued in the organization and regulation commission that he held in the aerostatic service. In January 1909, Colonel Vives and Captain Kindelán carried out a service commission in England, France, Germany, and Italy, to study airships and airplanes in their military applications. During this commission, in Germany, he had the opportunity to travel by airship, making three ascents. Also during this commission, while trying to fly an airplane at the school that the Wright brothers had established in Pau, he suffered an accident. Two months later, he returned to Paris to resume his interrupted studies on the Wright airplane and finally managed to fly in an airplane, thus becoming the first Spaniard to do so.\nAt the end of 1909, Vives and Kindelán issued a report in which they recommended the acquisition of an airship and an airplane for experimentation, but the Ministry of War decided to purchase the airship in France, from the Casa Astra workshops, and after numerous tests that were not very satisfactory, he moved to Guadalajara where the final tests ended up being carried out. On 4 May 1910, the airship already baptized with the name of España (\"Spain\"), crewed by Vives, Kindelán, and the mechanic Quesada, made a flight in which, for the first time, an airship crossed the sky of Madrid, thus introducing the dirigible to Spain. In September 1910, he was appointed director of the Academy of Engineers of Guadalajara, where he had finished his degree as number 1 in his class, and it was decided that, without prejudice to his destiny, he would continue to serve as head of the Aerostation Park and Service. In October 1910, a commission of chiefs and officers of the Aerostation service, chaired by Colonel Vives, left for Paris again to select the material necessary for airplane experimentation.\nOn 7 March 1911, the Regulations governing airplane experimentation were published, and Vives was put in charge of choosing the land to build the first military airfield and direct flight training. Cuatro Vientos thus became the first aerodrome of Spanish aeronautics, and in this field, starting on 15 March 1911, the first five students slowly began to assimilate the teachings of their instructors. In August 1912, Vives resigned from the Directorate of the Academy of Engineers to dedicate himself completely to Aeronautics. On 18 August, Vives received the baptism of blood by plane; when traveling as an observer in a \"Bristol\" airplane from Cuatro Vientos to Toledo, an engine failure caused the plane to descend and when landing it collided with a ditch in the ground, leaving the pilot unharmed and Vives slightly injured.\n\n\n=== Head of the Military Aeronautics Service ===\nIn recognition of the effectiveness developed by the Cuatro Vientos School, whose study and instruction program had been drafted by Colonel Vives, as well as the first aerial reconnaissance mission, also ordered by Vives, it was created by Decree of 28 February 1913, the Military Aeronautics Service with two branches, Aerostation and Aviation. When the Regulations were published, Colonel Vives assumed an extraordinary volume of command, with his powers being those that corresponded to a head of the Corps and his responsibility was enormous, given the special modality of the service and the activity that took place at the airfields. In 1912, Vives and Kindelán became the first two heads of the Aeronautics service and the Aviation branch respectively, something that at that time was unimaginable since airplanes did not yet exist and the evolution of the nascent Spanish military ballooning was unpredictable.\nWithin the Spanish army he was the founder and first head of the Spanish Aeronautics and proposed that they adopt aviation as a weapon of war, flying to Granada to agree with the director of the Gunpowder Factory about the technical conditions that the aviation bombs must have. In 1912, in the war in Morocco, he organized for the first time in the world a bombardment from the air, and during this time he founded airfields in Spain and Morocco. For instance, when he was commissioned to Tétouan to learn the necessary elements to cooperate in the operations that were about to begin against the rebel group of Bni Arouss, he chose the Sania Ranel field, which was the first African airfield of Spanish Aeronautics, and which he prepared to be able to defeat the enemy zone of Larache.\nBy 1914, Vives represented the aerial vanguard of everything that happened in Aviation. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 made it impossible to acquire material outside of Spain, which forced Vives to study a solution. With the support of public powers, he achieved the cooperation of the civil industry for the manufacture of aircraft, with him encouraging civil engineers to carry out technical studies aimed at providing national aircraft to Spanish Aviation. Thus, in 1915, he tried to achieve an airplane that would allow flights to continue in schools and squadrons in Africa; his plan, which he put into practice, began with the manufacture of a genuinely Spanish engine. In Barcelona, he forced the Hispano-Suiza automobile factory to design and develop an aviation engine, which obtained such a success that it was manufactured in a large series by the French subsidiary of Hispano-Suiza, and ended up playing a very prominent role in the war, but he still needed an aerial platform to mount, so he got the Cuatro Vientos aerodrome workshops to manufacture a prototype airplane (\"Arrow\") that would serve as a flying test bench for the Barcelona aeronautical engine.\nIn 1914, Colonel Vives began the negotiations to acquire the magnificent natural Tablada Aerodrome for the benefit of the infant military aviation; and in 1915, the Seville City Council ceded the hippodrome to the State for the construction of a military aerodrome. In 1915, Colonel Vives moved to Cartagena to choose the place where the first Spanish maritime aerodrome was to be established, the Los Alcázares Hydro Base, with a commission being appointed to travel to North America to choose the material that should be acquired to found a seaplane pilot school. Suddenly, he was removed from command of the aeronautics, leaving behind his management an indelible mark of creation and effectiveness. Immediately after his dismissal, he was appointed head of the General Command of Engineers of the IV Military Region, a position he took office on 19 October, and one that corresponded to the position of general, but he held it as a colonel with a higher rank.\nIn March 1917, for war merits, he was promoted to brigadier general, and was again assigned to the Peninsula, to take command of the General Command of Engineers of Zaragoza. When the Military Railway Service was created in 1920, General Vives was appointed its director. His work in this position, although brief, was fruitful. He established the foundation of an organization that remained unchanged until April 1931. In September, he joined his new position as inspector of the Engineering Services in Africa, and in this destination, one of the most active and fruitful stages of the general's life will take place.\nIn the territory of Melilla, when the Annual disaster occurred (July 21), there were no military railways, nor troops of this specialty, and furthermore, the scarce civil network remained in the power of the enemy. With all the speed that the available elements allowed, railway communications were reestablished until they were synchronized with the advance of the troops, using armored trains that provided excellent services. One can end this stage of his life by saying that the railroads, the roads, and the successes of military transmissions are due to him. The services provided by the Engineers in the Melilla Field were due to him.\nUpon being promoted to major general in 1921, he was assigned to Cartagena as military governor. He remained in this position until mid-1923, when he was appointed head of the General Command of Melilla. General Vives once again has the Aviation Forces under his command. Between the years 1917 and 1923, Vives was living in Africa (Ceuta and Melilla), in Zaragoza and Cartagena, holding different military positions.\n\n\n== Writting career ==\nVives was also a publicist, and as such, he directed several technical studies, directed military works (in the Pyrenees, Lleida, Cuba, Morocco), including the First Melillan campaign in 1893.\nBetween 1886 and 1935, Vives published 14 works of different types and themes, related to ballooning, aeronautics, meteorology, Igualada, Et cetera.\n\n\n== Politic career ==\nBosch began his political career around 1873\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 20 January 1885, while still in Lérida, Vives married his girlfriend from his cadet years in Guadalajara: Inocencia Camino Molina, and the couple had eleven children were born and fifty years later they were able to celebrate their golden wedding in Madrid.\n\n\n== Death ==\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, Vives was in Madrid, and became a refugee in the Norwegian embassy, where he died on 9 March 1938, at the age of 80.\nIn his honor Igualada has held different events. In 1925 he was named the Favorite Son of the city of Igualada, and the street that until then had been called Rambla de Sant Pere Mártir was named Rambla General Vives. To commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth, he erected a monument to him in Paseo Verdaguer. He has also inscribed his name on a tombstone in the Town Hall and named a Secondary School after him.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pedro Chillida Aramburu (24 November 1889 – 1956) was a Spanish military man who served as the second president of football club Real Sociedad between 1942 and 1945.\nHe was the father of the famous sculptor Eduardo Chillida, notable for his monumental abstract works.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nPedro Chillida graduated from the Toledo Infantry Academy in 1909. He participated in the first phases of the Rif War in which he was decorated several times, having at that time the rank of first lieutenant.\nChillida belonged to the ultra-Catholic group Basque Right (DVA), which since the founding of the Second Spanish Republic conspired to return the monarchy. The infantry captain Pedro Chillida was one of the leaders who organized paramilitary groups for the coup, being one of the four men who organized the Coup d'état of 18 July 1936 in San Sebastián, which was neutralized by the anarchists, and the failure of the coup attempt was such that by noon of that same day, Chillida's group, made up of DVA and Renovación Española militants, had dissolved and its members tried to return to their daily lives so as not to be identified as coup plotters. However, on July 20, those loyal to the Republic took Chillida prisoner, being in the Ondarreta prison until 9 September when he was transferred to Bilbao aboard the prison ship Arantzazu-Mendi, remaining there until 14 December when he was transferred to the Carmelo prison in Bilbao. On 19 June 1937, Bilbao was liberated by the troops of Franco, and Chillida surrendered to the military authorities of San Sebastián.\nOf conservative ideology, at the end of the Spanish Civil War, he was appointed by the Franco authorities as a member of the classification commissions for prisoners of war in Catalonia. Chillida was a red hunter until he retired in 1951, he even became a military judge in unfair trials held in the first post-war months in Catalonia, where he decided whether the accused should die or not. In May 1939, he was reinstated to active service with the rank of commander.\nPedro Chillida reached the rank of army commander during his military career.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nChillida took over the presidency of Real Sociedad after the resignation of Francisco Molins in 1942 following the club's relegation to the Segunda División. Chillida's first measure as president was to call a coach who knew the club perfectly, Benito Díaz, who was in France training FC Girondins de Bordeaux. Thanks to Díaz, Real Sociedad returned to the First Division on the following year, achieving direct promotion along with Sabadell. However, the following seasons were not good for the club, being relegated again in the 1943–44 season: with 17 points in 26 games, Sociedad was one victory away from forcing promotion, but was relegated as second to last. On this occasion, the stay in the Second Division was going to extend for the following three seasons, and Chillida resigned as a result of the failed promotion in 1945, being replaced as president by Felipe de Arteche, but Díaz continued at the helm of the team and went on to achieve the promotion two years later.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nIn 1922, being a captain and stationed in the 14th \"America\" ​​infantry regiment, whose garrison was located in Navarre, Chillida requested a marriage license to marry Carmen Juantegui from San Sebastián. The family settles in Plaza Zaragoza in San Sebastián, next to the Hotel Biarritz, property of Carmen Juantegui's family. This is where the couple's three children were born, including the famous sculptor Eduardo Chillida, born in 1924, and Gonzalo Chillida, a painter born in 1926.\nChillida died in 1956, at the age of either 66 or 67.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pedro Pablo Areso Aramburu (29 June 1911 – 1 December 2002) was a Spanish footballer who played as a defender for Real Betis and FC Barcelona in Spain, and for Tigre and River Plate in Argentina. He also played for the Spanish national team on three occasions in 1935.\nAs a manager, he took over teams in Spain, Portugal, Venezuela, and Chile, including RCD Espanyol in 1963–64.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nPedro Areso was born on 29 June 1911 in Ordizia, Gipuzkoa. After playing for a few years in his hometown teams, Villafranca de Oria, and then Barakaldo CF, Areso moved to Tolosa, where he played for Tolosa CF in the 1928–29 season. There, he stood out as a great defender and thus caught the attention of the many scouts who were fishing in the Basque youth academy in those years, with Real Murcia acquiring his services in the summer of 1930, along with his partner in the Tolosa defense Gabriel Andonegui.\nAreso was signed by Real Betis in October 1932, making his debut a few days later, on 12 October, in the 1932–33 Mancomunado Centro-Sur regional championship against CD Nacional de Madrid at the El Parral field in Madrid. He adapted to the Betis defense very quickly, becoming an undisputed starter and thus playing in all of the remaining official matches of the season. He was fast and forceful and always stood out for his maturity and understanding of the game. The following year, goalkeeper Joaquín Urquiaga and defender Serafín Aedo joined Betis, thus forming the famous defensive triplet that was the basis of Betis' historic league title in 1934–35, conceding a mere 7 goals in the entire tournament. In his 3 seasons at Betis, Areso played a total of 52 League games, 16 in the Copa del Rey, 26 in the Joint Regional Championship, 2 in the Andalusia Cup and 14 friendly matches.\nIn the summer of 1935, Areso was the star signing of FC Barcelona, ​​where he joined coach Patrick O'Connell, but the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 put a premature end to his career at Barça. During his short time there, the central defender became known in Barcelona as l'Stop.\nDuring the civil war, Areso played for several teams in Argentina and Venezuela, such as Tigre (1938), Racing de Avellaneda (1939–40), River Plate (1941), C.D. Vasco (1942–45) before returning to Spanish football in 1945, where he played a season for both Racing de Santander and Gimnástica Burgalesa, finishing his career with his hometown team. In his last years, he combined the position of footballer and coach.\n\n\n== International career ==\nOn 24 January 1935, Areso made his debut with the Spanish national team in a friendly match against France at the Chamartín, playing in defense alongside his club teammate Aedo, and together they kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 win. Never before and never since have two Betis players debuted together in the national team in the same match. He went on to play a further two matches for Spain, both being friendlies in 1935, against Portugal in Lisbon (3–3) and then Germany in Cologne (1–2).\nOn 1 January 1936, Areso earned his first and only international cap for the Catalan national team in a match against Andalusia at the Nervión in Seville, featuring in defense alongside Ramón Zabalo in a 1–5 loss.\nDuring the Civil War, Areso and Aedo were part of the Basque Country national team that was organized by the Basque government of José Antonio Aguirre to play various friendly matches in Europe and later in America. After the end of the tour, he settled in Argentina and returned to Spain in 1945, while Aedo stayed forever in Mexico.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nAreso began his managerial career at the helm of Racing de Santander in 1946, at the age of 35. He then took charge of Gimnástica Burgalesa in the Tercera División, replacing Florentino Florenza. He then moved to neighboring Portugal, to take charge of Atlético de Portugal, a first division team that was in a delicate situation, but Areso managed to put together a homogeneous, magnificent team, which rose to third place, so he received tempting offers from Benfica and Belenenses, but Atlético did not let him leave.\nAfter Portugal, Areso went on to coach teams in Venezuela and Chile. In the later, he guided La Serena to the 1961 Copa Chile. In 1963, he was hired by RCD Espanyol as a technical director, where he formed a tandem with Alejandro Scopelli, but due to poor results he did not even finish the 1963–64 season.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nAreso was a central character in the Basque novel Ez dadila eguzkia sartu (Let not the sun go down).\nAreso died on 1 December 2002, at the age of 91.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

While studying in Barcelona, he joined the ranks of Espanyol, making his debut in a match against Sant Gervasi, on a day when an unusual formation was presented. Together with Ángel Ponz, Gustavo Green, Emilio Sampere, and the three Joaquins (Escardó, Carril, and García), Belauste was part of the team that won the first edition of the Catalan championship in 1903–04.\nAstigarraga was also a player of the Athletic Club in the 1905–06 season, and then again in the 1914–15 season, and president of the club in the 1910–11 season, and then again between 1917 and 1919.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nIn 1918, Astigarraga was elected councilor of the Bilbao City Council, which recognized his work by awarding him the town's gold medal. In 1941 he was appointed president of the Official College of Physicians of Bizkaia. He collaborated in various medical journals and attended several International Congresses. He also appeared as a member of the International Society of Gastroenterology and presided over both the Vizcaya Pro-Cardiacos Foundation and the \"Juan Urrutia\" Pension and Retirement Fund.\n\n\n== Death ==\nZarraoa married María del Rosario Vicenta Urigüen y Gallo-Alcántara. He was the great-grandfather of Andrés Merello, from the RCD Espanyol's Communication Department.\nHe died in Bilbao on 9 September 1965, at the age of 83. A street was named after him.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nRCD Espanyol\n\nCatalan championship:\nChampions (1): 1903–04\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPresidents at Athletic Bilbao official website",

        "content": "Athanasius Sakharov was a Russian Orthodox saint and hymnographer, canonized in 2000.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSaint Athanasius Sakharov, birth name: Sergei Sakharov,was born on 2 July 1887, he was born in the Tsarevka Village in the Tambov Governorship. Throughout his early life Saint Athanasius and his family lived in the Russian city of Vladimir. Athanasius’ father,  Gregory Zakharov, was a civil-ranking Court Councillor, whilst Athanasius’ mother, Matrona, was from a peasant family.\n\nUnfortunately when Athanasius was 1+1⁄2 years old, his father, Gregory Zakhorov died. After Athanasius’ father's death, Matrona's piety increased and she took on the monastic lifestyle, which greatly influenced Athanasius’ spiritual life. During this period, the boy was very keen on attending lengthy Church Services and Liturgies. Even though he was young Saint Athanasius considered himself a servant of the church and told all his friends and classmates his dreams to achieve priesthood. Impressively at a young age, Athanasius learned how to sew, which he used his skill to sew many Church vestments and he embroider many icon coverings.\n\n\n== Education ==\nAthanasius Sakharov found his education difficult, he didn't slacken his efforts, but unexpectedly at the end of the school year he graduated at the top of the class. Impressively, at the age of 12 he wrote his first troparion to the Shuisk-Smolensk icon of the Mother of God.\n\nAfter finishing his Primary Education, Athanasius entered a religious seminary in his hometown Vladimir. As a religious seminary student, Athanasius displayed a talent at ignoring temptations. A clandestine chapter of the seminary ended, when one of its leaders died due to mishandling explosives. In the summer of 1901, revolutionary seminary students held a secret meeting later resulting in a riot amongst the students in December, when they went on strike refusing to attend the seminary. During this period, Athanasius was not interested in boycotting the seminary due to his refusal in taking part in Politics. Eventually after graduating the Vladimir Seminary, he transferred to the Moscow Religious Academy. During his stay at the Moscow Academy, he took on a monastic tonsure taking the name Athanasius after the famous Saint Athanasius of Alexandria. In 1912, Athanasius graduated the Moscow Academy with a degree in theology.\n\n\n== References ==",

They were ineligible to compete at spring championship events as they had not attained their technical minimums through international competition in the fall.\n\n\n=== 2023–24 season ===\nVäänänen and Clerici began their season with the goal of attaining their ISU technical minimum scores to be eligible to compete at the 2024 European Championships and the World Championships. The team mearned their minimums during their international debut at the 2023 Lombardia Trophy, where they finished in seventh place. Following the event, Clerici commented, \"We are really happy to have reached the technical point limits for the European Championship and the World Championship... Next we will focus on the levels and the quality of the elements in order to increase our points.\"\nAt their next event, the 2023 Finlandia Trophy, Väänänen and Clerici were warmly received by a home audience.

        "content": "Taiyi, also known as Donghuang Taiyi, is a Chinese deity and associated with the Polaris  in ancient Chinese astronomy. He was the highest deity of certain Pre-Qin and Han dynasties and was worshiped as the emperor of the heavens. In philosophy, Taiyi is a symbolism of the  Tao, or the origin of the universe. During the period of Emperor Wu of Han, worship of Taiyi was an official belief, ranked above the Wufang Shangdi and worshipped by the Emperor himself. \n\n\n== The Deity Taiyi ==\nTaiyi is regarded as the god of the Polaris, the most honored star god in folk beliefs, and is called Donghuang Taiyi in the poetry of Chuci.   In Sima Qian's “Records of the Grand Historian it’s stated that “Zhongguang  , the star of the heavenly pole, whose one is bright, is also the permanent residence of Taiyi”.   Late Han Dynasty writer Zheng Xuan wrote that  “Taiyi : the name of the God in the Polaris (Beichen). He lives there and is called Taiyi.”  Zhang Shoujie  wrote in the Tang Dynasty: “Taiyi, another name of  the Tiandi”.\nTaiyi manipulates good and bad fortune in the human world. The Weishu  writes: “Taiyi is the master of wind and rain, water and drought, war and revolution, famine and plague” . By worshipping Taiyi, one can invoke the gods and goddesses. During worship, the faithful entertained the gods with songs and dances.\nTaoism in the Han Dynasty also worshipped Taiyi, and at the end of the Han Dynasty, the Taoist fraction known as the  Taiping Dao honored Taiyi. Cultivators of the Tao medicate about Taiyi. One of its foundational texts, the Taipingjing, writes  “Entering the room to contemplate the Tao...... is the way to ascend to Taiyi from Heaven.”  Taiyi was also transformed into one of the Shenshen deities of Taoism.\n\n\n== Donghuang Taiyi ==\nDonghuang Taiyi (Chinese: 东皇太一; pinyin: Tàiyī Shēngshuǐ; lit. 'Taiyi Gave Birth to Water') is the name of the opening hymn of Chuci’s Jiuge, a collection of ceremonial hymns for the Chu Dynasty Emperor.  It describes the worship of Donghuang Taiyi. Although it's never specified whether Donghuang is a title or a name, many modern depictions use it as his surname.\n\n\n== Taiyi Creates Water ==\nTaiyi Shengshui (Chinese: 太一生水; pinyin: Tàiyī Shēngshuǐ; lit. 'Taiyi Gave Birth to Water') is an ancient Chinese text written around 300 BC during the Warring States period. It is part of the Guodian Chu Slips.\nIt is a Taoist creation myth. According to the transcription and translation by professors Wen Xing and Robert G. Henricks of Dartmouth College, the opening lines are:\n\n太一生水，\n水反輔大一，\n是以成天。天反輔太一，是以成地。\n天地（復相輔）也，\n是以成神明。\n神明復相輔也，\n是以成陰陽。\nThe Great One (Taiyi) gave birth to water.\nWater returned and assisted Taiyi,\nin this way developing heaven. Heaven returned and assisted Taiyi, in this way developing the earth.\nHeaven and earth [repeatedly assisted each other],\nin this way developing the \"gods above and below.\"\nThe \"gods above and below\" repeatedly assisted each other,\nin this way developing Yin and Yang.: 123 \n\nThe Taiyi Shengshui was written on 14 bamboo strips and was discovered among the Guodian Chu Slips in 1993 in Hubei, Jingmen, and has not been discovered anywhere else. The text's inclusion in the Guodian \"Laozi C\" bundle has led some scholars to suggest it may have been considered part of the Tao Te Ching.: 8 \n\n\n== Historical Status ==\nIn 133 BC, the fangshi Miuji (cn: 谬忌) proposed that Taiyi was positioned above the Five Emperors.  The Emperor Wu of Han took his advice and began worshipping Taiyi as the foremost deity.   \nThis was opposed by many Confucians, who believed that Huangtian Shangdi (Chinese: 皇天上帝; pinyin: Huángtiān Shàngdì)  was the foremost deity. In 5AD, the Emperor Ping of Han declared that Taiyi was the Huangtian Shangdi and began to refer to him as the Huangtian Shangdi Taiyi (Chinese: 皇天上帝泰一; pinyin: Huángtiān Shàngdì Tàiyī)   .   Later Han Dynasty national-level ceremonies kept the status of the Shangdi but began to drop Taiyi, instead of only worshipping Huangtian Shangdi as the supreme deity. Taiyi fell in status and was often worshipped among other lesser deities. \nDuring the Tang and Song Dynasties, Taiyi was once again worshipped in official ceremonies.\n\n\n== Shangyuan Festival Traditions ==\nRegarding the origin of the custom of hanging lanterns at the Shangyuan Festival or Yuanxiao Festival, there have been various theories. One is the honoring of Donghuang Taiyi by the Emperor Wu of Han.  Song Dynasty text “Qu Wei Jiu Wen 曲洧旧闻” wrote “On the Shangyuan lights: The Tang Dynasty inherited the custom from the Han Emperor's honoring of Taiyi by lighting his temple from dusk to dawn.” \nThe name Shangyuan might have also came from the Taoist honoring of it is because in Taoist thought, the Lantern Festival lanterns are lit in order to worship the Shangyuan Tianguan, or Heavenly Officials.\n\n\n== Depictions in Art ==\nIn the state of Chu ,  Taiyi was depicted as half-beast with a double-feathered mianguan, a loong under each limb, and stepping on the moon on one foot and the moon on the other. \nOlder Han Dynasty carvings show him as partially or full beast, often with a serpent-like body next to Nvwa and Fuxi. Since the Han Dynasty, Taiyi was mostly depicted as a fully clothed human. \nOther famous depictions of him include Jiuge Illustrations (circa 1356 AD ) by Zhang Wo and Lisao Illustrations by Xiao Yuncong.\n\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nIn the animated series The Legend of Qin, Donghuang Taiyi is the leader of the Yin-Yang school.\nIn the mobile game Honor of Kings, Donghuang Taiyi is a playable character\nIn the mobile game Dislyte, playable character Chu Yao gains the powers of Donghuang Taiyi.\nIn the mobile game Honkai: Star Rail, the godlike aeon Eon is called Taiyi in Chinese.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bremer TS Neustadt (officially known as Bremer Turn- und Sportgemeinde Neustadt von 1859 eV) is a sports club located in Bremen, in the Bremen-Neustadt district. The club was formed on January 1, 1972, as a result of the merger between Bremer TG and TuS Bremen-Neustadt. With twelve departments catering to various sports and music activities, Neustadt offers its members a wide range of options to pursue their interests.\n\n\n== Departments ==\nNeustadt encompasses twelve departments, including badminton, basketball, football, handball, karate, athletics, gymnastics, marching band, folklore, table tennis, gymnastics, and volleyball. The football and volleyball departments have been particularly successful in terms of the number of teams and the level of leagues.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Men's Football ===\nThe men's football team initially competed in the regional league but was subsequently relegated to the district league in 1973. After a brief stint in the association league from 1975 to 1978, they secured two consecutive promotions and gained entry into the Bremen upper house for the first time in 1980. However, the team experienced back-to-back relegations, which led them back to the district league. In 1987, they earned promotion once again and returned to the Bremen upper house, which had been renamed the Association League. In 1991, the team qualified for the newly established Oberliga Niedersachsen/Bremen after two years of battling relegation. This promotion came about due to the withdrawal of higher-placed clubs, OT Bremen and TSV Lesum.\nAlthough narrowly missing out on relegation, the team eventually returned to the top league after four years and made their mark. However, they were unable to maintain their position and were subsequently relegated again. Neustadt men's team competed in the Bremen Association League until 2004. Since their relegation in 2008, they have been playing in the Bremen district league. In the 2011/12 season, Neustadt achieved the district league championship, earning promotion to the Bremen regional league, which is at the sixth-tier level. Three years later, they were promoted to the Bremen League, marking their return to the top-tier Bremen league.\n\n\n=== Women's Football ===\nNeustadt women's football team experienced their first successes in the early 1980s. They clinched the Bremen championship title in 1983 and 1984 but were eliminated in the first round at the national level. During the same period, the team qualified for the DFB Pokal on four occasions but faced early exits. In the 1983/84 season, they suffered a 1–16 defeat against KBC Duisburg. After a prolonged period of relative insignificance, the team made a comeback to the DFB Pokal in 2006, only to face a 0–16 loss to VfL Wolfsburg in the first round. Notably, the club produced Christine Frai, a former FIFA referee.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nHardy Greens: Northern Germany – Between TSV Achim, Hamburger SV, and TuS Zeven. In: Legendary Football Clubs.

She spends several days in the open air, and then returns to the ashes. There, memories of her former happy life, of her dead husband and son roll over her like a heavy burden... In one of the barns she discovers a wounded young German soldier, Werner Bracht, whom she tries to get out, but he soon dies anyway. Involuntarily, they have to take care of the household: the four surviving cows require regular milking. It becomes a difficult test for the girl to bury the found Soviet soldier, from whose fingers she was never able to pull out his machine gun.\nWeeks and months pass, and Maria (that is the name of the survivor) is still alone in the village. From her behavior it becomes clear that she is pregnant. With the help of the cow, she harvests the rutabaga crop, storing it for the future. Winter is coming. In addition to cows and a dog, Maria's farm includes several sheep and a horse.\nOne winter day, Maria finds seven frightened children in a haystack: six girls and a boy. She takes them in, warms them up, washes them and feeds them. All of them, in different voices, tell Maria about the horrors of war: hunger, bombing, evacuation. At first there were 18 or 19 children, but only these seven reached Maria alive...\nThe spring of 1943 came. All the children already call Maria mom. One day they find the burnt remains of Mary's husband and son. The woman buries them with the help of her adopted children. Soon the time comes for Mary to give birth. Having kicked everyone out of the barn, she gives birth to a new life in a haystack, under the attentive and sympathetic gaze of her pets, under the rumble of thunder.\nSoon Maria, with a baby in her arms and seven grown children behind, goes out onto the hill to meet the Red Army troops driving the enemy back to the west.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nTamara Syomina as Maria\nValery Kokorev as husband\nAlyosha Zimovnov as son\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMother of the Human at IMDb",

        "content": "Joseph Boggs Beale (December 10, 1841 – February 26, 1926) was an American artist. He is one of the most renowned artists to work with the magic lantern.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nBeale was born on December 10, 1841, in Philadelphia, the eldest child of Louise Boggs McCord (1815–1887) and Dr. Steven Thomas Beale (1814–1899), a dentist and founder of the Pennsylvania Association of Dental Surgeons. He was also a great-grandnephew of Betsy Ross.\nHe attended Central High School, and later studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. In August 1862, he got a job as a teacher at Central High School, a position that Thomas Eakins also applied for.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBeale began as an oil painter, serving as a war artist for the 2nd Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment during the American Civil War, from June to August 1863.\nAfter the war, Beale moved to Chicago. There, he worked as an illustrator for Harper's Magazine, Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, and The Daily Graphic. In 1868, he married a woman named Mary Louise Taffart. He returned to Philadelphia after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871.\nAfter returning to Philadelphia, Beale was hired as an illustrator at Caspar W. Briggs & Sons, a seller of glass slides. He created 1,804 black-and-white paintings while working there. He created these paintings using charcoal, contrasted with ink wash painting. His paintings were usually about United States history, Bible stories, and children's literarute.\nBeale died in his home in Germantown on February 26, 1926, aged 84. An avid rower, he was the oldest member of the Undine Barge Club.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Roland Crappé or Roelant Crappé (Hindi: Reland Crepi; d 13 March 1644) was a Dutch colonial official serving the Dutch and Danish East India Company. He became director general of the Ceylonese department of the Danish East India Company in 1618 and became commander in chief and governor of Tranquebar upon his seventh arrival in the Indies in 1624. During his leadership new factories and offices were established and Danish trade went exceptionally well. He died in 1644 only a few years after his homecoming to Denmark.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAccording to Icelandic Jón Ólafsson, Roland Crappé was born of a poor Dutch family. He would early on go to sea where he acquired his first literacy. He would also make five voyages to India in Dutch service: first as a ship's boy, then as a merchant.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nIn March 1616 the Danish East India Company was founded and at approximately the same time Crappé came to Denmark. An expedition was meanwhile prepared to set sail for Ceylon to establish a Danish monopoly on the island.\n\n\n=== First expedition ===\nBecause of his previous experiences in India, Crappé was appointed director general of a new Ceylonese department of the Danish East India Company and was to leave for Ceylon with the vessel Øresund a couple of months before the rest of the Danish expedition to prepare for the arrival of admiral Ove Gjedde.\n\nCrappé arrived with Øresund on the shores of Ceylon as the first representatives of the Danish expedition in late January 1619. The king of Kandy, Senarat, demanded that Crappé campaigned against the Portuguese, and hereafter Crappé would sail up the Coromandel Coast to raid Portuguese outposts. Though he would be intercepted off Karaikal and be imprisoned by the Portuguese authorities.\nLuckily for Crappé, because of his earlier experiences, he had local contacts in the various Indian kingdoms, and he thereby got in contact with a high official of the local kingdom of Thanjavur, who helped rescue Crappé and some other of his crew. Later Crappé and 15 of his men went to the capital of Thanjavur, where Crappé allegedly had friends that could help them. Through his friends, Crappé got an audience with the Nayak of Thanjavur Raghunatha. The Nayak had seen a benefit in bonding with another European power in the hopes of weakening the Portuguese influence in his realm, and he granted the Danes the local fishing village of Tharangambadi, which they quickly renamed to Tranquebar (Danish: Trankebar). Crappé recalls the event:\n\nHere, my men, you can see how wonderfully God has helped us precisely because of our information from my good friends in Thanjavur to ask the Regnato Naicguo that the village of Trangenbari – where our office is now located – that the proceeds of this place must now be given to the poor people from Øresund\nCrappé would sent a man named Jan Peitersen to Ceylon to inform admiral Gjedde about the deal. Gjedde arrived in September 1620 and concluded a treaty with the Nayak, which promised the Handover of Tranquebar to the Danes. Despite being signed by Gjedde, the treaty with the Nayak and the subsequent territorial transfer was heavily the good work of Crappé.\nAt Gjedde's arrival at Tranquebar tensions began to arise between him and Crappé. Gjedde suspected that Crappé's intentions were in the Dutch, rather than Danish, favour, and when Gjedde left for Copenhagen in early 1621, Crappé was relieved. Crappé though soon followed after and arrived in Denmark in August the same year.\n\n\n== Second expedition and regime ==\nCrappé would again set sail for India in 1623 with Perlen, this time being commander in chief of the expedition as well as in India. On 14 March 1624, he arrived on the coast of Tranquebar and relieved the Siege of Dansborg. Crappé would be accepted as commander and he would later assume the title of general.\nCrappé would stay in India for the next 13 years. In his reign he would be an efficient leader, and already a couple of years after his accession he would establish factories in Bengal at Balasore and Pipli, yet he would not be granted favorable commercial terms by the Mughal emperor despite sending a delegation to Agra in 1626. It went better in the Sunda Islands, where Crappé would establish trading posts at Achin, Jepara, Banten, Sukadana, Banjarmasin and Makassar. These factories and trading posts would be vital for Danish trade, Makassar would even be described as a center for Danish trade by a later Dutch report.\nIn India he would establish a factory at the trading hub of Masulipatnam, which was originally an unimportant fishing village, yet in the 17th century it's commercial importance began to grow. Crappé could here trade with Arabian and Persian merchants, who specialized in textiles. Thanks to the royal support of Christian IV of Denmark, the company was able to trade in between the beforementioned trading posts, instead of relying on cargos from Europe.\nDespite of Crappé's successful attempts at establishing a far-flung string of Danish factories in Asia, the company would suffer huge financial losses, as the Nightingale got wrecked off the Coast of Bengal by a hurricane. The cargo, which had the value of 20,000 Danish rigsdaler, was also lost to the hurricane, and this would be the start of a large decline in trade, which was made evident during his successor, Bernt Pessart's, reign.\nOn the 8 November 1636, Crappé would resign of his post and head home for Copenhagen on the St. Anna, which he reached a year later.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nUpon arriving in Denmark, Crappé was entangled in a conflict with the company directors over Crappé's accounts. Though he would get support from Christian IV, who announced Crappé to be one of the three company directors in Copenhagen, and Crappé would thereby own a farm nearby. Crappé would die in Copenhagen on 13 March 1643.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDanish India – Former settlements and trading posts of Denmark and Norway on the Indian subcontinent\nOve Gjedde – Danish nobleman and Admiral of the Realm\nPeter Anker – Norwegian general, diplomat and painter (1744-1832)Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nWellen, Kathryn (2015).

        "content": "Zigzag Moderne is a substyle of the architectural Art Deco if the classification established by David Gebhard is used (Robert M. Craig would define the style simply as \"Art Deco\"). The Zigzag style was popular in the 1920s and was replaced by the Streamline Moderne in the 1930s.\n\n\n== History ==\nGebhard traces the roots of the Zigzag Moderne to the works of Bertram G. Goodhue and Eliel Saarinen, as well as  influence of the emerging International Style and the 1925 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris with its Frank Lloyd Wright's designs. He also notes the diversity of sources between the Zigzag and the succeeding Streamline style, with the latter inspired by the \"machine aesthetic\" of aerodynamic shapes.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nGebhard lists the following traits of the Zigzaq Moderne:\n\nheavy and monumental exterior forms built of smooth surfaces with window openings arranged within inset panels;\nflat roof, no Classical or Gothic termination at the top;\ncentral tower that lowers in steps to the periphery;\ndecorations consist of zigzags, chevrons, sunbursts, spirals, stylized flora and fauna.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nBleksmith lists the following examples:\n\nBullock's Wilshire Department Store (Los Angeles, 1929) by John and Donald Parkinson;\nEastern Columbia Building (Los Angeles, 1929) by Claude Beelman;\nPellissier Building and Wiltern Theatre (Los Angeles, 1930) by Morgan, Walls & Clements;\nRichfield Tower (Los Angeles, 1929) by Stiles O.

        "content": "Egg Yolkeo is the 13th episode  of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 3 December 1994.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn this parody of Pinocchio, Ren pounds eggs and wishes one of them would become his son. His wish is granted by the Blue Chicken Fairy. Ren's son, Eggyölkeo is a moron who bonds with Stimpy.  Eggyölkeo is kidnapped and Ren is deeply sad. Colonel Strombolio turns Eggyölkeo into an Elvis-like singer in Las Vegas. Ren and Stimpy go to Las Vegas to save him, but Stimpy eats  Eggyölkeo by accident with his last words being \"I love you Daddy!\" \n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nEggyölkeo-voice of Billy West\nColonel Strombolio-voice of Billy West\nChicken-voice of Harris Peet\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe production of the episode is \"notorious for its descent into utter chaos\". Stephen DeStefano stated: \"That was going to be my Ren & Stimpy masterpiece. And once it was finished, I realized it didn't really work as a cartoon or as a storyboard\". The story was intended to be half an hour long, but the network insisted on cutting its running time to 11 minutes, which threw the production into chaos and led to a story that makes little sense. The episode was illustrated by the Wang Animation studio in Taiwan whose work was not up to the standards of other sub-contractors on The Ren & Stimpy Show such as the Carbunkle studio or the Rough Draft Korea studio, with a notable decline in quality.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American critic Thad Komorowski rated the episode one star out of five. Komorowksi wrote that Egg Yolkeo was an unfunny and confusing story that was very difficult to watch and enjoy.\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G. Michael (2015).

        "content": "François Frix Michelier (8 February 1887 – 23 May 1966) was a French admiral who served in both World War I and World War II. He is best known for commanding French Naval forces during the Naval Battle of Casablanca.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn 1907, Michelier enrolled in the French Naval Academy at the age of 20. During the First World War, he held several commands and functions; Most notably, he was briefly a liaison and intelligence officer with the Royal Navy.\nOn 10 November 1928 Michelier was promoted to the rank of Frigate captain. He was promoted to deputy director of Military Personnel of the Fleet at the Ministry of the Navy and Colonies. Then on 6 March 1938 Michelier was appointed to vice-president of the French Navy technical committee and as  president of the higher shipwreck commission. He was then assigned as head of fleet construction for the French Naval Ministry.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nOn 29 September 1939 Michelier was promoted to Major General of the Navy. He then became the Secretary General of the Ministry of the Navy on 18 June 1940. During the Battle of France, Michelier along with most of the French Naval general staff were captured by the German Army in the town Rochefort. The general staff were released shortly after their capture and Michelier became a member of the French delegation to the German Armistice Commission on 1 July 1940. Later in July 1941 he became the interim president of the comminison. On 25 March 1941, Michelier was promoted to squadron vice-admiral. He was then made commander of the vichy naval forces station in Morocco and as commander and chief of the Atlantic theater of operations. He arrived in Morocco on 20 October 1941. He was placed under the direct command of the Vichy French Ministry of the Navy for all naval operations. Michelier was also placed under the command of Residents-General of Morocco Charles Noguès and served as commander of the Casablanca-Rabat sector.\n\n\n=== Allied landings in North Africa ===\nMichelier was warned of the upcoming Allied landing in Morocco by General Antoine Béthouart. However, Michelier and Noguès give no credibility to the information given. He informs Noguès (who also received information from Béthouart) of the lack of confirmation of this potential Allied operation, while nevertheless knowing that a convoy is passing Gibraltar towards the east. After the landing on the 8th, Michelier coordinated the defense and did not stop the fire until 11 November. He continued resisting even after receiving a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief of the French Armed Forces Admiral François Darlan to stop resisting. Michelier believed that Darlan was already captured thereby invalidating him from issuing orders. Additionally, Michelier had received orders from Darlan two weeks earlier that he was to hold out until the end if the allies attacked. He also received information from Admiral Gabriel Auphan that Vichy French leader Marshal Philippe Pétain wished for Michelier to resist an allied invasion to his full capacity if one were to occur.\nAfter the ceasefire, Michelier was more cooperative with the Allies, even wishing to repair both Allied and French damaged ships to resume fighting against the Germans. Under Darlan's orders, he retained the role commander in chief of the navy in the Atlantic. However, after Darlan's death, he was dismissed from his position and placed on leave that June. After clashes with Admiral Philippe Auboyneau in May, Free French leader Charles de Gaulle requested his replacement; Michelier was relieved of his duties on 7 July 1943 and was automatically retired in December of the same year.\n\n\n== After the war ==\nMichelier was brought before a French court on the charges of treason, but he was able to get case dismissed on the grounds he was carrying out the orders of the Admiralty. He testified during Noguès treason trial before the French High Court. Michelier died in 1966 in Toulouse.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Andrey Andreyevich Borzenko  (Russian: Андрей Андреевич Борзенко; December 4, 1920, Tashkent, USSR —  February 21, 1993, Tashkent, Uzbekistan) was a  Soviet boxer, Honored Trainer of Uzbekistan, Master of Sports, referee, two-time heavyweight boxing champion of the Uzbek SSR (1938, 1939).\nThe prototype of the main character of Georgy Sviridov’s novel The Ring Behind Barbed Wire.\n\n\n== Biograрhy ==\nBorzenko was born in Tashkent in 1920.\nHe began boxing in the Sidney Jackson section in the mid-1930s. Twice, in 1938 and 1939, he won the heavyweight boxing championship of the Uzbek SSR.\nHe was called up to serve in the artillery unit of the Red Army on September 24, 1941, with the rank of Red Army soldier. Participated in hostilities and was wounded twice. He was captured during the retreat of Soviet troops across the Dnieper in 1941.\nAt first he was kept in a prisoner of war camp near Dresden, and after two escape attempts he was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp.\nThe German officer who selected athletes for the Buchenwald amateur ring from among the newly arrived prisoners, having learned about Borzenko's sports past, forced him to participate in exhibition boxing fights for the entertainment of the camp staff. In total, before his liberation on April 11, 1945, Borzenko fought more than 80 fights in Buchenwald, winning all of them.\nAccording to his son, after his release he served for some time in Smersh.\nAfter the Great Patriotic War he returned to Tashkent. He graduated from the Tashkent Medical Academy, became a surgeon, and worked at the City Clinical Hospital No. 6 of Tashkent.\nHe was married and had two children   a son, Andrey, and a daughter, Olga.\nAndrey  Borzenko died in 1993. He was buried at the Botkin Cemetery in Tashkent.\n\n\n== In culture ==\nBorzenko did not talk about his stay in the Buchenwald concentration camp for a long time. However, Georgy Sviridov, a writer and the first head of the USSR Boxing Federation, who had personally known Borzenko since 1947, persuaded him to make his life story public. In the book The Ring Behind Barbed Wire  (1960), Sviridov wrote the heroic image of Andrey Borzenko (in the text of the book   Burzenko)   an active participant in the anti-fascist underground of Buchenwald, forced to enter the ring to stop beating defenseless comrades and give the underground members the opportunity to collect and test weapons.\nIn 2022, the documentary film  Borzenko: Ring Behind Barbed Wire  was released (directed by  Aleksey Degtyarev and  Elena Moshtal-Geladze, narrated by Sergey Garmash).\n\n\n== See also ==\nHarry Haft\nSalamo Arouch\nVictor Perez\nSzapsel Rotholc\nJohann Trollmann\nTadeusz Pietrzykowski\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nЛегенда из Бухенвальда.

It connects with another Portal, both capturing and displaying a livestream of each other. It was designed by Vilnius Gediminas Technical University's engineering department as a reference to the wheel of time.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to Portal creator Benediktas Gylys, the project began as a concept in 2016 \"after a mystical experience.\" Through his Benediktas Gylys Foundation, Gylys partnered with Vilnius Gediminas Technical University to develop the first two sculptures in the series, which were placed in Vilnius, Lithuania and Lublin, Poland on 26 May 2021.\nOn 8 May 2024, another two installations in the series were placed in New York City and Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin City Council presented its cities' Portal, which is located on O'Connell Street. The New York City Portal was placed at the Flatiron South Public Plaza.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Starve until you are honest (original German: Hungern bis ihr ehrlich seid) is an ongoing hunger strike and camp in Berlin, Germany in mid‑2024 that also serves as a meeting point for climate activists.  The hunger strikers are calling on German Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz to recognize the severity of scientific consensus on climate change by issuing an official policy statement [Regierungserklärung] that reacts accordingly.\nThe hunger strike itself began on 7 March 2024 but was preceded by other events.  The protest camp was erected on 25 March in Spreebogenpark, Berlin — in view of the German chancellor's residence or Bundeskanzleramt.  On 29 April 2024, the camp was required to move to Invalidenpark, Berlin.\nEstablished media are reporting that some of the hunger strikers are entering life‑threatening states through lack of nutrition.  The longest striker has been without food for approximately 67 days.\nAs of 13 May 2024, the protest action remains active.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 26 February 2024, activists blocked an intersection in Siemensstadt, Berlin in front of the de:Heizkraftwerk Reuter West coal‑fired CHP power station.  The start of the campaign alliance Hungern bis ihr ehrlich seid was announced on that day.  On 1 March 2024, the alliance confronted Transport Minister Volker Wissing with the negative effects of current transport policy on the climate at an event in Karlsruhe.  On 7 March 2024, representatives of the alliance handed over a letter with their demands to Olaf Scholz at the Federal Chancellery in Berlin.  That handover was accompanied by a symbolic protest in which activist Wolfgang Metzeler‑Kick stood on a block of ice with a noose around his neck in front of the Federal Chancellery.  This protest was intended to illustrate the urgency of the climate crisis.  On that same day, Wolfgang Metzeler-Kick became the first activist to commence an indefinite hunger strike.\n\n\n== Demands ==\nThe strikers and their supporters (also \"campaign alliance\" or \"alliance\") are calling for a government declaration by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz in which four aspects of the scientific consensus on climate change must be recognized.\nThe campaign alliance has formulated these points and refers to scientific publications, including by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its justification.  The threat to human civilization from the climate crisis, the CO2 content in the air and the need for political change are to be named.  The alliance is not pursuing other goals.  According to the alliance, the hunger strike will end the moment the federal government issues a declaration in line with these demands.\n\n\n== Evolution of the protest ==\nAs of 11 May 2024, four activists from the action alliance are on hunger strike.\nOn 24 March 2024, activists from Hungern bis ihr ehrlich seid held a vigil in front of the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe. Germany. They referred to the judgement of the Federal Constitutional Court made three years earlier to that day that the temperature limits set in the Paris Climate Agreement are constitutionally binding, and called for a climate policy that conforms to the constitution.\nThe alliance has been running a protest camp since 25 March 2024.  In the first weeks, it was located in Spreebogenpark in the government district, near to Paul Löbe Haus and the Bundeskanzleramt.  The camp then moved to Invalidenpark, some 15 minute away by foot.  The reason for this relocation was the expiry of the previous notice of assembly, as a de:fan mile was planned in the immediate vicinity of the first location as part of the European Football Championship celebrations.\n{  The climate activists demonstrated this relocation with so‑called \"slow walks\" through the government district, while some protesters wore skeleton costumes.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Political reactions ===\nDeputy government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann said on 3 April 2024 that Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz was concerned that people had gone on hunger strike.  Government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit stated at a press conference on 8 April 2024 that the government would not respond to the individual demands of the campaign alliance.\nFerat Koçak, a state politician from Die Linke party and member of the Berlin House of Representatives, declared his solidarity with the alliance on 18 April 2024.  Three days later, Koçak published a video statement on his social media profile in support of the demands of Hungern bis ihr ehrlich seid and called for an urgent change in climate policy.\nMaiken Winter, district councillor for the Ecological Democratic Party in Weilheim-Schongau, supports the campaign's demands  and organised a vigil in front of the Landratsamt Weilheim to draw attention to the demands of the hunger strikers.  She also published an interview on her YouTube channel with her brother Michael Winter, who was the third activist to go on indefinite hunger strike on 16 April 2024.\n\n\n=== Reaction from scientists ===\nNotable scientists who have publicly supported the hunger strike include climate researcher Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, geophysicist Bernhard Steinberger, and physicist Eicke Weber.\nScientists active in Scientist Rebellion also support the demands of hunger strikers.  Over 30 people joined the symbolic protest of solidarity fasting and abstained from food for two days at a time.\nOn 6 May 2024, Scientists for Future Germany published a statement on the demands of the hunger strikers.  And note that the demands for a government declaration on climate protection are \"scientifically sound and reasonable\".  But more than 100 signatories declared that, while they share and support the campaign's concerns, they judge a hunger strike to be an \"inappropriate form of protest\".\n\n\n=== Reaction by civil society ===\nIn March 2024, 18 local groups of Parents for Future sent an open letter to German Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in which they took up the demands of the hunger strikers for a government policy statement and called on the Federal President to bring this to the attention of the Federal Chancellor.\nPsychologists/Psychotherapists for Future released a statement in April 2024 that it shared the demands of the climate strikers, but distanced itself from hunger striking as a form of protest.  The co‑initiator of the association, Lea Dohm, made the same statement at a campaign alliance press conference on 7 May 2024.\nIn early May 2024, the Last Generation Austria supported the hunger strikers with a vigil in front of the German Embassy in Vienna, and a demonstration in front of the Austrian Parliament.\n\n\n== See also ==\nde:Hungern bis ihr ehrlich seid – the same article in German\nScientist Rebellion – activist scientists advocating both ecological sustainability and climate protection\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhungern-bis-ihr-ehrlich-seid.de/en/ – English language website for the hunger strike, also provides background on the strikers themselves\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Powdered Toast Man vs. Waffle Woman is the 11th episode  of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show that originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on 19 November 1994.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nPowdered Toast Man accidentally ruins the business of waffle tycoon Vicky Velcro, inspiring her to vow revenge. Powered Toast Man tries to grant the wish of the sick child Little Johnny by bringing him the president of the United States and kills the president in the process. Powered Toast Man returns to the Breadbox of Solitude out of guilt.  Velcro uses a giant waffle press to transform herself into the super-villainess Waffle Woman and demands that Powered Toast Man fight her or else Little Johnny will never be allowed to watch television again.. Powdered Toast Man returns to earth to face her. During the ensuring battle, Powered Toast Man and Waffle Woman first destroy New York City, then England and finally the entire world. In the end Powered Toast Man defeats her by destroying the waffle iron and turns Waffle Woman into a pile of slime while she vows to return \"maybe\". Despite all the destruction and death caused by the battle, Powdered Toast Man is hailed as a hero for allowing Little Johnny to watch television again.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nPowered Toast Man-voice of Gary Owens\nWaffle Woman-voice of Gail Matthius\nLittle Johnny-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe story was a pilot episode for a possible spin-off series staring Gary Owens as Powdered Toast Man following the success of the 1992 episode Powdered Toast Man. Ren and Stimpy did not appear in Powdered Toast Man vs. Waffle Woman as a way to test the appeal to audiences of a story that only featured Powdered Toast Man. The episode was largely the work of the husband and wife team of Chris Reccardi and Lynne Naylor. In August 1994, Naylor who was working on the lay-outs for the episode resigned from the Games Animation studio in protest over the way that she was treated by the network. One college stated: \"She went around to each of us to personally tell us her reasons for leaving. The tight deadlines made the job too much of a hassle despite the pay. The way she put it, it was even if the studio offered a million dollars to work on the project, but the project was due on that day, the money just wouldn't be worth all the hassle\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe American critic Thad Komorowski rated the episode two stars out of five. Komorowksi wrote that \"Powdered Toast vs. Waffle Woman\" had a \"profound inanity\" and that the story made no sense.. \n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G. Michael (2015).

        "content": "The Schöningen site is a Paleolithic archaeological site in Germany, dating to around 300,000 years ago. It is best known for the Schöningen spears, some of the oldest known wooden spears, found in the \"spear horizon\", though the site as a whole covers a broader span of time.\n\n\n== Discovery and stratigraphy ==\n\nThe site was initially excavated between 1994 and 1999, after having been found at an overcast mine near Schöningen in Lower Saxony, Germany. The depositional environment is thought to have been a lakeshore, with thermoluminescence dating and uranium–thorium dating suggesting an age of the site of approximately 300,000 years ago, during an interglacial period.\n\n\n=== Spear horizon ===\nAt the so-called \"spear horizon\", referred to within the stratigraphic sequence as Schöningen 13 II-4, numerous remains of butchered horses belonging to the extinct species Equus mosbachensis have been found associated with wooden spears (the famous Schöningen spears), among the oldest known wooden spears, other wood tools, including throwing sticks likely also used in hunting, as well as split woods with pointed and rounded ends have also been found at the site. The split wood tools were likely used in domestic activities like processing hide. Other animals found in this layer do not display evidence of butchery, and likely accumulated naturally, these include: red deer, European wild ass, aurochs, steppe bison, wild boar, Irish elk, Merck's rhinoceros and the narrow-nosed rhinoceros, straight-tusked elephant grey wolves, red foxes, stoats, least weasels, and the sabretooth cat Homotherium (among the youngest records of the genus in Eurasia), with small mammals including pygmy shrews, desmans, and the European mole.\n\n\n=== Elephant butchery site ===\n\nAt layer 13 II-3, a complete skeleton of an adult female (approximately 50 year old) straight-tusked elephant was found, which were found with natural fragments of flint which have wear indicating that they were used to butcher the elephant. The site displays no evidence of hunting, and it is suggested that the elephant died of natural causes and was later scavenged by humans.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eddie Halliwell (born  1979 or 1980) is an electronic dance music disc jockey from Wigan, England, who plays techno, house and trance music. Known for his live performances he has regularly featured in the DJ Mag top 100 DJ list, and has performed several times on the BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix show.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHalliwell grew up in Wigan, England. He learnt the DJ trade as a \"bedroom\" DJ, then coming onto the scene with not only \"flawless\" mixing skills but also the reported scratching ability of a turntablist.  His first residency in Ibiza started in 2001 at Judgement Sundays.  He also went on to have a residency at Cream in the Amnesia club.  Halliwell rose to prominence mainly due to his \"lightning-wristed deck trickery\" and an ability to make \"the dance floor erupt\".\nIn January 2002 the music magazine Mixmag featured a cover CD mixed by Halliwell. The album, Bosh!, had Halliwell's high energy and \"scratchtastic\" approach and featured tracks by artists such as Marco V, Signum and Tony De Vit. In 2015 Mixmag reported it had achieved the rare level of popularity sufficient to justify a sequel.\nHalliwell has been featured several times in the DJ Mag annual top 100 DJ ranking, including being voted into the top 20 for 4 years running. In both 2005 and 2006 he was ranked #17, followed by #16 in 2007, and #19 in 2008. Mixmag magazine also rated him at #9 in its' world top DJ poll in 2009.\nHalliwell hosted regular dance music shows on BBC Radio 1 from 2005 to 2008, including co-fronting the Residency series. He has also performed DJ mixes on seven occasions for the Pete Tong Essential Mix show, including a live set from Creamfields in 2011.\nIn 2008 Halliwell released a mix album, Fire It Up, named after the club night he started. It was considered \"too hard for some\", but did showcase his talent. In 2011 he recorded the cover CD for the August issue of DJ Mag.  That same year he started the record label FIUR, and also moved into production with his debut single, \"Neon\". This was reported as a significant move as, until this point, DJing rather than production had been his \"No.1 passion\". In 2012 Halliwell released the album Toolroom Knights under Mark Knight's Toolroom record label.  The album charted at number 28 in the UK Dance Album chart and received positive critical reception with journalist Gregory Paratore stating \"it's filled with hip-hop style cuts and scratches, showing exactly why Halliwell is able to thrill fans around the world with his quick mix style\".\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEddie Halliwell discography at Discogs \nEddie Halliwell at AllMusic \nEddie Halliwell at IMDb",

        "content": "The Flood (Russian: Наводнение, romanized: Navodneniye) is a 2022 Russian drama film directed by Ivan Tverdovskiy. It is based on the 1929 short story  by Yevgeny Zamyatin.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSwimming coach Sophia and her husband Trofim take in their niece, who is an orphan. Anya, a talented young athlete, became withdrawn after the loss of her parents and stopped talking. This becomes a significant problem for the girl, she has problems communicating with peers, some of whom openly bully her. Meeting a young man named Dima from a team of guys allows Anya to feel needed by someone and become a true friend. At the same time, Sophia's relationship with Trofim is subjected to the most serious tests.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nAnna Slyu as Sophia\nSofya Shidlovskaya as Anya\nMaxim Shchyogolev as Trofim\nVlad Prokhorov as Dima\nEkaterina Steblina as Irina\nNatalya Pavlenkova as Lyudmila\nVladimir Maisinger as Stepan\nMarina Kleshcheva as Svetlana\nStasya Venkova as Christina\nUgne Zavistauskaite as Sveta Mikhailova\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nThe Flood received generally positive reviews from professional film critics.\nFilm.ru author Maxim Ershov rated the film 6 points. In his opinion, this is “a hopeless and shocking drama about a series of tragedies in one family”. Anton Fomochkin, in his review for Seans, noted: “Microcosm of “The Flood” is a damp closet, the darkness of which was sharply disturbed by the cold beam of a flashlight. Something is running and fidgeting in the light. Only the cold body of the weakest remains motionless   the one who cannot survive this closet night”.  Vasily Koretsky (Kommersant) summarizes: “The main thing in Tverdovsky’s interpretation of Zamyatin’s text is the radical destruction of all “feelings” as an apology for violence”.\nAt the same time, critic of the Rossiyskaya Gazeta publication Dmitry Sosnovsky considered Tverdovskiy's film an “impenetrable piece of dirt”, filmed “with the intent to cause maximum discomfort to the viewer not only moral, but also physical”.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Flood (1993 film)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Flood at IMDb",

Haggis is ashamed to be bald and wants hair again. Haggis discovers a leprechaun who promises to give Haggis hair on his head again, but only if Haggis passes three tests of self-control, generosity, and courage. Haggis successively fails all three tests due to his anger, greed and cowardice. The leprechaun gives Haggis a malformed head of hair anyhow, and Haggis happily runs off into the sunset where he explodes.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nHaggis MacHaggis-voice of Alan Young\nLeprechaun-voice of Billy West\nMyron-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was a pilot episode for a spin-off series staring Haggis and Ren and Stimpy did not appear in the story as way to test the appeal to audiences of a story that only featured Haggis. Chris Reccardi who created the character of Haggis directed the episode. The American critic Thad Komorowski wrote that Reccardi was talented at stylized designs, but not at comedy. The episode was illustrated by the Rough Draft Korea studio in Seoul. The scene where Haggis tosses aside a clam rather give him a quarter out of greed was censored by the network.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKomorowski rated the episode three stars out of five, writing that the story was \"amusing\".\n\n\n== Books and articles ==\nDobbs, G.

It is the burial place of the ancient Egyptian military official Pehsukher who lived in the 18th Dynasty. The monument is known to researchers since the beginning of the 19th century, but only received in 2023 a full publication. \n\n\n== Family ==\nPehsukher, with the second name Tjenenu was deputy of the king in the great arny. He is known from several sources, including a statue now in the Louvre (E 25985) His wife was called Neith.. Several other people are depicted in his tomb, but it is uncertain how they relate to the couple.\n\n\n== Tomb ==\nThe tomb of Pehsukher consists of a decorated tomb chapel and a staircase going down to the burial chamber. The burial chamber was found looted. The chapel was once decorated with paintings but they are now much destroyed. The chapel consist of a broad hall with four pillars and a long, undecorated hall behind it. Still preserved scenes in the tomb chapel include farmers working on the field and depictions of store houses.Pehsukher and his wife are making offerings and sitting in front of a table full of offerings. On one wall, there is a long, mostly religious text. Only parts of the pillars are decorated. They show most often Pehsukher sitting and other people bringing offerings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Theban tombs\n\n\n== Literature ==\nHeike  Heye (2023).

Vlospa lived for almost a decade in Nice, France where he recorded his first singles. Deeply connected to the French hip-hop culture, one of the most famous worldwide, from an early age Vlospa started working on the mix of French and Greek rap in his own unique way, which made him known first in Greece.\nThanks to his bilingual lyrics it didn't take long for him to stand out from the rest of the hip hop artists with his Spotify & YouTube singles always garnering millions of listens & views within the first few days of release. This even culminated with his first personal album \"Mektoub\" which is the perfect crossover of street style and finesse.\nSunglasses are Vlospa's trademark and he wears them at every concert and promo photo shoot, as well as in every public appearance. The “Mektoub Sunglasses”” released with Die Nasty became a hit with the popular artist's audience, resulting in their stock being sold out quickly.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nVeni Vidi Votsi (2018)\nMektoub (2020)\nMektoub 2 (2023)\n\n\n== References ==",

Ren gives Stimpy a chigger to exchange for food, which Stimpy trades to the Village Idiot for two magical singing blocks of cheese. The Village Idiot then demands that Stimpy proved his worth in a \"battle of witlessness\". Stimpy wins the cheeses via his stupidity, but Ren tells Stimpy to bury them as the cheese is not ripe. Stimpy wakes up an ogre and gives him the cheese. Ren and Stimpy try to steal the cheese, but are caught by the ogre. Stimpy trades his kidneys for the cheese. When Ren and Stimpy try to eat the cheese, the two cheese blocks turn into princesses with churning milk curds for faces, whom Ren and Stimpy are forced to marry to \"live unhappily ever after\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRen-voice of Billy West\nStimpy-voice of Billy West\nThe ogre-voice of Billy West\nThe Village Idiot-voice of Billy West\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe episode was based on various jokes by John Kricfalusi and Jim Gomez in the 1980s about a mock fairy tale.

        "content": "Jean Ébrard, seigneur de Saint-Sulpice (26 August 1519–5 November 1581) was a French noble, governor, soldier and diplomat during the latter Italian Wars and the French Wars of Religion. Born into the first family of the province of Quercy Saint-Sulpice began his military service during the reign of François I, seeing service at the siege of Boulogne in 1544. Under his successor Henri II Saint-Sulpice operated as a client of the constable Montmorency and fought at the defence of Metz in 1552 and capture of Calais in 1558. During Henri's reign he began his diplomatic role and was tasked with presenting Henri's position to the delegates negotiating the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis after a shift in the crown's position. He received a further diplomatic role securing the withdrawal of French forces from Siena as a term of the peace.\nDuring the reign of Charles IX he moved to be a patron of the queen mother Catherine. He led two further diplomatic missions, first to España and then Portugal in 1560 and 1561 respectively. In mid 1562 he replaced the bishop of Limoges as the French ambassador to España. In this role he unsuccessfully campaigned to get España to declare war on England after the latters entry into the first French War of Religion in September 1562. When España objected to the peace that the French crown negotiated with the rebels Saint-Sulpice and Catherine took the line that España should not trouble itself with French internal affairs. In the crisis over the excommunication of the queen of Navarre Saint-Sulpice relayed information of a Spanish plot against her to the French court thus aiding in its neutralisation. He counselled taking a course of caution during further disputes with España over Papal precedence and a rebellion in Corse. Throughout this period Catherine had hoped for a personal meeting with Felipe and Saint-Sulpice helped arrange this meeting which was to transpire at Bayonne in June 1565. Felipe would not participate however but rather his wife Élisabeth. His efforts to convince Felipe of the wisdom of a new royal marriage between the kingdoms was a failure. Relieved of his charge in 1565 he returned to the French court where he had been established as a conseiller d'État (councillor of state). During the second war of religion he fought at the battle of Saint-Denis. Absent from his territories in the third war of religion, his relatives endeavoured to secure the preservation of the families lands in Quercy. When the surintendant de la maison (superintendent of the household) of the king's brother Alençon died in 1569, Saint-Sulpice replaced him, and used the position to insert many of his children into Alençon's household. In this capacity he would be with Alençon during the siege of La Rochelle at which one of his sons was killed. During the fourth war of religion Saint-Sulpice engaged in internal diplomatic efforts and was tasked with the arrest of the governor of Languedoc the baron de Damville.\nAfter the death of Charles and the ascent of his brother Anjou as Henri III, Saint-Sulpice found his position in Alençon's household compromised by his rebellion. In August 1576 he departed from the role and was soon followed by his relatives. At the Estates General called as a term of the peace his eldest son Henri Ébrard was killed by one of Alençon's men. Saint-Sulpice was one of the diplomats involved in the negotiations that brought the sixth war of religion to a close in September 1577. The king subsequently tasked him with a role in the peace's enforcement. Saint-Sulpice joined with Catherine for a new internal peace effort in August 1578, crossing much of southern France in a mission that concluded with the Treaty of Nérac which established him as a commissioner for the peace in Guyenne. As a reward he was made a chevalier (knight) of the Ordre du Saint-Esprit (Order of the Saint-Esprit) the most senior order of French chivalry. He died on 5 November 1581 and was succeeded to his titles by his son Bertrand.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nJean Ébrard was born on 26 August 1519, the second son of Antoine Ébrard (–1563) and Marguerite de Lévis. He had a full brother Christophe Ébrard, the abbot of Marcilhac in Quercy. He also had a half brother Nicolas Ébrard, the sieur de Cluset from his father's second marriage, and a half sister Jeanne Ébrard who married René de Pins-Montbrun. Jean helped facilitate the marriage of his half brother to an heiress named Vignan. His father fought several times for the king but generally preferred to maintain a rural existence.\nThe Ébrard family traced the possession of their various lands between Cahors and Figeac back to the 13th century. They enjoyed relations with many important families of the region such as the Cardaillac, Gourdon, Vaillac, Lauzières, Thémines, Genouillac, Estang and Arpajon. In the late 15th century the family took advantage of litigation to increase the value of the cens (tax for usage of the land) on the grounds that the lands value was greater than it had been in prior generations. As their influence grew, so too did their social horizons, and ties were formed with the Flezins-Montmurat in Auvergne and Pins-Montbrun in Gascogne. The Ébrards were the premier barons (first barons) of Quercy through the title of baron de Saint-Sulpice.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nAntoine and his predecessor seigneurs de Saint-Sulpice had little education beyond that which prepared them for a military career. At Antoine's instigation, this changed for Jean. His son had a significant education, first at Cahors and then Toulouse. He completed his studies in 1543 at the Università degli studi di Ferrara (University of Ferrara) where he became a doctor in utroque, meaning he could practice both civil and canon law.\nSaint-Sulpice's career at court began when he was established as an écuyer (squire) of François I.\n\n\n=== Marriage and children ===\nIn 1551 (Boucher) or 1553 (Jouanna) Jean married Claude de Gontaut. This marriage fostered connections with the Biron (she was the sister of the marshal de Biron and a captain of Coligny's), Noailles, Lansac and des Cars families. The Biron were also the first family of the Périgord, making the match advantageous. Claude was a Protestant, and Saint-Sulpice adopted a position of moderate Catholicism, open to the friendship of Protestant seigneurs. Indeed, the Spanish ambassador Álava suspected him of Protestantism in 1566.\nWith Claude de Gontaut, Saint-Sulpice would have six children, among whom were:\n\nHenri Ébrard (1553–1576), comte de Nègrepelisse jure uxoris, capitaine de la chevau-légers (captain of the light-horse), married the comtesse de Nègrepelisse without issue.\nArmand Ébrard (1556–1573), seigneur de Comiac, ensigne-colonelle de l'infantrie de France (ensign-clonel of the French infantry), died of wounds sustained at the siege of La Rochelle.\nAntoine Ébrard (1559–1600), bishop of Cahors (1576), conseiller d'État (1585).\nBertrand Ébrard (1560–1587), sénéchal and governor of Quercy (1584) and Rouergue (1585), married Marguerite de Balaguier with issue, died of wounds sustained at Coutras.\nCatherine Ébrard (–1621), married the seigneur de Thémines and future marshal of France in 1587 with issue.\nIn 1566 Saint-Sulpice brought his three eldest sons (Antoine, Armand and Henri) to the prestigious Collège de Navarre in Paris, where the highest nobility in the kingdom received their education. Among the alumni of the collège were the children of the ducs de Guise, Aumale and Vendôme. Only Antoine would undertake a thorough education at the institution however, while Henri and Armand undertook the  'education of a gentleman' (music and martial pursuits - their horse riding taught to them by the tutor of the duc d'Anjou). On 12 December 1566, Saint-Sulpice presented his eldest son Henri to the king Charles. He was warmly received by the king's brothers and the king's mother Catherine.\nThe royal favour that his son Henri enjoyed allowed Saint-Sulpice to negotiate a spectacular marriage for him in 1576 with the comtesse de Nègrepelisse. The baron provided his son an income of 5,000 livres at this time. Saint-Sulpice reminded his sons of the bonds between the Ébrard family and the Lévis family and indicated a desire to see a marriage between the comte de Caylus and a member of his household.\n\n\n=== Land and income ===\nIn 1569 the seigneurie of Comiac was usurped from the Saint-Sulpice family by two Reyrevignes brothers. Saint-Sulpice entrusted his brother the abbot of Marcilhac with bringing together their allies to make the elder Reyrevignes brother understand this deed would not go unpunished. After the matter had been put before the sénéchal of Villeneuve en Rouergue the land was returned to the Saint-Sulpice. It was apparent the brothers' claim was not entirely without merit and thus they were compensated for returning the territory to the Ébrards. After this episode Reyrevignes, impressed by Saint-Sulpice's network offered himself to Saint-Sulpice's service.\nAround 1572 Saint-Sulpice's various lordships brought him revenues of approximately 12,000 livres. Beyond his lands he could count on his pension as a member of the conseil privé (3,000 livres), the incomes of his roles in the household of the king's brother Alençon (2,000 livres) and his income from governing part of the prince's appanage (1,000 livres). This totalled to 18,000 livres.\n\n\n== Reign of François I ==\n\nIn 1544 Saint-Sulpice saw service at the first siege of Boulogne in the defence against the English.\n\n\n== Reign of Henri II ==\nWhen the Scottish expedition was undertaken by France during the war of the Rough Wooing, Saint-Sulpice travelled to Scotland to fight the English.\n\n\n=== Final Italian War ===\n\nSaint-Sulpice fought under the command of the constable of France Montmorency during the Italian Wars. He saw service at the capture of Metz and was then in the city for its successful defence against the Emperor's siege later that year.\nWith the collapse of the Truce of Vaucelles in 1557, Saint-Sulpice was tasked with meeting with Felipe's ambassador Simon Renard on the kingdom's border. That same year, his patron the constable Montmorency was captured by the Imperials. Saint-Sulpice would play a role in the negotiations for Montmorency's release.\n\n\n=== Royal favour ===\nHe was established as a gentilhomme de la chambre du roi (gentleman of the king's chamber) by Henri II in 1558. This position was granted to him in survivance of his father-in-law the baron de Biron.\nHaving fought in Picardie, Saint-Sulpice participated in the successful capture of Calais from the English in 1558.\n\n\n=== Cateau-Cambrésis ===\n\nIn the evening of 14 November 1559, while peace negotiations with España were ongoing, Catherine and the duc de Guise implored Henri not to surrender French Piemonte as part of any treaty. The former denounced the constable Montmorency crying that he had always done the king evil. Henri retorted that it was rather those of the war party who had convinced him to break the 1556 Truce of Vaucelles who had done him wrong. On 15 November, Henri summoned his council and announced to the assembled grandees that he had resolved on making peace with the Spanish king Felipe even if this meant the returning of the majority of the French conquests of the Italian Wars including Corse, Piemonte and parts of Luxembourg. Only the archbishop of Vienne protested, but he was silenced. Saint-Sulpice was ordered to travel to Cercamp, where the delegates had been discussing terms of a peace to inform them of Henri's resolution.  By this means he was also to reverse the instructions given to the bishop of Limoges ordering the withdrawal of the French delegates from the negotiations. Saint-Sulpice was also to see to the return of Montmorency to the French court so that he might be reunited with Henri.\nWhile talks had been stalling at Cercamp, Saint-Sulpice's arrival so dramatically altered the position of the French delegates, that the Spanish wondered whether it was some sort of ploy. Only the matter of Calais was left as a thorn to the establishment of an agreement. Saint-Sulpice repeated Henri's position on Calais that the king would lose his crown before surrendering Calais.\nOn 6 February 1559 peace was concluded at Cateau-Cambrésis. One term of the peace the French abandoned the Sienese territory of Montalcino which had been under their 'protection'.\nSaint-Sulpice was again entrusted with a diplomatic mission by Henri on 9 July when he was sent to the French secured Repubblica di Siena riparata in Montalcino (Sienese republic which was based in Montalcino) to oversee the handover of the territory to the 'protection' of the Spanish. On 18 July word arrived of the death of Henri II, with hope quickly spreading that the French withdrawal might be reversed, however it was confirmed by the new administration.\n\n\n== Reign of Charles IX ==\n\n\n=== Catherine's man ===\n\nThough he had been in Montmorency's orbit, Saint-Sulpice became a client of the queen mother Catherine. Gellard describes him as an 'unwavering' supporter of the queen mother. His wife was established as one of her ladies in waiting. The influential position he was to enjoy derived from his relationship with her as opposed to his local authority. Haan differentiates Saint-Sulpice from the label of 'courtier' though emphasises that he endeavoured to maintain a proximity to the crown.\nIn 1560 Saint-Sulpice undertook extraordinary diplomatic missions to Madrid.\nIn the Spring of 1561, Saint-Sulpice lead an extraordinary mission to Portugal. Meeting with the Portuguese king he spent only a few weeks in the country before his return. He was then entrusted with a diplomatic mission to Provence.\nIn June 1561, while at court in Catherine's entourage, king Charles promised Saint-Sulpice the captaincy of the first compagnie d'ordonnance that became vacant. This promise was realised in the December of that year. Tied up in court, his brother, the abbot of Marcilhac, and his wife oversaw the recruitment of men for his compagnie, a process they began before the captaincy had been bestowed on Saint-Sulpice formally. Men were recruited from Gascogne, Quercy and the Toulousian provinces. The role of guidon was granted to Saint-Sulpice's son Henri. Although in the coming years he would fight in the royal armies, he would not personally lead his compagnie d'ordonnance.\n\n\n=== Ambassador ===\n\nIn June 1562 Saint-Sulpice was made the ordinary French ambassador to España. He had begun his residency in May, however there was an overlap between the end of one diplomatic tenure (the bishop of Limoges') and the start of another.\nCloulas characterises the ambassadorships of the bishop of Limoges, Saint-Sulpice and the baron de Fourquevaux as timid missions, in contrast to those of the Spanish ambassadors, Thomas Perrenot de Granvelle (known as Chantonnay) and Álava. All three French ambassadors of this period were men of experience who had enjoyed a career in which they had 'proved themselves'.\nAs ambassador to Espaňa, Saint-Sulpice would be Catherine's ninth most corresponded to diplomat during her time as queen mother. He received 54 letters from her in his residency. The French ambassadors to España would receive royal correspondence far more frequently than their Spanish counterparts in France did during the 1560s. He in turn wrote back to Catherine 93 times. It was only irregularly that Saint-Sulpice would write to the sécretaires d'État (secretaries of state), with letters to L'Aubespine and Fresne only constituting 5% of his correspondence. As ambassador Saint-Sulpice would also be in correspondence with his future replacement, Fourquevaux who told him in 1564 that if he had important matters to impart that he should write them covertly using orange juice.\nCatherine's daughter, Élisabeth, the queen of España was a useful conduit for Saint-Sulpice during his ambassadorship. She explained the king's intentions to Saint-Sulpice in May 1563 much to Saint-Sulpice's delight. Saint-Sulpice and his successor Fourquevaux would regularly consult with Élisabeth and broach the subjects they intended to discuss with Felipe prior to audiences with the king. After a very difficult pregnancy in August 1564 for Élisabeth during which it was feared that she would die, the queen's recovery induced celebrations across España. Saint-Sulpice reported on various celebratory processions, along with public and private devotions.\nAs ambassador, Saint-Sulpice enjoyed an income of 7,200 livres. Like many other ambassadors, Saint-Sulpice would make appeals to the French court asking for his relief from the charge. Such arguments were typically based on grounds of age, illness, financial ruin, and the duration of his residence. In 1564 Saint-Sulpice described his distance from Catherine and the French court as an 'oblivion'. Saint-Sulpice further complained during his residence in España that his properties were subject to attacks from Protestants.\nHe brought with him to España his cousin, a minor nobleman named La Mothe-Fénelon who served him as a courier during his residency. Saint-Sulpice continually sang La Mothe-Fénelon's praises in his despatches to Catherine during his residency. La Mothe-Fénelon would go on to be established as the French ambassador to England. In great part Saint-Sulpice relied on French couriers, and only four times referenced providing his despatches to foreign couriers. The Spanish ambassadors despatches by contrast were often entrusted to French couriers.\n\n\n=== First French War of Religion ===\n\nIn the first audience he enjoyed of his residency, Saint-Sulpice waxed lyrical about Franco-Spanish friendship. He spoke of the alliance between the two forming the basis for a 'perpetual confederation' by which god would be eternally honoured and maintained in each of their sizable territories.\nIn July 1562 Saint-Sulpice received requests from the royalist Catholics of Bordeaux who wished for Spanish reinforcements to secure their position.The lieutenant-general of Guyenne, seigneur de Monluc, future lieutenant-general of Guyenne,  and the governor of Bayonne all made such requests. The new ambassador was irritated by all the requests, complaining that 'men of war are not assembled as easily as canons in the chapterhouse'. Saint-Sulpice was not overly favourable to the prospect of relying on Spanish support, fearing that it could lead to the foreign domination of France.\nRecently established in España, Saint-Sulpice corresponded with the duc de Guise who was jointly leading the royal armies in France in September 1562. Meanwhile, the governor of Narbonne kept him appraised of developments in the war in Languedoc and Provence.\nWith the intervention of the English in favour of the Protestant rebels, Saint-Sulpice entreated Felipe to declare war on Elizabeth I. The Spanish took the opposite approach, and desisted from making protest to the English court. Saint-Sulpice was informed that England had a legitimate right to Calais as per the terms of Cateau-Cambrésis by which it was to be held by the French for eight years. It was 'clear' force of arms was the only way England was going to recover control of the port. As such England's intervention was a political and not a religious matter. The duchessa di Parma who acted as regent for Spanish Nederland would however impede the taking of war loans by the English from Antwerpen.\nSaint-Sulpice would also send around 11 official despatches to the lieutenant-general of France the king of Navarre between May and the latter's death in November 1562. Saint-Sulpice was unaware of the negotiations that had transpired for Felipe to provide Navarre a kingdom in compensation for the loss of Navarre. He reported that the situation in the Spanish court was less tense after Navarre's death.\nChantonnay, the Spanish ambassador, held suspicions as to the religious orthodoxy of the French king's brother's tutor François de Carnavalet and feared that he might imbue his 'religious deviancy' in the teachings of the young prince. He reported to king Felipe various 'horror stories' of evidence of Orléans profaning the host and other insults. Saint-Sulpice, at Carnavalet's request, assured the Spanish queen that the tutor would only instruct his charge in virtue and would not enter religious discussions with him.\nIn January 1563, Saint-Sulpice dispatched his secrétaire La-Mothe-Fénelon back to the French court to inform Catherine that Felipe was attempting to obstruct the establishment of a peace deal to end the French civil war.\n\n\n=== Peace of Amboise ===\n\nBy the end of the first war of religion, Chantonnay had adopted a more discreet posture. Meanwhile, Saint-Sulpice took on a more bold attitude in España. The duque de Alba (duke of Alba) protested the concessions made to the Protestants in the peace, but was informed by Saint-Sulpice that Catherine had restored Catholic worship in the kingdom. He was unable to convince Alba, but appealed to Felipe. There was some Spanish displeasure at the Edict of Amboise, but Felipe was overall pleased to be extricated from a complicated diplomatic situation. He thus made no open declaration of his disapproval. Saint-Sulpice reported to Catherine that Felipe had stated to him that he neither approved nor disapproved of the edict, as it was already a reality, thus there was no point dwelling on it any longer.\nIn May 1563, Saint-Sulpice affirmed with pride to Catherine that France was both the first and most important of España's allies. As a mark of the French gratitude for the Spanish support the kingdom had received during the civil war, Catherine informed the Spanish court French forces would be at Felipe's disposal if so required. Saint-Sulpice thus took the initiative in July when informed by Alba that there were 'heretics and Anabaptists' in Nederland to propose French support in their suppression. He then wrote back to the French court to get retrospective approval for his offer. Charles affirmed Saint-Sulpice's decision and asked him to make it again with his approval.\nThere was some concern about the Spanish reaction to the recovery of Le Havre by force of arms from the English. This was due to the Spanish informing Saint-Sulpice that they saw legitimacy in Elizabeth's desire to be restored to Calais. However, by the time of the siege of the city, Catholic solidarity had brought Felipe over to the French position. Thus after the city was taken on 28 July, Saint-Sulpice received Felipe's congratulations.\nAlba protested to Saint-Sulpice a little while later that the peace edict was enforced 'to the letter' for the Catholics, but not so for the Protestants. Saint-Sulpice and the French court reacted with irritation to the Spanish unease at the activities of the Protestant prince de Condé and return of the seigneur d'Andelot to his office of colonel-general of the infantry. Both parties argued that it was not correct for the Spanish crown to trouble itself so greatly with French domestic affairs.\n\n\n=== Navaresse troubles ===\nDuring September 1563, the Pope declared the queen of Navarre to be a heretic, and summoned her to appear before the inquisition. Saint-Sulpice was informed of this development by Catherine who characterised is an overstretching of the Papacies reach. Charles wrote indignantly to Saint-Sulpice that the Pope intended to usurp the French king's authority in the matter. For Charles the Pope's declaration of an inquisitorial visit was invalid and he made it clear to Saint-Sulpice that interventions in French territories from the Pope would not be tolerated. Saint-Sulpice was tasked with keeping his ear to the ground in España to understand any further developments in the situation. Felipe did indeed hold plans related to Navarre, hoping to see the queen kidnapped and delivered to the Spanish inquisition. Monluc further envisioned Felipe seizing control of Béarn from the queen of Navarre thereby uniting the destruction of Protestant power with the enlargement of the Spanish realm. At the end of November, Saint-Sulpice was informed of such a plot by the queen of España who had learned of it from one of embroiderers. Saint-Sulpice thanked both parties for their vigilance in Charles' name. Having informed Catherine of the plot she undertook energetically to the defence of Béarn. When an uprising against the queen of Navarre did begin in Oloron in December it was quickly suppressed. Some months later, Saint-Sulpice was tasked by the queen of Navarre with adapting the instructions she had given her new envoy to the Spanish court as he felt best to align with the king's affairs.\n\n\n=== Dismissal of Chantonnay ===\nDuring an audience with Felipe in December 1563, Saint-Sulpice protested virulently against the activities of the Spanish ambassador in France. Chantonnay was accused of supporting the maintenance of arms in the capital. By this means he overstepped his role as a diplomat. In February 1564 Chantonnay was recalled from France.\nSaint-Sulpice alleged that he enjoyed a close rapport at the Spanish court with the príncipe de Éboli (prince of Éboli) who favoured more harmonious relations with the French crown. Éboli thus would have supported the campaign for Chantonnay's dismissal. Felipe was not happy at the pillorying of his ambassador but turned to Álava as a replacement for the post. He was given instructions to take a softer tact, with an approach of gentleness as opposed to threatening the French crown. Felipe confided in Saint-Sulpice that he did not believe Chantonnay had malicious intentions towards Catherine and was sad he had been unable to satisfy her.\nIn December 1563, Saint-Sulpice received an appeal from the bourgeois of the Breton town of Le Croisic that he secure from the Spanish king the release of two of their number who had been condemned by the Spanish inquisition for heresy and put to the galleys. Their cause had also been a matter of concern to the previous Spanish ambassador, who made the case to the Spanish crown for their release in April 1562.\nAs ambassador to España, Saint-Sulpice was entreated by the lieutenant-general of Guyenne Monluc that he see that Monluc's reputation was maintained well in the Spanish court. He assured the ambassador that his children would be thus obligated to Saint-Sulpice.\nFrom 1563 Saint-Sulpice enjoyed membership of the royal conseil privé (privy council). In the text Discours merveilleux de la vie, actions et deportemens de Catherine de Médicis, the principal members of Catherine's government were outlined as follows: Saint-Sulpice; the lieutenant-general of Languedoc, Joyeuse; the lieutenant-general of Dauphiné, Maugiron; the governor of Narbonne, Fourquevaux; and the sécretaire d'État Villeroy.\nAs concerned a meeting between Catherine and the Spanish king, Saint-Sulpice warned Catherine in January that the more desperate for a meeting she appeared, the less keen Felipe was on seeing it come to pass. Catherine took his advice and dramatically scaled back her expressed interest in the meeting.\nÁlava offered 'general reproaches' to the French pacification policy. In opposition to his criticisms, both Catherine and Saint-Sulpice championed her grand tour of the kingdom as the tonic to France's ills. Both figures emphasised that through the full implementation of the edict of Amboise France would be bettered.\n\n\n=== Political crises ===\n\nDuring May 1564, the Pope declared that the French king enjoyed precedence over the Spanish king in the Papal court. This was justified on the grounds of the Frankish conversion to Christianity and how ancient the kingdom was. There was debate as to how to respond to this insult in España and it was agreed not to make an official response. Felipe would however recall his ambassador from Roma. Saint-Sulpice found the king's silence on the matter greatly troubling. Álava meanwhile observed the fear in the French court that despite the confirming of their privilege it was even more fragile than it had been before. As a result, Saint-Sulpice did not see fit to justify the Papal decision and the matter was left to rest. The ambassador opined back to the French court that the best approach to the situation was to take an approach of modesty. Catherine concurred.\nAround this time there was a further potential crisis between the kingdoms over the Corsican revolt of Sampiero Corso. The Spanish insisted that the French demonstrate their neutrality and Saint-Sulpice communicated to the French court his opinion that Felipe should be respected in this matter. Catherine assured the Spanish crown that French subjects were prohibited from aiding Corso. A few months later Saint-Sulpice admitted he feared the flashpoint could have caused a greater conflagration. Felipe and Alba were greatly satisfied by the speed of the French appeasement, and rewarded Saint-Sulpice with information about the Spanish fleets movements.\nIn August 1564, Saint-Sulpice received induction into the most senior order of French chivalry when he was granted the collier (collar) of the Ordre de Saint-Michel (Order of Saint-Michel). That same year he was made a gentilhomme ordinaire de la chambre du roi (ordinary gentleman of the king's chamber). The king afforded him benefit for his role in España by ordering a six-month suspension in any litigation in France concerning him on the grounds that of his Spanish residence.\nSaint-Sulpice endeavoured to gain an understanding of grand Spanish plans at sea in late 1564, but reported to the French court in June and August that he struggled to obtain clear answers from Felipe. Felipe's caginess derived from the French alliance with the Osmanlı İmparatorluğu (Ottoman Empire) and the French king's alliance with Corsican rebels.\n\n\n=== Bayonne ===\nWhen the French court reached Dauphiné during its royal tour, Catherine reminded the queen of España, her daughter of her desire for a meeting to come to pass between the sovereigns. This was a more unofficial channel of communication than through Saint-Sulpice. The ambassador had the topic of a meeting brought to him during an audience with the Spanish king and responded coldly. Thus in November it was left to the Spanish to make the move on planning the meeting.\nIn November 1564, Saint-Sulpice protested to the Spanish crown against the violation of the comté de Foix (county of Foix) by Spanish forces. The French crown's position was that the queen of Navarre's sovereignty over her lands was a different matter to her Protestantism. Saint-Sulpice also protested against the activities of the queen of Navarre's uncle the bishop of Comminges, asking Élisabeth to weigh upon her husband 'not to employ such shady characters'. The queen of Navarre for her part responded to his activities by charging her uncle with treason.\nCompeting French and Spanish expeditions were sent to Floride in early 1565. Each kingdom became aware of the other expedition and its objectives. The fraught colonial situation remained unaddressed for the majority of 1565 and Saint-Sulpice reported that there was official silence on the matter. The diplomatic storm would not break until November during the ambassadorship of Saint-Sulpice's successor.\nFrom January to March 1565, the grand tour of the kingdom resided in Toulouse. Catherine was greatly desirous to hold an interview with Felipe at this time for the purpose of arranging several royal marriages between the house of Valois and house of Habsburg. To this end Saint-Sulpice had numerous interviews with Felipe exploring the possibility. The prospect of a meeting between Catherine and Felipe had been broached to Saint-Sulpice as early as March 1562 when Toulouse was proposed as the location for such an undertaking. Saint-Sulpice communicated to the French court that Felipe had indicated his willingness to undertake  a meeting with her. Felipe informed Saint-Sulpice that if he personally was unable to meet with Catherine then his wife, the queen of España and Catherine's daughter Élisabeth would be able to meet with her. In January 1565 he announced that it would be only his wife in attendance, thus it would take the form of a discreet family reunion as opposed to a grand meeting. Saint-Sulpice secured agreement that it would occur at Bayonne.  Saint-Sulpice remained central to the negotiations for the meeting. Alongside Élisabeth, Felipe would send the duque de Alba one of his closest advisors. Alba informed Saint-Sulpice in February that it was foolish to imagine that France could emerge from its current crisis and the evils that plagued the kingdom without Spanish support.\nDuring March, Saint-Sulpice plead with the queen of España to intervene with her husband, to get him to modify his position as concerned the kingdom of Navarre. When it became apparent to Felipe that his wife and Alba might end up meeting with the queen of Navarre and the prince de Condé at Bayonne, he made it clear to Saint-Sulpice that his wife did not wish to meet with rebels and the sources of sedition. Saint-Sulpice attempted to have the prohibition on attendance limited to the queen of Navarre, Condé, Coligny and the cardinal de Châtillon, however it was made clear to him no Protestants were acceptable. Saint-Sulpice thus advised Catherine that it would be wise to take this seriously. Catherine agreed to concede to this request, though tasked Saint-Sulpice with making a new appeal to Felipe. The ambassador highlighted that the situations in France and España could not be equated and civil war was a great danger in France. He reported with great pleasure in April that all was proceeding well in España. It was only at this time that it was learned that Alba and the duque de Nájera would be in Élisabeth's retinue for the meeting. Saint-Sulpice had not been able to get any details about who was to accompany her from the French princess. In May Saint-Sulpice received a new tirade from Felipe in which he stated that Élisabeth would be disowned by the Spanish population if he acceded to such a meeting involving Protestants. Even if his wife were almost outside Bayonne, 'she would return to España if the queen of Navarre or Condé were in Bayonne'.\nAccording to Saint-Sulpice, it was key to emphasise to the Spanish queen Élisabeth that France was concerned with the preservation of Catholicism and the maintenance of peace. Élisabeth supported Felipe strongly in the importance of the destruction of Protestantism, and wrote to her mother often on this point. Felipe monitored the correspondence Élisabeth received from the French court.\nNevertheless, Saint-Sulpice was sensitive to the optics of the exclusion of Protestants from the meeting, and warned Catherine as such. Condé for his part made clear his displeasure at the state of affairs. Several weeks before the meeting Alba left Saint-Sulpice fearing that the Spanish intended to impose a new religious policy against the Protestants on the French king at the meeting. The meeting between Catherine, Alba and Élisabeth would transpire between 15 June and 2 July. On 27 July 1565 a post-Bayonne declaration would be issued. The declaration offered vague support in favour of Catholic unity, though Alba opined to Felipe that as soon as the Protestants arrived at Bayonne, Catherine's position would reverse.\nAfter the Bayonne Conference, Saint-Sulpice accompanied the Spanish queen Élisabeth back to España.\n\n\n=== Royal marriage ===\n\nBack in España, Saint-Sulpice was faced with difference of opinion between the French and Spanish crowns over the matter of princely marriages and a league against the Osmanlı İmparatorluğu. Saint-Sulpice attempted to get a firm commitment from Felipe but struggled in this regard. In the Spanish court, only Éboli was truly favourable to Catherine's proposal for a marriage between Marguerite de Valois and the son of Felipe. For Éboli the union was a perfect way to preserve the peace between the kingdoms. The príncipe dismissed Alba's coldness, highlighting that the Bayonne conference would have gone differently had he been involved. Alba made his disapproval of the project known to Saint-Sulpice. In September Felipe responded to Saint-Sulpice through Alba. The ambassador was informed that Felipe's son was to be wed to Anna von Österreich, daughter of the Emperor. As concerned an anti-Osmanlı league, it could disquiet the German princes. \nSaint-Sulpice's time as an ordinary ambassador to España came to an end in October 1565 when he was relieved in favour of the baron de Fourquevaux.\nDuring his tenure in España, Saint-Sulpice was rarely paid his wages or expenses. As such when he returned to France at the end of his term he was rewarded with several ecclesiastical benefices. His brother Christophe refused to receive the bishopric of Riez, content with his responsibilities for Marcilhac. His half brother would refuse the bishopric and an abbey, not wishing to enter a church life. Saint-Sulpice thus traded the bishopric of Riez for the abbey of Belleperche.\nArriving in Quercy on his return, Saint-Sulpice was greeted by many of the seigneurs of the region keen to offer their services to him.\n\n\n=== Man of the court ===\nFrom 1565, Saint-Sulpice would serve as one of the chambellan (chamberlain) of king Charles.\nIncreasingly devoted to affairs at the French court, Saint-Sulpice was unable to provide his attentions to his lands in the south of France. The baron had the ambition to insert several of his sons into the entourage of a royal prince, in particular the duc d'Alençon.\nSaint-Sulpice received assurances of the great friendship in which he was held by the cardinal de Châtillon. However at the same time as Châtillon was assuring him of this he was attempting to frustrate the families acquisition of the bishopric of Beauvais.\nIn August 1566, Saint-Sulpice was back in España, though this time as an extraordinary ambassador as opposed to an ordinary one.\nSaint-Sulpice still participated in military service, even during the 1560s and saw combat during the first months of the second war of religion at the royalist victory of the battle of Saint-Denis in November 1567 where he was wounded and his former protector constable Montmorency killed.\nAt this time Saint-Sulpice enjoyed a poor relationship with the young vicomte de Turenne (viscount of Turenne). Hoping to discredit Turenne, Saint-Sulpice insinuated to Catherine that Turenne was facilitating covert contact between her young son Alençon and the house of Montmorency. Such contact was seen as a threat by Catherine as it afforded Alençon a factional political role.\nDuring 1568 Saint-Sulpice was made capitaine de cinquante hommes d'armes (captain of 50 men at arms) by the king.\n\n\n=== Third war of religion ===\nDue to Saint-Sulpice's absence, his wife negotiated an agreement with the Protestant commander the baron d'Assier in October 1568 protecting the Saint-Sulpice's seigneuries from attack or occupation by Assier's men. She further negotiated with the royalist commander Monluc to secure an agreement akin to that which had been granted to the comté de Comminges. When the main Protestant army under Admiral Coligny passed through the area of the family domains, she gifted the admiral several animals, causing Coligny to note that he considered himself a friend of Saint-Sulpice, and would not trouble the Saint-Sulpice territories.\nThe following year he wrote to his wife in October urging her to 'sell off all the wheat'. During the summer of 1569, Saint-Sulpice's sister Madeleine and his brother Marcilhac wrote to François de Gontaut, one of Saint-Sulpice's brother-in-laws and a captain under the command of Coligny. They bemoaned the fact that those seigneurs on the borders of Saint-Sulpice's lands were subjecting his peasants to unbearable extortions and cruelties. After making this appeal they would next turn to another Protestant commander the comte de Montgommery, but he had other priorities than heeding their request.\n\n\n=== Alençon's governor ===\n\nIn October 1569, the surintendant de la maison (superintendent of the household) of the king's brother the duc d'Alençon  Jean Babou died. He was succeeded in this charge by Saint-Sulpice. In addition to this role he was made the governor of the duc and the head of his council. Thus he managed Alençon's property, and as governor presided over a body of 15 people at Alençon's expense.\nJust as Babou had sought to fill the ducs household with his relatives, Saint-Sulpice did likewise. His four sons were beneficiaries of his new position, as was his brother in law. His half brother was inserted into the household as a gentleman servant, while Henri and Bertrand became chambellan and gentilhomme de la chambre for the duc. It would be while in Alençon's household, that Henri and Bertrand gained their education in riding, fencing and music. In return for the 'noble education' they would entertain Alençon. Combining the value of Saint-Sulpice's pension with the salaries of his relatives in the household they drew a sum of 6,700 livres a year from the prince.\nIn addition to his own relatives, Saint-Sulpice was also able to secure promise of favour from the duc de Longueville in return for installing a client of his named La Baratte into Alençon's household as a valet.\nThough Saint-Sulpice had not sought out the office he gained in Alençon's household prior to his appointment, he quickly struck it off with the young prince, a friendship developing between the two.\nAlençon was brought down with a case of smallpox in October 1569. While it was uncomfortable for the prince, his condition was never critical. By mid November, Saint-Sulpice was able to report to Catherine that Alençon was now able to walk without a cane and was continually improving.\nOverseeing Alençon's education, he highlighted as a model for the prince his elder brother the duc d'Anjou. This inspired a bitter jealousy in Alençon of Anjou, who knew Catherine preferred her elder son.\nRepresenting Catherine's positions with the young prince, Saint-Sulpice exerted his efforts to dissuade Alençon from following the advice of those who wished for him to leave the court. He urged Alençon demonstrate obedience to Catherine. In 1570 he was denounced to Catherine due to the behaviours of Alençon but he protested to the queen against the 'slander'.\nSaint-Sulpice would largely stay with the young prince at court from 1569 to 1572. Alençon indulged in hunting, sports and persistent womanising. His reputation for the latter activity forced Saint-Sulpice to reassure Catherine in mid April that his ward had been conducting himself in a proper manner, and that since Lent the only women he had been in contact with were the duchesse de Nevers (duchess of Nevers), duchesse de Nemours and the duchesse de Montmorency. Alençon had neither seen nor spoken to any other women according to Saint-Sulpice.\nAt Alençon's request, Saint-Sulpice was made governor of the princes appanage in January 1570.\n\n\n=== Edict of Saint-Germain-en-Laye ===\nSaint-Sulpice was among the grand lords assembled to hear the articles of peace that had been negotiated by the king to bring the third war of religion to a close in August 1570. After the terms were read, Charles admitted he had failed to bring about victory by force of arms necessitating this course. The king's two brothers, Anjou and Alençon then swore to uphold the terms, they were followed by the other lords present, Saint-Sulpice included.\nIn January 1572 a company of thirty lances was created for Saint-Sulpice. He established his half-sister's husband René de Pins-Montbrun as the lieutenant of the company. The following year Montbrun would be made a chevalier of the ordre de Saint-Michel thanks to Saint-Sulpice's influence. Meanwhile, the guidon of the company was Saint-Sulpice's eldest son Henri.\nA marriage was to be established between the young Protestant king of Navarre and the king's sister Marguerite as a term of the 1570 peace. Keen to see this marriage brought to pass the queen of Navarre departed her court to finalise negotiations with Catherine in January 1572. In opposition to the marriage, cardinale Alexandrini (cardinal Alexandrini) moved to reach the French court first. Saint-Sulpice was assigned as the cardinale's escort, and kept him waiting for six days in Bayonne. Alexandrini would however abandon his train and race to court, and the queen of Navarre was forced to wait outside Blois until the cardinale had departed. Alexandrini was unable to stop the marriage however, and agreement between the queen of Navarre and Catherine was reached on 4 April.\n\n\n=== Fourth French War of Religion ===\n\nThe reduction of Protestant held La Rochelle in 1573 involved many great nobles, among them the king's two surviving brothers the duc d'Anjou (who led the siege) and the duc d'Alençon; the duc d'Aumale and young duc de Guise, the king of Navarre and the prince de Condé. Saint-Sulpice was responsible for the security of Alençon and opined with disapproval that the siege trenches were no places for the son of a king. In the hopes of easing the princes situation Saint-Sulpice made a request of his wife to send asparagus to the army as it was a favourite food of the prince, and he hoped it would make him better able to tolerate the rigours of war. Alençon, like many of the other young lords on the siege line, furthered the risks of being involved in the siege through acts of bravado and glory seeking. Saint-Sulpice wrote with considerable excitement to his wife during the progress of the siege as to his contact with the duc d'Anjou 'Monsieur [Anjou] does me much honour and speaks to me privately more than I could have hoped or thought for... be assured that I do not forget my friends during these moments'. For Anjou there was benefit in opening this line of contact due to Saint-Sulpice's role in Alençon's household. Through such 'friendly chats' he could gain intel on what Alençon was getting up to. Saint-Sulpice also expressed pride at the involvement of two of his sons in the siege. Nevertheless, conscious of the dangers of the siege, he advised against his eldest son, Henri joining the besieging army. He noted that his son the seigneur de Comiac had taken an arquebus shot to the leg, and that this was surely proof of the honour he was gaining. He assured his wife the shot had missed the bone and was not dangerous. However, Comiac's wound became infected, and he died. Saint-Sulpice held onto the fact that his sons brave death had created a glorious reputation which would continue beyond his life. He wrote to his wife on 22 April that they were both filled with regret that god had saw fit to take Comiac from them. Nevertheless, he was pleased with the grace god had granted them by giving Comiac such a positive reputation that he would be sorely missed for a long time.  Comiac was just one of many noble deaths during the siege, with 66 of the 155 most senior officers involved in the operation dying during its course.\nIn August 1573 Saint-Sulpice secured the lands of a bastard noble of Quercy who had disappeared.\nHis son Henri defected from the household of Saint-Sulpice's ward Alençon to join that of Anjou after his election as king of the Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narodów (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), joining the French prince in his new kingdom. Anjou would reign in the Commonwealth from January to June 1574. During his stay in the Commonwealth, Saint-Sulpice's son came to be under the protection of the comte de Retz. Retz thus wrote to Saint-Sulpice to assure him of his son's good health. Retz further flattered Saint-Sulpice through praise of his son. When Retz returned to France in March due to word arriving with Anjou of the plot of La Molle and Annibal de Coconas, Henri Ébrard returned with him. With Anjou's return to France a few months later, now styled as king Henri III, he adopted Henri Ébrard as one of his favourites.\n\n\n=== Fifth war of religion ===\nIn early 1574, Saint-Sulpice retired to his estates. Saint-Sulpice would not join the duc d'Alençon in his rebellion despite being his surintendant. He sent admonitions to the young prince for his plotting from his estates. The baron was briefed by the king in mid January that there existed in Poitou and Saintonge evildoers who were bringing both the Catholic and Protestant nobility into opposition to the crown in the name of the 'common good'. Thus briefed, Saint-Sulpice proved critical in preventing an alliance between the 'gentleman of La Rochelle, Poitou and Saintonge' with the rebellious Protestants of Languedoc who were entering a state of rebellion in January 1574.\nOn 2 April, Saint-Sulpice and Villeroy were tasked with rendezvousing with the governor of Languedoc the baron de Damville. They were to negotiate with him in the hopes of fragmenting the Protestant-malcontent coalition. The two men were provided with secret instructions of the concessions they would be permitted to make in any negotiations if necessary. If their negotiations were not successful, they were to invite Damville and a Protestant deputation to court. Having arrived at Avignon, the ambassadors were informed Damville would not see them. At this time they learned that the king had arrested Damville's brother the duc de Montmorency. Alongside receipt of this information they received new instructions from Catherine to see to Damville's arrest. They were to transmit this to the lieutenant-general of Languedoc, Joyeuse and Fourquevaux.  Neither envoy could understand such instructions, being unarmed in the province of which Damville was governor it would be significantly easier for Damville to arrest them. The two men passed three weeks in the province, issuing instructions relieving the people and leaders of the province from their loyalty to Damville, before returning to the royal court, where they learned Charles was dead. Damville entered rebellion and attempted to seize Narbonne.\n\n\n== Reign of Henri III ==\nAt the start of the king's reign, on 10 September 1574, a new regulation was issued as concerned court protocol. When the king entered his cabinet for the day the following men were to remain present in the chamber: princes, officers related to the affairs at hand, the four sécretaires d'État, the bishops of Orléans, Limoges and Valence, the future archbishop of Toulouse, Bellièvre, Pibrac, and Saint-Sulpice, alongside a couple of others.\n\n\n=== Alençon's rebellion ===\nIn September 1575 Saint-Sulpice was back at court with Alençon. He was caught off guard by Alençon's flight from court on 15 September to join with the rebels. Henri was furious and exploded in anger. Saint-Sulpice, who was sleeping in Alençon's chambers, broke down crying when he learned of what had transpired. Alençon established himself in Dreux and issued a manifesto.\nSaint-Sulpice bemoaned to Henri that with his charge Alençon's fall into rebellion he had lost not only his offices but his honour. He thus asked Henri to compensate him for his losses and thereby demonstrate the 'pride and esteem' in which he was held. As a result, his pension was increased by 1,000 livres and a 2,000 livres pension was established for his son. This addressed his material losses.\nIn the winter of 1575, Saint-Sulpice was sent as an extraordinary ambassador to the duc de Lorraine alongside the royal favourite Villequier.\nWith the triumph of Alençon in the fifth war of religion he was made duc d'Anjou, Touraine and Berry. His income expanded dramatically and with it his household. In August 1576 it contained 942 officers among whom there were 111 chambellans (chamberlains) and 157 gentilhommes de la chambre. Around this time in August 1576, Saint-Sulpice lost his position as surintendant de la maison and was replaced by the comte de Saint-Aignan. Soon after Saint-Sulpice's departure, he was followed by the relatives he had installed in the household.\nThe pfalzgraf von Zweibrücken (count palatine of Zweibrücken) demanded a great amount of money from the French crown to compensate him for his campaign into France during the Third War of Religion. The French crown was forced to resort to various financiers to raise the sum with the threat of another invasion if his terms were not granted. As a part of the agreement Saint-Sulpice was to hand over one of his children to Zweibrücken, however he was ill inclined for this to come to pass. He, and another of the hostages fathers proposed instead that their children stay with the duc de Lorraine so that they would not have to go into Protestant territory. Greatly aggrieved by these refusals, Zweibrücken had the French diplomats who were with him arrested in August and made them bare witness to his triumphant entry into Heidelberg, accompanied by all the money and jewels he had already received from France.\n\n\n=== Peace of Beaulieu ===\n\nHaving held a meeting with the king of Navarre, Saint-Sulpice returned to his estates in September 1576. In Quercy Catholic and Protestant gentleman, alongside the consuls of towns came to him. Saint-Sulpice made the king's desire for peace clear to them all. He was proposed by some of the gentleman as a delegate for the upcoming Estates General that was due to convene as a term of the peace. Saint-Sulpice declined the offer, arguing that it was not right for a conseiller d'État to be a delegate in the Estates.\nThough not in Henri's council during its first incarnation at Lyon in September 1574 when the ratification of the handover of the remaining French territories in Piemonte was undertaken. Saint-Sulpice would be a conseiller d'État by December 1576.\nHoping to see Saint-Sulpice's son confirmed in his position as bishop of Cahors, the gentleman of Quercy wrote to the Papal Nuncio describing Saint-Sulpice in effusive terms as one of the most illustrious baronial families in France'.\nHenri delivered the opening address before the Estates General on 5 December 1576. Saint-Sulpice was overflowing in praise for the 'eloquence and grace' of the address, which in his estimation left all who heard it stunned. Even Henri's firmest critics were supposedly impressed.\nSaint-Sulpice's son Henri, who was very close to the king Henri refused to return to the king's brothers' service. He arrived back at court alongside Saint-Sulpice to a warm greeting from the king on 3 December, the latter spoiling them both with fine foods. Alençon entreated the young Henri to return to his service though Saint-Sulpice's son declined. Saint-Sulpice meanwhile, sensing the toxic atmosphere between the royal brothers took the opportunity to draw up his will. Henri Ébrard got into a dispute with a member of Alençon's entourage (the vicomte de Tours) after insulting him during a game of pall mall. Subsequently, he was ambushed and assassinated by a group of men on 20 December 1576. Saint-Sulpice explained to the marquis de Villars that his son and Tours were reconciled by Aumale, yet only a few hours later Henri was stabbed to death. The assassin would escape royal punishment despite Saint-Sulpice's campaigning. Saint-Sulpice granted 20,000 livres to the widowed comtesse de Nègrepelisse and a further 10,000 livres in jewellery. These expenses put great strain on his finances. The king for his part, gifted Saint-Sulpice 15,000 livres to express his sympathy at the events.\nSoon after the assassination, Saint-Sulpice departed the court with the body of his son. Absent from the court he received a letter from the sécretaire d'État Villeroy offering his condolences and frustration at the violence of court, something Villeroy saw as a consequence of the civil wars. The seigneur de Lansac likewise expressed his sympathies to Saint-Sulpice, and informed him that the mastermind of the killing, the vicomte de Tours, had been executed in absentia. On 5 June an effigy was decapitated at Tours. Henri would intervene in 1579 to see the vicomte was punished while he was detained in the Papal territory of Avignon for an unrelated crime.\nSaint-Sulpice looked for payments from the court to assist his financial circumstances, however despite grants from Henri these grants remained unfulfilled.\n\n\n=== Peace of Bergerac ===\nIn April 1577, Henri sought to begin negotiations to bring about the end of the sixth war of religion. To this end he made a careful selection of southern French lords with diplomatic and political experience to negotiate a new peace. Among those selected for this responsibility were Saint-Sulpice who in addition to being a southern lord had experience as ambassador to España, the baron de Biron, the bishop of Valence, the sieur d'Escars from the Limousin, the seigneur de La Mothe-Fénelon former ambassador to England from the Périgord and the prince du sang duc de Montpensier. In part the involvement of La Mothe-Fénelon and Saint-Sulpice was a recognition of their respective roles as external ambassadors. This delegation arrived in Bergerac for negotiations on 25 April. Negotiations continued in the city until 24 June, when they were broken off by the Protestants who found the abrogation of the Edict of Beaulieu in favour of a new edict unacceptable. The sécretaire d'État Villeroy would then be dispatched in September with new instructions, and a treaty was negotiated successfully with the Protestant rebels to bring the war to a close. According to Jules Gassot, Villeroy outshone all the other men involved in the negotiation. The edict of pacification was thus signed at Bergerac on 14 September. Henri was delighted by the new peace, and opined to Saint-Sulpice that it would restore the kingdom to good health.\nHenri wrote to Saint-Sulpice in November praising him for his role in bringing about the coming of peace. Henri asked whether Saint-Sulpice would be willing to assist in the enforcement of the peace in Guyenne alongside his brother-in-law marshal de Biron.\nOn 11 May 1578, shortly after the killing at court of the comte de Caylus, another favourite of Henri's, Saint-Sulpice wrote of his regret on hearing the news to his mother the comtesse de Caylus. It had only been two years prior that Saint-Sulpice's son had been killed at court. Having been informed of it prior, it was only when Saint-Sulpice confirmed the news to her that she believed it. La Mothe-Fénelon wrote to Saint-Sulpice hoping he could provide clarification on what exactly had transpired.\n\n\n=== Treaty of Nérac ===\n\nSaint-Sulpice was alongside Catherine and the other members of Catherine's 'political entourage' at the Château d'Ollainville for the elaborate departure of Marguerite de Valois to join with her husband the king of Navarre on 2 August 1578. This 'political entourage' was composed of men of considerable skill, who in Knecht's estimation were some of the king's 'ablest advisors'. Alongside Saint-Sulpice in this group were the secrétaire d'État Pinart, Paul de Foix who would go on to be archbishop of Toulouse, the bishop of Valence and the seigneur de Pibrac. Beyond these political allies of Catherine were the Catholic Bourbon princes, whom Catherine hoped would intimidate their cousin the Protestant king of Navarre.\nCatherine and her team of political advisors then departed themselves from Ollainville on Henri's instruction to conduct a mission of pacification in the troubled southern provinces. Saint-Sulpice participated in the mission despite his bitter feelings. The party reached Bordeaux on 18 September where Catherine endeavoured to dissolve a Catholic brotherhood that had formed in the city. The missions attention then turned to convincing Navarre and the Protestants of the crowns peaceable intentions towards them. The group spent the next five months working to overcome the hesitancy of the Protestants to withdraw from the 200 or so places that they had failed to depart with the coming of peace.\nDuring negotiations Saint-Sulpice, Pibrac, Foix and the cardinal de Bourbon rejected the 36 article cahiers grievances submitted by the Protestant church of Languedoc on the grounds most of the demands were contrary to the previous peace edict. Catherine meanwhile succeeded in getting Navarre to back down from the maximalist Protestant position. On 28 February 1579 an accord was reached with the Protestants by which the reformers would receive nineteen places of surety for a period of six months. Freedom of religion would not be established across the kingdom as had initially been demanded by the Protestants.\nCommissioners were established for the enforcement of the treaty of Nérac. For Guyenne there would be Guichard de Scorbiac and the vicomte de Gourdon for the Protestants, and Saint-Sulpice and Jean de Vezins the sénéchal of Quercy for the Catholics.\nAs a reward for his participation in the pacification efforts, Henri included him in the second induction (1579) of his new most senior chivalric order of France. Thus Saint-Sulpice became a chevalier (knight) of the Ordre du Saint-Esprit (Order of the Saint-Esprit). In the same induction as Saint-Sulpice came several princes du sang, as well as various members of Catherine's circle: the seigneur de Lansac, marshal de Matignon, and Saint-Sulpice's cousin La Mothe-Fénelon.\n\n\n=== Illness and death ===\nIn 1580, during the seventh war of religion, the rebel Protestants seized and sacked Cahors. This blow so proximate to Saint-Sulpice's landed interests came as a great blow to the baron.\nIn March 1581 Saint-Sulpice was employed by Catherine as a negotiator again, alongside La Mothe-Fénelon, Bellièvre and her chancellor Roissy.\nIn early 1581 Saint-Sulpice retired from his role at court despite having been made a conseiller d'État for a second time. He justified his absence on the grounds of his health troubles. He wrote up a new will in which his son Bertrand was established as his sole heir on condition Bertrand provide a dowry to his sister. He died on 5 November 1581.\nSaint-Sulpice was survived by his wife, who was supported in the management of her financial affairs by Saint-Sulpice's friends. She was owed 55,000 livres by king Henri but he was unable to pay. As such Henri instead confirmed Bertrand as commander of his fathers hommes d'armes (men-at-arms) and the pension Saint-Sulpice had enjoyed of 4,000 livres.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBabelon, Jean-Pierre (2009).

        "content": "Neustadt\nThe Neustadt (officially known as Bremer Turn- und Sportgemeinde Neustadt von 1859 eV) is a sports club located in Bremen, in the Bremen-Neustadt district. The club was formed on January 1, 1972, as a result of the merger between Bremer TG and TuS Bremen-Neustadt. With twelve departments catering to various sports and music activities, Neustadt offers its members a wide range of options to pursue their interests.\n\n\n== Departments ==\nThe Neustadt encompasses twelve departments, including badminton, basketball, football, handball, karate, athletics, gymnastics, marching band, folklore, table tennis, gymnastics, and volleyball. The football and volleyball departments have been particularly successful in terms of the number of teams and the level of leagues.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Men's Football ===\nThe men's football team initially competed in the regional league but was subsequently relegated to the district league in 1973. After a brief stint in the association league from 1975 to 1978, they secured two consecutive promotions and gained entry into the Bremen upper house for the first time in 1980. However, the team experienced back-to-back relegations, which led them back to the district league. In 1987, they earned promotion once again and returned to the Bremen upper house, which had been renamed the Association League. In 1991, the team qualified for the newly established Oberliga Niedersachsen/Bremen after two years of battling relegation. This promotion came about due to the withdrawal of higher-placed clubs, OT Bremen and TSV Lesum.\nAlthough narrowly missing out on relegation, the team eventually returned to the top league after four years and made their mark. However, they were unable to maintain their position and were subsequently relegated again. The Neustadt men's team competed in the Bremen Association League until 2004. Since their relegation in 2008, they have been playing in the Bremen district league. In the 2011/12 season, the Neustadt achieved the district league championship, earning promotion to the Bremen regional league, which is at the sixth-tier level. Three years later, they were promoted to the Bremen League, marking their return to the top-tier Bremen league.\n\n\n=== Women's Football ===\nThe Neustadt women's football team experienced their first successes in the early 1980s. They clinched the Bremen championship title in 1983 and 1984 but were eliminated in the first round at the national level. During the same period, the team qualified for the DFB Cup on four occasions but faced early exits. In the 1983/84 season, they suffered a 1-16 defeat against KBC Duisburg. After a prolonged period of relative insignificance, the team made a comeback to the DFB Cup in 2006, only to face a 0-16 loss to VfL Wolfsburg in the first round. Notably, the club produced Christine Frai, a former FIFA referee.\n\n\n== See Also ==\nSports in Bremen\n\n\n== Literature ==\nHardy Greens: Northern Germany – Between TSV Achim, Hamburger SV, and TuS Zeven.

        "content": "New Balance 550 is a basketball shoe produced by New Balance.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe shoes were designed by Steven Smith and created as a low top version of the company's New Balance Pride 650. The shoe was originally known as the New Balance P550 Oxford and was primarily a budget shoe and sold for $45 when it first released in 1989. The shoe was designed to improve on the New Balance Pride 480. Smooth leather was used for the upper and used perforated profile panels and lightweight mesh for the base to make it more breathable, a major complaint with the 480. The heel had a molded structure to improve stability and lockdown and the sole used an updated traction pattern and layout to provide better responsiveness. The shoe also featured a very thick sole with EVA foam.\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nThe shoe was brought back in 2020 when Aimé Leon Dore decided to do a collaboration and relaunch it. The shoe was not a success when it first launched decades ago and was so obscure for the company itself that it had to buy used pairs and find old sketches in order to recreate the release as close to the original. The release proved to be so successful that it led to the shoe becoming a general release for the company.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James Bosgrave (1547?–1620s) was an English Jesuit\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBosgrave was born at Godmanston, Dorsetshire, 'of a very worshipful house and parentage,' about 1547. He was probably a brother of Thomas Bosgrave, who suffered along with Father John Cornelius at Dorchester on 4 July 1594. He left England in his childhood; entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus at Rome on 17 November 1564; and was ordained priest at Olmütz in Moravia in 1572. For twelve years he taught Greek, Hebrew, and mathematics at Olmütz, whence he was sent to Poland and eventually to Vilna in Lithuania. His health declining he was ordered by his superiors to return to England to try his native air. He was seized on landing at Dover in September 1580, was taken before the privy council, and was subsequently committed to the Marshalsea prison and cruelly tortured there. Afterwards he was removed to the Tower of London and was affain put to the torture. Some time after his arrest Bosgrave consented to attend the services of the established church, and was thereupon set at liberty. His fellow Catholics naturally held aloof from him as an apostate. He then addressed to the privy council a protest in which be declared that he had been deceived through his own ignorance and their fraud, and he likewise printed another protest for the Catholics. He was at once re-arrested. On 14 November 1581 be was arraigned in the king's bench, with Father Edmund Campion and others, and on the 20th of that month he received sentence of death, but at the request of Stephen Báthory, king of Poland, Queen Elizabeth consented to spare his life. He was reprieved and remanded back to the Tower. It was alleged by the government that he and Henry Orton, a lay gentleman, gave answers different from those made by the other priests to the questions put to them about the deposing power of the holy see. The government published these replies in 'A Particular Declaration or Testimony of the undutiful and traitorous afiection borne against her Majestie by Edmund Campian, Jesuite, and other condemned priests,' 1582. It has been supposed that the answers of Bosgrave and Orton are not correctly given (Foley, Records, iii. 292, 772), but there can be no doubt that Bosgrave wished to be neutral between two extreme parties.\nAt length Queen Elizabeth was prevailed upon to restore him to liberty, and on 21 January 1684-5 he was sent into exile with Father Jasper Haywood and others, twenty-one in all. He returned to Poland and died at Calizzi on 27 October 1621, or, as another account sets forth, in 1628, 'septuagenario major.'\nHe is the author of 'The Satisfaction of M. James Bosgrave, the godly confessor of Christ, concerning his going to the Church of the Protestants at his first coming into England.' It is printed with 'A True Report of the late Apprehension and Imprisonment of John Nicols, Minister at Roan,' Rheims, 1583.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cooper, Thompson (1886). \"Bosgrave, James\".

        "content": "Michael O'Connor (1801 – 25 June 1867) was an Irish stained-glass artist based successively in Dublin, Bristol and London.  A pupil of Thomas Willement, he developed a Gothic Revival style under the influence of Augustus Pugin, with whom he worked.  He acquired a high reputation, and was commissioned to create windows for several cathedrals in England, Wales and Ireland.  He is now seen as one of the leading stained-glass artists of his generation working in Britain.  His stained-glass firm survived his death, initially under the management of his sons, and lasted until 1915.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMichael O'Connor, born in Dublin, began his professional life as a heraldic artist, but along with many other early 19th-century practitioners of that art he decided to move into the renascent field of stained-glass design.  Going to London in 1823, he studied this art under Thomas Willement, one of the leaders of the revival of stained-glass manufacture in Britain, and then returned to Dublin to establish his own business.  In an 1839 trade directory he is listed as a \"professor of heraldry, stained glass enameller, and ornamental painter, print & bookseller, and fancy stationer\".  He exhibited stained-glass designs at this time at the Royal Hibernian Academy.  He moved his business to Bristol in 1842, and there began to work with Augustus Pugin, under whose influence he adopted a neo-medieval style later to be praised by Pevsner for its avoidance of \"Victorian dimness and fussiness of small detail\".  One of their notable collaborations was on the glass for St Saviour's Church, Leeds.  In 1845 he made his final move, to London, where he set up business premises at 4 Berners Street.  O'Connor's collaborators included not just Pugin but William Butterfield, William Warrington, and his own son, Arthur O'Connor, with whom he went into partnership by 1852.  By the 1850s he had acquired a high reputation, and was selected for inclusion in the Great Exhibition of 1851.  He nevertheless, as a Catholic, suffered from religious prejudice which hindered his efforts to get commissions from the Church of England authorities for prestigious projects, and resulted in 1862 in the firm's newly installed windows for the Anglican church in Enniskerry, St Patrick's, being smashed by Protestant demonstrators.  The firm  did, however, make windows during and after Michael O'Connor's lifetime for the Royal Chapel of All Saints, Christchurch Priory, Peterborough Cathedral, Salisbury Cathedral, Llandaff Cathedral (the glass was destroyed by enemy action in 1941), Tuam Cathedral, Chichester Cathedral, Clontarf Castle, and the chapels of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Balliol College, Oxford, and Eton College.  In 1856 O'Connor developed problems with his eyesight which increasingly necessitated his assigning work to his sons Arthur and William Henry.  The style of the firm's glass can be seen to have changed at about this time, losing much of Michael O'Connor's simplicity.  Forced to retire by failing health, O'Connor died on 25 June 1867.\n\n\n== Later history of the company ==\nO'Connor's sons William Henry and Arthur continued the firm successfully after his death, expanding their activities into the field of painting as well as continuing the design of stained-glass windows.  By 1873, the year Arthur died, the company had changed its name from O'Connor and Sons to O'Connor and Taylor.  The new partner, William George Taylor, was perhaps brought in more for his business expertise than for artistic talent.  In 1877 the name changed again to Taylor and O'Connor.  It adopted its final name, Taylor and Clifton, in 1902, and continued in business until 1915.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAllen, John (2024). \"Architects & Artists N-O\".

He was from the Rorgonid family, the son of Gauzfrid, Count of Maine and Margrave of Neustria.\nUpon his father's death in 878, he was too young to inherit his father's responsibilities, and it was a cousin, Ragenold, who became Margrave of Neustria and Count of Maine. \nWhen Ragenold was killed by Viking raiders in 885, Henry was appointed as Margrave of Neustria and Roger became Count of Maine.\nGauzlin allied himself with the Robertians, and when Odo became King of France, he deposed Roger in 893 and appointed Gauzlin as Count of Maine. However, Gauzlin could not hold on to Maine and Roger regained control of Maine in 895.\nGauzlin continued the fight against Roger, and then against his son Hugh I. They eventually made peace and it is probable that Hugh married a daughter of Gauzlin during the peace. He died in 914.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alessandro Poerio was an Italian scout cruiser, the lead ship of the Alessandro Poerio class. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1915, she served during World War I, participating in the Adriatic campaign, initially operating in the upper Adriatic Sea and later in the southern Adriatic. She took part in 66 operations during the war, often supporting raids by Italian motor torpedo boats. She was reclassified as a destroyer in 1921 due to her light displacement. Like her sister ships, Cesare Rossarol and Guglielmo Pepe, she was named after a famous Neapolitan light cavalryman who helped defend Venice from attacks by the Imperial Austrian Army during the revolutions in 1848.\nIn 1937, Fascist Italy sold the ship to the Nationalist faction in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Renamed Huesca, the ship subsequently served in the Spanish Navy until she was stricken in 1953.\n\n\n== Design ==\nAlessandro Poerio was an Italian \"light scout cruiser\" (Italian:esploratore leggero) measuring 85 m (278 ft 10 in) long and 8 m (26 ft 3 in) in beam. She had three Yarrow three-drum water-tube boilers with water pipes, two groups of Belluzzo steam turbines rated at 24,000 hp (17,897 kW), and two three-blade propellers. Her fuel capacity of 325 tons gave her a range of 2,400 nautical miles (4,400 km; 2,800 mi) at 13 knots (24 km/h; 15 mph). She could launch torpedoes while maintaining a constant speed of over 30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph). Her normal displacement was 891 tons standard, and her full-load displacement was 1,270 tons.\nPlans originally called for Alessandro Poerio to have an armament of four 102/35 mm guns and eight 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes, but was revised during construction, and she entered service with six 102/35-millimetre guns and four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes, and a minelaying capacity of 42 mines, making her armament equivalent to that of an Austro-Hungarian Novara-class scout cruiser. In 1917 two 40/39 mm guns were installed aboard her. In 1918, she was refitted with 102/45 mm guns.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nAlessandro Poerio was laid down by Gio. Ansaldo & C. at Sestri Ponente, Italy, on 25 June 1913. She was launched on 4 August 1914 and commissioned on 25 May 1915.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Regia Marina ===\n\n\n==== World War I ====\n\n\n===== 1915–1916 =====\nWorld War I began in 1914, and the Kingdom of Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. Alessandro Poerio entered service two days after Italy declared war. On 30 December 1915 she became part of the 2nd Scouting Group of the 4th Naval Division along with her sister ships Cesare Rossarol and Guglielmo Pepe, based at Venice.\nOn 1–2 November 1916, Alessandro Poerio, Guglielmo Pepe, and the destroyers Francesco Nullo, and Giuseppe Missori made ready to provide possible support to an incursion by MAS motor torpedo boats into the Fasana Channel on the southwest coast of Istria, a peninsula on the coast of Austria-Hungary.\nAn Austro-Hungarian Navy force consisting of the scout cruiser Helgoland and the destroyers Balaton, Csepel, Lika, Orjen, Tatra, and Triglav left Cattaro on 18 October 1917 to attack Italian convoys. The Austro-Hungarians found no convoys, so Helgoland and Lika moved to within sight of Brindisi to entice Italian ships into chasing them and lure the Italians into an ambush by the Austro-Hungarian submarines U-32 and U-40. At 06:30 on 19 October 1917,  Alessandro Poerio, Guglielmo Pepe, and the destroyers Insidioso, Pilade Bronzetti, and Simone Schiaffino got underway from Brindisi to pursue the Austro-Hungarians. The destroyers Ippolito Nievo and Rosolino Pilo and the British light cruiser HMS Weymouth diverted from a voyage from Vlorë (known to the Italians as Valona) on the coast of the Principality of Albania to Brindisi to join the pursuit. After a long chase which also saw some Italian air attacks on the Austro-Hungarian ships, the Austro-Hungarians escaped and all the Italian ships returned to port without damage.\nOn 10 March 1918, the destroyer Antonio Mosto, with the motor torpedo boat MAS 100 in tow, and Ippolito Nievo, towing MAS 99, set out for a raid on Portorož (known to the Italians as Portorose) on the coast of Austria-Hungary, supported by Alessandro Poerio, Cesare Rossarol, Pilade Bronzetti, the scout cruisers Augusto Riboty and Carlo Mirabello, the destroyer Giacinto Carini, and a French Navy destroyer squadron led by the destroyer Casque. Antonio Mosto, Ippolito Nievo, MAS 99, and MAS 100 reached the vicinity of Portorož, but then had to postpone the operation due to bad weather. The ships attempted the raid again on 16 March, but adverse weather again forced its postponement. They made a third attempt on 8 April 1918, but after aerial reconnaissance ascertained that the port of Portorož was empty, the Italians again called off the operation.\nOn 2 October 1918 Alessandro Poerio, Cesare Rossarol, Gulglielmo Pepe, Ippolito Nievo, and Simone Schiaffino were at sea with the battleship Dante Alighieri and the scout cruiser Carlo Alberto Racchia to provide distant cover for a British and Italian naval bombardment of Durrës. The main mission of Alessandro Poerio′s force was to counter any attack against the bombardment force by Austro-Hungarian ships based at Cattaro.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. World War I ended with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918.\n\n\n==== Post-World War I ====\nIn 1921, Alessandro Poerio was reclassified as a destroyer. She made various cruises and took part in representation missions in the Aegean Sea and Black Sea. In 1927, she underwent modifications that included the removal of one of her 40/39 mm guns. In 1933, her commanding officer was Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) Ignazio Castrogiovanni, who as a capitano di vascello (ship-of-the-line captain) during World War II would receive a posthumous Gold Medal of Military Valor as commanding officer of the destroyer Aviere in 1942.\nDuring 1936, Alessandro Poerio underwent minor repairs and maintenance. With the Spanish Civil War underway, Fascist Italy sold Alessandro Poerio (for a price of 5 million pesetas) and Guglielmo Pepe to the Nationalist faction in Spain. Handed over to the Spanish Nationalists at the end of October 1937, Alessandro Poerio finally was stricken from the Regia Marina′s naval register on 5 January 1939.\n\n\n=== Spanish Navy ===\n\n\n==== Modifications ====\nThe Spanish Nationalists renamed the ship Huesca. An old ship by 1937, she had worn-out propulsion machinery and, in the view of the Nationalists, inadequate armament. She underwent major modifications in which her hull was lengthened by 1 metre (3 ft 3 in), her draft was reduced to 2.8 metres (9 ft 2 in), her original boilers were replaced by five Yarrow boilers, one 102 mm (4 in) gun and both 40 mm guns were removed, and two 37 mm and two 20 mm guns were installed. Her standard displacement dropped to 845 tons aand her full-load displacement to 911 tons, her maximum speed fell to 31 knots (57 km/h; 36 mph), and her crew rose to 130 men.\n\n\n==== Service history ====\nThe Spanish Nationalists took possession of Huesca at Sardinia at the end of October 1937. Manned by a Spanish crew, she departed Sardinia under the command of Capitán de corbeta (Corvette Captain) Luis Carrero Blanco — a future admiral — on 29 November 1937 bound for Palma de Mallorca on Mallorca in the Balearic Islands. Upon arrival, she joined the Nationalist destroyer flotilla based there and began convoy escort duties, support to ground operations, the interdiction of merchant ships of the Second Spanish Republic, and antisubmarine patrols. She put to sea for the first time on 14 December 1937, but soon suffered a mechanical breakdown and had to return to base. Frequent mechanical difficulties would dog her throughout the Spanish Civil War, leaving her short of acceptable performance as a Nationalist ship.\nOn 5 April 1938, Capitán de corbeta (Corvette Captain) Félix de Ozámiz took command of Huesca. Under his command, she got underway from Palma de Mallorca as part of a flotilla on 24 May 1938, and that night her sister ship, the destroyer Teruel (the former Guglielmo Pepe) accidentally rammed her stern. Teruel proceeded to Cádiz for repairs to her bow. Meanwhile, the seriously damaged Huesca returned to Palma de Mallorca, which she reached with considerable difficulty. After emergency repairs, she departed Palma de Mallorca on 14 June 1938 and proceeded to Cádiz, where she was under repair until 20 August 1938.\nIn the last days of August 1938, Huesca participated along with a large part of the Nationalist fleet in an operation to intercept the Spanish Republican Navy destroyer José Luis Díez. The operation forced José Luis Díez to take refuge at Gibraltar.\nHuesca then returned to Palma de Mallorca in September 1938, continuing with blockade operations and capturing the motorsailer Arsenio off the coast of Castellón on the morning of 17 October 1938. On 9 February 1939 she participated in the Nationalist occupation of Menorca, transporting troops there. On 5 March 1939, she proceeded with several other Nationalist ships toward the Province of Murcia, Spain, in anticipation of an anti-communist revolt that was taking place at the Cartagena Naval Base in Cartagena. The revolt was put down without Huesca taking any action.\nAfter the Spanish Civil War ended in victory for the Nationalists in 1939, Huesca was incorporated into the post-civil war Spanish Navy. She had proven mechanically unreliable during the conflict, and the Spanish Navy made no attempt to upgrade her capabilities after the civil war. Relegated to use as an auxiliary and training ship, she was stricken from the naval register on 17 August 1953. She subsequently was scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFernández Díaz, Victoria (2009). El exilio de los marinos republicanos (in Spanish).

        "content": "SG Union Sandersdorf is a football club based in Sandersdorf-Brehna, a town in the Anhalt-Bitterfeld district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The club, which has around 1,000 members, plays its home matches at the Sandersdorf Sports and Leisure Center. The team's colors are green, white, and black.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded in 1911 as BC Union Sandersdorf. In 1933, SV Sandersdorf merged with Union Sandersdorf. After World War II, the club played under various names such as SG Sandersdorf and BSG Werk Hermann Fahlke Sandersdorf. In the 1948/49 season, the football department achieved its first successes as BSG Aktivist Sandersdorf when they became one of the co-founders of the new Saxony-Anhalt South state class, which was the top division in Saxony-Anhalt at the time.\nFollowing the dissolution of the states and state leagues in East Germany, the club played in the Halle district league from 1952. In 1957, the club was forcibly merged with BSG Chemie Wolfen and appeared as BSG Chemie Wolfen II until 1959. From 1959 onwards, they played as BSG Chemie Sandersdorf and competed primarily in the district league. In 1990, following the political changes in Germany, the club transformed into the registered association SG Chemie Sandersdorf, which later changed its name to SG Union Sandersdorf in 1991.\nIn 1992, the football team was promoted to the district league and eventually reached the state league. In 1997, Union Sandersdorf achieved promotion to the Verbandsliga, the highest league in Saxony-Anhalt at the time. After two seasons, the club was relegated back to the regional league in 1999. They secured promotion back to the Verbandsliga and achieved their best result to date with a second-place finish in the 2010/11 season. Two years later, despite finishing second again, they were promoted to the NOFV-Oberliga Süd, the fifth-highest division in Germany, as the national champion Haldensleber SC waived their right to promotion.\n\n\n== Stadium ==\nThe club plays its home matches at the Sandersdorf Sports and Leisure Center, which was opened in 1954 as the \"Glückauf-kampfbahn Hermann Fahlke.\" The stadium features a covered grandstand with 280 seats and 500 standing places, a scoreboard, and a modern floodlight system. In addition to the stadium, the club has an artificial turf pitch and access to a multi-purpose sports hall and a ball sports hall.\n\n\n== Football Section ==\nThe football section of SG Union Sandersdorf has achieved notable success, including promotions to the Verbandsliga and the NOFV-Oberliga Süd. The club also has a joint youth support association, JFV Sandersdorf/Thalheim, with SG Rot-Weiß Thalheim. The youth teams participate in various leagues organized by the Saxony-Anhalt Football Association.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

Describing the first couple of batches as tasting like \"crayons\", Chris Joseph spoke with his gelatin supplier and eventually improved the recipe, creating Wyld's first two flavors, marionberry and raspberry in the process. In 2016, the company moved to its current headquarters in Portland, Oregon.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWtriting for Forbes.com, Lauren Yoshiko called the gummies \"Juicy and soft\" and lacking the cannabis oil taste usually associated with edibles. She also enjoyed the flavor, saying that if she wasn't \"treating them like medicine\" she would eat the \"whole pack of ten in one sitting\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Agnes Mary Tropper (née Barnett, 1917–2009) was a British mathematician, textbook author, and translator.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAgnes Mary Barnett was born in Sheffield in 1917, and grew up in London. She was educated at Christ's Hospital, a boarding school in Hertford, supported by a scholarship from the county of London. She read mathematics at Bedford College, London, a school for the higher education of women in the University of London that later became part of Royal Holloway, University of London, and earned first-class honours in 1939. She also earned an education diploma from the London Institute of Education, another school of the University of London that later merged into University College London as the UCL Institute of Education.\nIn the early 1940s she studied part-time for a master's degree at Birkbeck College, while working as a teacher. She completed a Ph.D. in 1953, through the University of London. Her doctoral dissertation, Infinite Matrices: A Study of Sequence Transformations and Reciprocals, was supervised by Richard G. Cooke.\n\n\n== Teaching career and later life ==\nBarnett taught at the Godolphin School in Salisbury from 1940 to 1942, and then in Harrow. In 1946, she became a lecturer at Queen Mary College. Soon after, she married another academic at the college, Austrian electrical engineer Hans Tropper, changed her name to his, and began raising a family (two daughters) with him. One daughter, Anne Tropper (born 1954), later became a notable physicist.\nDespite being told that \"to continue her career, her main priority must be the College\", she continued at Queen Mary, focusing primarily in teaching, administration, and textbook authorship rather than mathematics research.\nShe died on 6 February 2009.\n\n\n== Books ==\nTropper was the author of:\n\nLinear Algebra / An Introduction to Linear Algebra (London: Nelson, 1969, 1981; New York: Elsevier, 1969)\nMatrix Theory for Electrical Engineers / Matrix Theory for Electrical Engineering Students (London: Harrap, 1962, 1966; Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 1962; German translation, Mannheim: Bibliographisches Institut, 1964, 1975; French translation, Paris: Masson, 1965; Spanish translation, Madrid: Paraninfo, 1967)\nHer translations from German into English include:\n\nIntegral Equations (Guido Hoheisel; London: Nelson, 1967)\nIntroduction to Modern Mathematics (Herbert Meschkowski; London: Harrap, 1968)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "John Nicholls (1555–1584?) was a Welsh  religious controversialist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNicholls was the son of John Nicholls. He was born at Cowbridge, Glamorganshire. After having attended various ‘common schools,’ he entered, at sixteen, White Hall (now Jesus College), Oxford. A year later he removed to Brasenose, but left the university without a degree. He returned to Wales, and, after acting as tutor in a family for a year and a half, became curate of Withycombe, Somerset, under one Jones, vicar of Taunton. He afterwards officiated at Whitestaunton, Somerset, but in 1577 he left the church, and travelled by London to Antwerp. A week later he visited Dr. William Allen, at that time head of the English seminary at Douay. Nicholls seems to have still professed himself a Protestant, and was banished the town. He then proceeded to Grenoble, where he stayed with the archbishop three months. Subsequently, he served the Bishop of Vicenza, and visited Milan, and was admitted to the English seminary at Rome. He appears to have voluntarily presented himself before the inquisition, 27 April 1578, and was commanded to preach in defence of the Roman church before the pope and four cardinals on 25 May 1578. He entered the seminary on 28 May, having publicly abjured Protestantism and received absolution, which was published by the notary 8 May 1579. He preached a Latin sermon on St. Peter's day, 5 August 1579.\nNicholls remained at the seminary two years, but professed to despise the scholars who, he says, could ‘neither construe Latin nor preach as well as the shoemakers and tailors in England.’ Having obtained from the pope a viaticum of fifty crowns, under pretence of ill-health he left Rome some time in 1580 for Rheims, where Allen was then living. Nicholls, however, proceeded to England, and not long after was arrested at Islington, and committed to the Tower of London by Sir Francis Walsingham and the Bishop of London. During his imprisonment he wrote: ‘John Niccols Pilgrimage, wherein is displayed the lives of the proude Popes, ambitious Cardinals,’ &c., London, 1581; also ‘A Declaration of the Recantation of John Nichols (for the space almost of two yeeres the Pope's Scholar in the English Seminarie or Colledge at Rome), which desireth to be reconciled and received as a member into the true church of Christ in England,’ London, 1581. The recantation was made 5 February, before Sir Owen Hopton, lieutenant of the Tower, citizens, and prisoners, and was printed on 14 February. This book is rare. Two copies were placed in the British Museum—one in the Grenville Library there, and another with valuable manuscript notes. Soon after ‘A Confutation of John Nicolls his Recantation’ came out anonymously, and was answered by Dudley Fenner in ‘An Answere unto the Confutation,’ &c., London, 1583. Nicholls also published ‘The Oration and Sermon made at Rome, &c., by John Nichols, latelie the Pope's Scholar,’ with an address to the queen, and an autobiographical letter to the worshipful Company of Merchant Adventurers at Embden and Antwerp, London, 1581. The same year appeared, anonymously, ‘A Discoverie of J. Niccols, Minister, misreported a Jesuite, latelye recanted in the Tower of London, wherein … is contayned a ful Answere to his Recantation, with a Confutation of his Slaunders.’ The author of this book was Robert Parsons. No copy is in the British Museum, but one was placed in the Bodleian. It was answered by Thomas Lupton in ‘The Christian against the Jesuite, Wherein the secrete or namelesse writer of a pernitious booke intituled A Discouerie, &c. … is … justly reprooued,’ London, 1582.\nAfter his recantation Nicholls was employed to preach to the Catholics in the Tower. Upon Easter Sunday, 19 March 1581, he preached there before a large company of nobles and courtiers invited by Sir Owen Hopton (Records of the Society of Jesus, ii. 164). It was intended to give him ‘the next living that fell in’ (Strype, Grindal, pp. 390–1). In the meantime Archbishop Grindal was prayed by the council, 10 May 1581, to direct the bishops to contribute to the maintenance of their convert; 50l. a year was collected for him. But at the end of 1582 Nicholls again crossed to the Low Countries and Germany, in company with Lawrence Caddey, his former fellow-student at Rome, who had also recanted in England. He was thrown into prison at Rouen, and again turned to Romanism. In letters to Dr. Allen, dated 18 and 19 February 1583, he expressed penitence, and professed that his statements written in the Tower, and accusations brought against Sir George Peckham, Judge Southcot, and others, were extracted from him by Sir Owen Hopton under threats of the rack. On 20 February 1583, Nicholls was examined, and retracted his accusations against the English colleges at Rome and Rheims, to which Dr. Allen had already replied in his ‘Apologie and True Declaration … of the two English Colleges.’ ‘A True Report of the late Apprehension and Imprisonment of John Nicols,’ containing also the ‘Satisfaction’ of three other recusants—Caddey, Richard Baines, and James Bosgrave—was published at Rheims in 1583 by the Catholics. Nicholls's letters to Dr. Allen, and a public confession, are printed at the end of Nicholas Sanders's ‘De Schismate Anglicano,’ lib. iii., Ingolstadt, 1588, pp. 334, 351. Nicholls probably died in 1583 or 1584, Watt (Bibl. Brit.) says ‘in great misery.’ Weak, inconstant, ‘timorous,’ and boastful, Nicholls appears to have wholly lacked convictions. Rishton, in the continuation of Sanders's ‘De Schismate,’ is probably wrong in crediting him with the intention of becoming a mahometan. He says he was ‘never at heart a Romanist,’ and was probably more inclined to Calvinism than to any other form of religious belief.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, Charlotte Fell (1894). \"Nicholls, John (1555-1584?)\".

        "content": "The Sixth is an 2024 American documentary film, directed and produced by Andrea Nix Fine and Sean Fine. It follows the January 6 United States Capitol attack through the perspective of individuals who lived it. \nIt was released on May 3, 2024, by A24.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nIt follows the January 6 United States Capitol attack through the perspective of individuals who lived it. Robert Contee, Mel D. Cole, Daniel Hodges, Erica Loewe, Jamie Raskin and Christina Laury appear in the film.\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn January 2021, it was announced Andrea Nix Fine and Sean Fine would direct a documentary revolving around the transition of power between presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden for A24. Initially, The Fines sent a crew to capture Trump's speech, unaware of what was about to happen, before losing contact with their cinematographer Caz Rubacky and seeing the events of January 6 United States Capitol attack happen. Following the attack, The Fines decided to change course and make the film about the attack, with A24 agreeing.\nThe Fines did not purchase any footage shot by insurrectionists, instead using other sources.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released on video on demand on May 3, 2024. Initially the film was set to be released on Amazon Prime Video alongside video-on-demand, but this plan was rolled back. The distribution of the film was criticized by multiple outlets, including participants, Jamie Raskin and Mel D. Cole, with Cole strictly participating in the film due to the involvement of A24. The films release was compared to other A24 documentaries receiving releases with little fanfare including My Mercury and Open Wide.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nNoah Gittel of The Washington City Paper wrote: \"This is the power of the documentary form. Never again must we forget our own nightmares. Especially when they come true.\" André Hereford gave the Metro Weekly gave the film four out of five stars writing: \"The Sixth delivers an urgent eyewitness chronicle of the Capitol under siege from people who feared for their lives that day.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Sixth at IMDb",

        "content": "John of Châtillon (died 6 July 1298) was a canon of the Order of Val des Écoliers and a regent master of theology at the University of Paris.\nJohn was a canon at the convent of Sainte-Catherine by 1288, when he attended the inventorying of the convent's library. He incepted as a Master of Theology at Paris under either Gregory of Burgundy or Laurence of Poulangy. He succeeded the latter in his order's chair at Paris when Laurence became prior of Verbiesles in 1297. That year, he served as executor for Thierry de Saint-Véran, archdeacon of Évreux. He died the next year and was succeeded by John of Bray. The general chapter of Val des Écoliers held in 1299 ordered the celebration of his anniversary.\nJohn has been identified with the anonymous master of Val des Écoliers (Magister de Valle Scholarium) who took part in a quodlibet from which two questions are preserved in the collection of Nicholas of Bar. Palémon Glorieux dates the quodlibet to 1294–1295. Both the identification and the dating are uncertain. The quodlibet may belong to Laurence of Poulangy.\nJohn of Châtillon of Val des Écoliers is a different person from the Dominican of the same name (fl. 1267–1281) who was provincial master of France and from the Franciscan of the same name known from two sermons dated 1272–1273.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

        "content": "Aron von Reis, originally Aron van Rees (born 30 August 1777 in the Netherlands, died 9 June 1848 in Marstrand, Sweden, was a Dutch-Swedish industrialist in Gothenburg. He and a business partner specialized in creating cotton textiles and printing floral patterns on them called kattun, receiving royal decorations for their success.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nAron von Reis was the son of tobacco processor and factory owner Andreas van Reis (alternatively called Anschel, Andries van Rees, Andreas wan Reijs, Anders von Reis) and Sara Aronsdotter Herfurt, he from Nijkerk, she from Amsterdam, both deceased in Gothenburg. She was a descendant of Philip Uri Joosten Halevi. The family was among the first Jews allowed to settle in the Marstrand Free Port, so declared by King Gustav III of Sweden.\n\n\n=== Career ===\nIn 1815 von Reis and Aron Magnusson founded the successful cotton printing plant known as Aronsdal in Gothenburg. Magnusson's and von Reis's wives Fredrika Marcus and Lowisa Marcus were first cousins. Their factory annually produced over 100,000 ells of plain cotton cloth and printed such. King Charles XIV John of Sweden and Norway awarded each of the partners a gold medal with the ribbon of Vasaorden in 1821 for their industrial achievements. The following year, the partners also opened a weaving facility Wäfveriet Lovisa Fredrica in Aronsdal (today the Krokslätt area of central Gothenburg), and the von Reis family resided in the factory's apartments 1816–1823.\n\n\n=== Family ===\n\nAron von Reis and his brother Moses von Reis both married daughters of Norrköping community leader Jacob Marcus. Aron and his wife Lowisa had 17 children whose notable descendants include Isa Quensel, Magnus Uggla, Stefan Anderson and  Birgit Ridderstedt. Two of their sons were among the first students at Chalmers University of Technology and the Gothenburg Institute of Commerce. Another son had a very early photo studio in Gothenburg. Hugo Valentin has described the von Reis family in his writings. Aron's brother Moses is among the ancestors of Siri von Reis and her daughter Serena Altschul.\nThe marked graves of Aron von Reis and his wife and parents are all in the Old Mosaic Cemetery of Svingeln in Gothenburg.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Printed source ===\nJudarna på svensk mark, Historien om israeliternas invandring till Sverige by Eskil Olan, Stockholm 1924",

        "content": "Mykolas Kalmantas (born Mykolas Kalmantavičius; 18 October 1895 – 6 June 1976) was a Lithuanian military officer. Apart from being one of the founders of the Aeroclub of Lithuania, Kalmantas had a significant role in commanding a contingent of Lithuanian soldiers during the Klaipėda Revolt of 1923. His son, Vytautas Mykolas Kalmantas, was a famous fencer and athlete.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nMykolas Kalmantas was born on 18 October 1895 in the village of Mėčionys, then belonging to the Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire, to Matas Kalmantavičius and Anelė Kalmantavičienė née Kuodytė. In 1912 Kalmantas graduated from the St. Petersburg Secondary Technical School. In 1915 Kalmantas attended the St. Petersburg gymnasium, later studying at the Moscow Institute of Archeology. Kalmantas's studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War as he was conscripted into the Russian Imperial Army. In 1916 he graduated from the Petergof 3rd Praporshchik War School, after which he received the rank of praporshchik, an NCO rank equivalent to sergeant major. Kalmantas served in the 124th and 293rd Reserve Regiments of the Russian Army. In 1917 he was sent to work at a commandant's office in the city of Torzhok, located in the Tver Governorate. For one year Kalmantas served as the commander of the commandant's company at the 128th division. In 1917 he joined the Lithuanian Reserve Battalion, one of the first 20th-century Lithuanian military units. After the unit was disbanded, Kalmantas returned to Lithuania and for some time worked for the Vilija company's workshop office in Vilnius.\n\n\n=== Independence Wars ===\nOn 3 July 1919 Kalmantas was mobilized into the Lithuanian Army and assigned to the Ukmergė Infantry Battalion's second company as a junior officer. Later he was appointed the commander of the company's machine-gun squad. In November he was promoted to senior lieutenant. After the battalion was transformed into the 8th Infantry Regiment on 10 December, Kalmantas became the regiment's chief of the regimental communications team\njust five days later on 15 December. From 1919 to 1920 Kalmantas along with the battalion fought against various Bolshevik forces in the region of Zarasai, and against Polish forces near Augustów and Vilnius. On 20 August 1920 he was made the sixth company's, and later the training company's chief. As was the customary reward for people serving in the army during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, Kalmantas received land ain the village of Beržai near Jonava. \nIn May 1922 Kalmantas was promoted to captain. On 13 October 1922 Kalmantas graduated from the Higher Officers' Courses.\n\n\n=== Klaipėda Revolt ===\nThe Lithuanian government and military intelligence sent Lithuanian activists to Lithuania Minor to propagate unification with Lithuania. The Supreme Committee for the Salvation of Lithuania Minor (SCSLM), chaired by Martynas Jankus, was established to unite all such \"local\" activist committees. After signing up as a volunteer for the march to Klaipėda, the SCSLM was notified about Kalmantas being made the commander of the second group of rebels under the codename of Mikas Bajoras. From 9 to 22 January 1923, Kalmantas commanded his contingent in taking over the Pagėgiai city and district; Jonas Budrys, one of the most important military intelligence figures in the revolt, reported Kalmantavičius's activity as follows:\"<...> Mikas Kalmatavičius (Bajoras) was appointed the commander of the second group with the task of occupying the Pagėgiai county and establishing himself in the Tilžė district, which he fulfilled at the appointed time.\" On 15 January, Kalmantas's contingent broke through the French lines at Klaipėda, occupying the city. Kalmantas personally arrested the senior French governor of the region Gabriel Petisné – it is said that after Petisné demanded Kalmantas show his papers, Kalmantas instead drew his revolver and arrested Petisné. Jonas Budrys described that: \"Later, with two other companies, he was summoned near the city of Klaipėda and after Captain Strielnik captured the Althof manor, he [Kalmantas] received the task of occupying the bar and taking the city. They pushed the entrenched enemy with a powerful blow and forced them to retreat. The operation was complicated by the fact that the left wing – the second company – stopped as its company commander was killed near the Rumpischen estate and began to retreat in confusion. Nevertheless, at the risk of death every minute, setting an example to his subjects, he went forward and captured a part of the city as far as the river Danga, capturing about 60 well-armed Frenchmen with officers and 10 machine guns.\" \nKalmantas's contingent also had the task of protecting the border with Germany. Kalmantas was later made the area's commandant. On 16 January Kalmantas was made the commander of the 1st regiment of the volunteer rebels of the Klaipėda region. From 1923 to 1925 Kalmantas was commander of an unknown battalion belonging to the 8th Infantry Regiment. In July 1923, Kalmantas was awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis, 1st degree, for \"bravery and cleverness during the operation of the liberation of Klaipėda\".\n\n\n=== Military officer career in Lithuania ===\nAs was common for military officials, Kalmantas studied at the Vytautas Magnus University Faculity of Law. In 1924 Kalmantas flew to Denmark to participate in an international scout meeting. In 1927 Kalmantas led a scout delegation that went to Sweden for an international scout festival. From 1925 to 1927 he was a chief scout. In February 1926 Kalmantas was promoted to mayor. In 1927 Kalmantas, along with others, established the Aeroclub of Lithuania. In 1929 Kalmantas was promoted to lieutenant colonel. From 1925 to 1935 Kalmantas was the Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union, a paramilitary organization. A reform in 1935 made it so the Union was directly subordinate to the Chief of Defence of Lithuania, integrating it closer with the Lithuanian defensive structure. Such reforms caused disagreements between Kalmantas and the military leadership, and so Kalmantas officially resigned in the same year.\nAfter his resignation, Kalmantas was elected a member of the council of elders of the Kaunas Garrison Officers' Club, as well as the President Antanas Smetona's secretary. In 1935 Kalmantas was chairman of the Lithuanian-Finnish Rapprochement Society. On 20 July 1935 he was transferred to the army headquarters and appointed as a special affairs officer under the army commander general Stasys Raštikis. In November 1935 Kalmantas was promoted to colonel. On 3 November 1938 he transferred to the armaments board as chief of the General Department.\n\n\n=== Soviet occupation and World War II ===\nWhen the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania, Kalmantas was discharged to the infantry officers reserve on 25 June 1940. On 17 December, NKVD officer Aleksandras Gudaitis-Guzevičius gave the order to follow Kalmantas. On 14 May 1941 Kalmantas was arrested and interrogated. The interrogators especially questioned Kalmantas on his work with the Lithuanian-Finnish Rapprochement Society. However, the interrogation did not finish due to the Operation Barbarossa. Furthermore, the June Uprising which occurred on 23 June 1941, freed Kalmantas from prison, after which he joined rebels in Kaunas. On the same day, Kalmantas was appointed as the deputy head of the armaments board of the Kaunas war command, which was just formed by order of the Provisional Government of Lithuania. On 23–24 July, pro-Nazi Lithuanians (remnants of the Iron Wolf organization), following the wishes of Nazi Germany, unsuccessfully tried to overthrow it. \nKalmantas at this point was made deputy military commandant of Kaunas. After some time Kalmantas was allowed to resign. For some time he served in the Lithuanian Auxiliary Police's communications headquarters. From 1943 to 1944 Kalmantas was head of Kaunas city and county pension department. After the Germans began to retreat from the Soviet Union, Kalmantas decided to flee Lithuania. In summer of 1944 he moved to Germany, however on 29 August he returned and was appointed the head of the press and education department of the headquarters of the Fatherland Defense Force. After the Battle of Seda, having lost contact with his family, Kalmantas moved to the Allied-occupied zones in Western Germany.\n\n\n=== Emigration and later years ===\nIn 1948 Kalmantas emigrated to the United States and settled in Chicago, a city with a significant population of Lithuanian émigrés. He was a member of the group that revived the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union in 1954. Although the KGB searched for Kalmantas and his wife even after the war, after receiving information that Kalmantas was already in Chicago, the search was canceled in 1964. Although Soviet authorities claimed that they were in possession of his medals and a parade sword on which his Klaipėda Revolt codename Bajoras was inscribed, all of the items were lost. In his old age, Kalmantas lived in a nursing home, where he was provided with the help of Lithuanian doctors.\nKalmantas died on 28 November 1976. He was buried in the Lithuanian National Cemetery in Chicago.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nKalmantas received the following awards:\n\nOrder of the Cross of Vytis, 1st degree (1923)\nSilver Medal of the Liberation of Klaipėda (1925)\nFinnish National Guard Iron Cross (1926)\nLithuanian Independence Medal (1928)\nOrder of the Grand Duke Gerdiminas, 3rd degree (1928)\nLatvian War of Independence 10 Year Anniversary Commemorative Medal (1929)\nAizsargi Cross of Merit (1929)\nRiflemen's Star (1931)\nOrder of the Lily (1931)\nOrder of the Wolf of Gediminas (1932)\nFirefighters' \"To Help a Close One\" Order (1934)\nEstonian Firefighters' Cross, 1st gold order (1935)\nRiflemen's Star (1939)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===",

        "content": "Radium (1903 – 4 August 1922) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. A slow maturing racehorse, his most significant wins did not occur until his four and five-year-old seasons. After retiring from racing Radium became a successful stallion, siring 2000 Guineas winner Clarissimus and the sire of Phar Lap.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRadium was foaled in 1903 at Southcourt in Leighton Buzzard, the stud of his breeder and owner Leopold de Rothschild. He was sired by Derby and Champion Stakes winner Bend Or. After retiring from racing Bend Or became a successful stallion. His most successful son was the unbeaten Triple Crown winner, Ormonde. He also sired the champion sire Kendal and Eclipse Stakes winner Orbit. Bend Or was also the leading broodmare sire in Great Britain and Ireland for two years. Radium was foaled in the last crop of Bend Or, the aged stallion dying in January 1903 before Radium's birth.\nHis dam, Taia, was also bred by Rothschild and was a half-sister to the horse Eros (winner of Althorp Stakes). Raced for two seasons and winless in 10 starts, she had a difficult personality that prevented her from being a successful racehorse. Radium was Taia's fourth and last foal before her death in 1905.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== Early racing career ===\nRadium began his training as a two-year-old under John Watson in February 1905, with initial training runs being impressive. He started in the Khedive Plate at the Newmarket July meeting and was thoroughly beaten with his run later being described as \"indifferent.\" After a place in a race at the Goodwood meeting, Radium won the Price of Wales's Nursery Stakes at Doncaster. Returning as a three-year-old, he was third to Beppo and Bridge of Canny in the Union Jack Stakes in Liverpool and was unplaced for the Newmarket Biennial. He was second to Sarcelle for the Chippenham Plate at the second spring meeting at Newmarket. Radium's only Classic race start was in the 1906 Derby, which was won by Spearmint, where he battled with Troutbeck for a fourth-place finish.\n\n\n=== 1907: four-year-old-season ===\n\nRadium's form remarkably improved as a four-year-old with the press noting that he seemed to \"show what was in him.\" He won the Biennial Stakes, was second for the Great Yorkshire Handicap, and was unplaced in the Doncaster Cup. Following uncontested wins in the Rous Stakes and Rutland Handicap, Radium defeated the 11-4 favorite The White Knight in the Ascot Gold Cup. The running of the Jockey Club Cup in 1907 was described as, \"one of the most farcical races that has ever been run on Newmarket Heath.\" Radium beat The White Knight at the slow time of 5 minutes and 32 seconds, setting what the crowds remarked was a ridiculously slow pace for the length of the course.\n\n\n=== 1908: five-year-old season ===\nRadium lost the 1908 Ascot Gold Cup and Coronation Cup to The White Knight by a margin of five lengths in a much publicized rematch against the racing rivals. Winning the Dullingham Plate, Radium again raced The White Knight and beat him for the Goodwood Cup. Further wins in the Doncaster Cup, Beaufort Stakes, and a second victory in the Jockey Club Cup cemented Radium as one of the best older horses of the season.\n\n\n== Stud career ==\nRothschild retained Radium as a breeding stallion at Southcourt Stud for the remainder of the stallion's life. By 1920, Radium's fee had been reduced to £49 due to fertility issues, and he sired no foals after 1920. Radium was euthanised at Southcourt Stud on 4 August 1922 at the age of 19.\n\n\n=== Notable Progeny ===\nc = colt, f = filly\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\nRadium is inbred 3x5 to Stockwell.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Leticia Padua, known online as SheraSeven or Shera Seven, is an American livestreamer, YouTuber, dating coach, and social media personality. Her YouTube livestreams give dating advice to single women about marrying rich and getting money from men. She is also known as the \"sprinkle sprinkle lady\" for her catchphrase, \"sprinkle sprinkle\". Clips from her livestreams began going viral on TikTok in 2023. Critics have complimented her content for its humor while also describing her as controversial, variously calling her views on heterosexual dating \"deeply nihilistic\", \"Machiavellian\", and \"completely unprogressive\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nPadua began making YouTube videos as SheraSeven in 2013. Clips of SheraSeven's livestreams began being posted on TikTok in the spring of 2023. She had over 500 thousand YouTube subscribers by November of that year. Clips of her on TikTok amassed over 20 billion views by August 2023, and videos tagged with her catchphrase, \"sprinkle sprinkle\", had over two billion views on the platform by 2024. A fan account of hers, Sheralations, had almost 400 thousand followers on TikTok before being leaving the platform in 2023. Kerame Marcellus of Essence called Shera Seven \"a favorite on TikTok\" for her \"candid dating and money advice for women online\". In January 2024, SheraSeven was featured in Brandon Blackwood's Valentine's Day campaign.\n\n\n== Public image ==\nSheraSeven often encourages women over the age of 25 to employ manipulation tactics and reverse psychology to get rich older men to pay for their expenses while avoiding broke men, to whom she refers as \"dusties\", as a way to game the patriarchy. She is known online as the \"sprinkle sprinkle lady\" for her catchphrase, \"sprinkle sprinkle\", which she says after giving words of advice. Her fans have often jokingly described her as a female version of Andrew Tate. Critics have described her as controversial for her views on gender.\nSteffi Cao of Bustle identified SheraSeven as one of a crop of \"dark feminine\" influencers, whose content \"pull[s] viewers in with ... confidence and humor\", and summarized their philosophy as being that \"men are interchangeable, problematic, and take up too much emotional space\". For Vox, Rebecca Jennings called SheraSeven \"among the funniest people on the internet\" and \"extremely entertaining\", but added that she was \"part of a wave of arguably regressive and deeply nihilistic 'dating experts' currently taking over TikTok\" and that \"her philosophy ultimately reduces women to sexual objects whose value decreases the less traditionally attractive they become\". Tara Kenny of Dazed wrote in 2023 that SheraSeven and other women dating advice influencers took \"a hardline, Machiavellian stance that sets them apart from their softer, touchy-feely counterparts\" and that parts of their content \"fall into the same toxic thought patterns as those manosphere channels they're trying to counteract\". For Indy100, Kate Plummer called her opinions on gender roles in heterosexual relationships \"completely unprogressive\", while Raquel Rosario Sánchez wrote for The Critic that she \"dispense[d] faux-empowerment\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSheraSeven's husband, James Scott, works as an SQL developer and appears in the background of many of her livestreams.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In Haiti, scientific researchers make considerable efforts despite the obstacles. They often work in difficult conditions with limited resources. Their work is aimed at solving local problems in public health, sustainable agriculture, environmental protection and many others. Despite the challenges, their determination to contribute to their country's progress is remarkable.\nThere are several organizations, academic institutions and research laboratories in the country focusing on scientific research, such as (CREGED , LAQUE , CRAPU , CHIBAS , CERED , EDSE) , CRISH , ISTEAH  and Quisqueya University .\n\n\n=== The challenges of scientific publishing in Haiti ===\nIn Haiti, communication remains a major challenge for the popularization of scientific research. Scientific research is mainly published in French. Only 42% of the Haitian population can express themselves in French, and the majority speak Creole , the country's official language. This hinders the dissemination of knowledge in the country, despite research focusing on local issues.\n\n\n==== Outlook ====\nFaced with this chaotic situation facing researchers, universities and other entities have set up methods to raise funds to encourage scientific research. These include the Bank of the Republic of Haiti.\nScores on certain indicators, such as bibliometrics, have risen in various fields, including the environment, health and agronomy, thanks to research carried out at Quisqueya University .\n\n\n===== The role of researchers =====\nResearchers play a crucial role in society, conducting research and developing innovative solutions to problems in a variety of fields, from medicine to engineering to the environment. They help to advance science and improve people's lives through programs such as the study of organic matter in sediments to model environmental changes over the last millennium using a sediment core from Lake Azuei in Haiti .",

        "content": "Aquilegia × hybrida is a hybrid species of columbine, the result of a cross between Aquilegia vulgaris and Aquilegia canadensis.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAquilegia × hybrida often has bicoloured flowers with blue or purple sepals and white petals, but can also be all-blue or all-white or many other colours. It grows to between 30cm and 90cm, and is a hardy perennial flowering in May and June.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nAquilegia × hybrida was first identified by the botanist John Sims in 1809 from examples sent from Brompton, now part of London. Sims was uncertain whether the plant was a hybrid or a species in its own right, noting that its similarity to Siberian examples of Aquilegia vulgaris at Kew Gardens might mean the latter, but also noting the variation between bicoloured and single-coloured form suggested hybridity.\n\n\n== Cultivation ==\nVarieties of Aquilegia × hybrida are very popular garden plants and widely grown commercially. Notable cultivars include:\n\nBiedermeier Group hybrids: 30–45cm, white, purple, yellow, pink and blue flowers\n'Blue Star': 60cm, pendulous blue flowers\n'Crimson Star': 60cm, bicoloured flowers with red sepals and creamy spurred petals\n'Dragonfly' 60cm, long-spurred blooms in shades of white, pink, purple, yellow and blue\n'Hensol Harebell' 60–75cm tall with pendulous blue flowers\n'McKana': 60–75cm tall, long-spurred flowers in shades or red, yellow and blue, sometimes bicolour\n'Mrs. Scott Elliot': 75–90cm, often bicolored, red and yellow or blue and white\n'Music': 45–60cm, wide variety of flower colours\n'Silver Queen' 75cm, pendulous pure white flowers\n'Snow Queen' 75cm, pendulous pure white flowers\n'Songbird' 60cm, large bicolor flowers in shades of pink, white, blue and red\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Aquilegia × hybrida at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "The idea of an ATM blow up is to destroy the automated teller machine, in order to get the money that is inside it. This has also been done with other vending machines, such as those selling tickets, cigarettes or other goods. In some cases, the machines are destroyed to get the goods that are inside the machine.\nBlowing up a machine is a crime.\n\n\n== Mode of operation ==\nVery often, a flammable substance is led to the machine. Common substances are air with propane gas or acetylene.  A device is then used to detonate the mixure remotely. These devices are often self-built, improvised explosive devices. In other cases, true explosives or pyrotechnics are used.\nBoth professional criminals, and amateurs blow up devices. They operate alone, or in small groups or gangs. Usually, they operate at night, when there are few customers. Most detonations occur in the early morning hours.\nWhen the blow up the machine, the perpetrators are not always successful, and often they don't get to the money inside the machine. The federal criminal office (Bundeskriminalamt) reports that in 2017, that only in 48% of the cases, the perpetrators were able to get some money. In most cases, the damage done is more than the moey of the prey. In some cases, the damage is more than a million euros. There can also be a lot of damage to the surrounding area. The exlosions cause damage to buildings, in some cases, uninvolved people are hurt.\nWhen a group of people blew up a ticket vending machine in  Wittighausen, Baden-Württemberg, on 17th Septemer 2013, one of the peretrators was killed.   On December 10, 2016, there was a lot of damage to the bank, and the doctor's office opposite the bank, in Hagen. Another detonation of a ticket vending machine, in  Dortmund, on March 21, 2017, killed the peretrator. In Ottersberg , Lower Saxony, an apprtment block had to be evacuated after a detontion of an ATm in April 2017, for fear that the building would collapse. A detonation in  Espelkamp, on March 15, 2018, put the whole branch office of the bank on fire. On March 31, 2018, a mixed-use appratment block was heavily damaged, when there was an attempt at blowing up an ATM.\nIn 2020, about 40% of the detonations were done using explosives.\n\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n\nThere are countermeasures: These include cartouches with specially colored ink, which will mark the bank notes, if an attempted blow up is detected. There are also systems to monitor, and neutralize gas that is pumped into the ATM, and finally, the chamber containing the money has a strong protection, which will survive a detonation. Other measures include closing ATMs that are accessible from outside. Because more potent explosives are used more often, there are setups that use up to 15 cm of reinforced concrete on free-standing ATMs. These constructions weight up to 10 tonnes, and conventional explosives show no effect on them.\n\n\n== External links ==\nJudith Brosel und Ahmet Şenyurt von Report Mainz: Geldautomatensprengungen: Täter und Hintergründe –  Video, 10 min vom 10.

        "content": "Sturton railway station was an intermediate stop on the eastern main line of the Great Central Railway, opened in 1849. Besides the village of Sturton le Steeple in Nottinghamshire, England, it also served the villages of North Leverton with Habblesthorpe, North Wheatley, and South Wheatley, all also being in Nottinghamshire. It closed in 1959.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR) was formed on 1 January 1847 by the amalgamation of several railway companies, one of which was the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway (S&LJR). This had been incorporated on 3 August 1846 for a line linking Sheffield (on the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway) with Gainsborough (on the Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway).\nThe main line of the MS&LR between Manchester and Grimsby was opened in stages. The final section – that of the erstwhile S&LJR between Woodhouse Junction and Gainsborough – was opened by the MS&LR on 17 July 1849, and included five intermediate stations, one of which was Sturton, just over 70+1⁄2 miles (113.5 km) from Manchester.\nIn 1897, the MS&LR was renamed the Great Central Railway (GCR). In 1904 Sturton station had facilities for handling passengers, parcels, goods and livestock (including horses and prize cattle). The GCR amalgamated with other railways on 1 January 1923 to create the London and North Eastern Railway.\nSturton station closed to passengers on 2 February 1959.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMitchell, Vic; Smith, Keith (2018).

        "content": "Caramelo (lit. 'Caramel') is a horse known for having spent at least four days on a roof in Canoas during the floods in Rio Grande do Sul in May 2024.\n\n\n== Rescue ==\n\nThe horse was stranded in a house in the Mathias Velho neighborhood, Canoas, during the floods that occurred in Rio Grande do Sul in May 2024. He spent about four days stranded. According to veterinarians consulted by CNN Brasil, he survived because he was probably very well hydrated and fed.\nOn 8 May, Caramelo began to be monitored and some teams unsuccessfully attempted the rescue. The mayor of Canoas, Jairo Jorge (PSD), told GloboNews that the rescue would require a helicopter. The rescue planning was done during the night with the São Paulo State Fire Department and the team of veterinarians who helped rescue other stranded animals during the flood, including two horses that were trapped on a building staircase.\nOn 9 May, the rescue was carried out by the Fire Department accompanied by a team of veterinarians. The team was mobilized by General Hertz Pires do Nascimento, commander of the Brazilian Army operations in Rio Grande do Sul. Five boats and a helicopter were made available for the rescue. Around 11 a.m., Caramelo was anesthetized, laid down, and placed in a boat, where saline solution was used to keep him hydrated. He reached dry land around noon, when the boat was removed with Caramelo inside and placed on a trailer, where he was dried and taken to the veterinary hospital of the Lutheran University of Brazil (Ulbra). Caramelo was described as docile by veterinarians and weighed between 450 and 500 kg (990 and 1,100 lb) when rescued. Two dogs that were stranded on a nearby roof were also rescued.\nAt the hospital, it was checked whether Caramelo was injured and he received intravenous sugar solution to replace the liquid he lost while stranded. The horse was initially fed with a pasty food, with veterinarians planning to transition to grass as he recovered. On 10 May, he had a stable clinical condition, but was still dehydrated.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nCaramelo became nationally famous when he was filmed by TV Globo helicopter on 8 May. His rescue was widely reported in Brazil. Some newspapers, such as Metrópoles and Correio Braziliense, claimed that Caramelo was a symbol of resilience during the flood. Veja magazine stated that Caramelo's rescue showed the government's negligence regarding the flood warnings. The president of the Supreme Federal Court, Roberto Barroso, described the scene as emblematic. The horse stirred up emotions on social media. It was internet users who nicknamed him Caramelo (lit. 'Caramel'). On 8 May, the hashtag #SaveTheCanoasHorse trended on X (formerly Twitter). In addition to rescue requests, he was portrayed in memes, and journalist Renato Peters created a cartoon of him. Celebrities like Felipe Neto pressured for his rescue. The rescue also gained international attention.\nThe rescue was followed by Eduardo Paganella, a reporter for RBS TV. The rescue was also broadcast live on Mais Você, and it moved Ana Maria Braga deeply. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said he slept restlessly the night before the rescue and that Caramelo deserved \"a good rest\". First Lady Rosângela Lula da Silva also became emotional and said she was in contact with a stud farm where the horse would be transported. In response, comedian Whindersson Nunes posted a photo of actress Jade Picon in the soap opera Travessia washing clothes by hand in a river. Rosângela countered the post by writing that \"he doesn't know that washing machines have been invented for a long time\", but the comedian responded that \"this tweet doesn't allude to household chores, it alludes to doing a lot of hassle for something, about getting your hands dirty and making a big fuss about something\".\nShortly after his admission, some people showed up at the veterinary hospital claiming to be the owners of the animal. Giovanna Ewbank and Felipe Neto offered to adopt Caramelo.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCaramel mongrel\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Colin Dean Murdock (born October 8, 1981)  is a Canadian politician. He has served as the mayor of Saanich, British Columbia since 2022.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nMurdock was born at the Vancouver General Hospital to parents Randy and Linda Murdock (née Carswell), though he credits his birthplace as Richmond, British Columbia. His father was a safety inspector for a Molson brewery. The family moved to Saanich in 1993.  Murdock grew up in the Cordova Bay neighbourhood,  and attended Royal Oak Middle School and Claremont Secondary School. He attended Camosun College, and then the University of Victoria, where he took social sciences. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 2003 and a Masters in 2007. After university, he lived in Japan where he taught English.\nPrior to his election as mayor, Murdock worked as a political science instructor at Camosun College for three years, and worked for the BC Ministry of Health and the BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. He worked in the Ministry of Health for 17 years. Murdock served as chair of the Sierra Club Victoria from 2007 to 2008.\n\n\n== Early electoral experience ==\nMurdock first ran for office in 1999 at the age of 18, when he ran for school board representing School District 63 Saanich Peninsula. He earned 1,477 votes in the Saanich zone, missing a spot on the board by 59 votes.\nWhile a student at the University of Victoria, Murdock ran for a council by-election in Saanich in 2001 caused by the resignation of Sheila Orr, who was elected to the BC Legislative Assembly. He ran for council again in the 2002 municipal elections, winning 4,667 votes, finishing 11th on the 8 seat body.\n\n\n== District Council ==\nMurdock ran again for council in the 2008 British Columbia municipal elections on platform of \"making an efficient transportation network, a healthy ecosystem and protection for green space and agricultural land\". In the election, Murdock was finally elected to council, winning 9,079 votes, in sixth position.\nMurdock endorsed Mike Farnworth's campaign in the 2011 British Columbia New Democratic Party leadership election.\nMurdock was re-elected to council in the 2011 municipal elections, winning 11,899 votes, in fifth spot. He ran again in the 2014 municipal elections, running on a platform of creating a \"variety of new housing options\", addressing transportation needs, and \"standing up for farmland\" in the district.  In the election, Murdock topped the poll, winning 14,781 votes. While on council, he served as a director on the Capital Regional District from 2017 to 2018. His main focus as a councillor was on housing affordability, food security issues, emission reductions, and safety for pedestrians and cyclists.\nMurdock did not run for re-election in the 2018 municipal elections, citing family reasons.  After his term on council, he created a group called \"Better Mobility Saanich\" in an effort to identify dangerous walking and cycling routes to schools in order to improve active transportation infrastructure.  He also hosted a podcast called Amazing Places.\n\n\n== Mayoralty ==\nMurdock announced his intentions to run for mayor of Saanich in October 2021, a full year before the 2022 mayoral election. At his campaign launch, he announced \"It's time for new leadership at city hall\". He was endorsed by former councillors Carol Pickup and David Cubberley.\nMurdock was elected mayor of Saanich in the 2022 election, defeating incumbent mayor Fred Haynes by just 152 votes. Murdock ran on a platform of tackling housing affordability, creating accessible and walkable neighbourhoods and protecting against climate change.\nAs mayor, one of the main issues Murdock has had to deal with is balancing the province's mandate of building more housing and residents' opposition and concerns about new projects in the municipality. Murdock supports the provincial government's hosing targets. Another issue in Saanich that Murdock has had to deal with as mayor include calls from the police department for an increase in their budget due to \"lack of bodies responding to calls\" causing a reduction is safety for officers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "One for Junior is a 1991 studio album by Mark Murphy.\nOne for Junior is the 30th studio album by American jazz vocalist Mark Murphy. The album is a collaboration with Sheila Jordan. It was recorded in 1991 when Murphy was 59 years old and released by the Muse label in the United States in 1993. The album is a tribute to Junior Morrow. Murphy contributes the composition \"One for Junior\", co-written with Sheila Jordan.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSheila Jordan and Mark Murphy were longtime friends. After a concert they gave together in Cleveland in 1991 they decided to record an album together for Muse. Murphy and Jordan met at her home in New York to decide on the material they would include. In the title for the album, \"Junior\" is a reference to painter Helen Mayer, a longtime friend of Jordan and Murphy. Mayer called herself Junior Morrow. The album cover is a photograph of one of her original paintings. Mayer died before the album was recorded.\nIn the liner notes both Jordan and Murphy recount stories and memories of Helen Mayer. Both write about encounters at The Page Three nightclub in Greenwich Village owned by Jacquie Howe. Mayer frequented the night club, painted a mural there and Murphy and Jordan often performed at the club. Jordan first heard Murphy sing at Page Three. The three became friends there.\nThe song \"Difficult to Say Goodbye\" was written for Murphy by singer and songwriter Ellen Hoffman. She writes, \"I had written the song for him upon the death of his life-time partner, Eddie. A few years later he recorded it on a duo-album with Sheila Jordan...part of a 2-song medley. Sheila is singing \"Don't Like GoodByes\", (written by composer Harold Arlen) and Mark is singing my song\".\n\n\n== Recording ==\nMurphy and Jordan recorded the material for this release in September of 1991 at Sear Sound in New York City. Pianist Kenny Barron, bassist Harvie Swartz, and drummer Ben Riley who had recorded with Jordan on Lost and Found (Muse, 1990) were enlisted for the backup trio. Pianist Bill Mays who had recorded, arranged and produced multiple Murphy albums including Bop for Kerouac, Beauty and the Beast, and Kerouac, Then and Now, joined the group for the two George Gruntz tracks. The Gruntz compositions were from operas he composed; \"Aria 18\" is from Money: A Jazz Opera,  and \"Eastern Ballad\" is from Cosmopolitan Greetings. Gruntz, Murphy and Jordan were supposed to work together on Money but Murphy was not available at the time of production. Murphy did perform, tour and record the opera Cosmopolitan Greetings.\n\nThere were some problems during the recording. Sheila Jordan thought she sounded shrill on \"One for Junior\". Murphy had problems during the recording of the medley (track 9). He wanted the tempo to be very slow for his part, singing Hoffman's \"Difficult to Say Goodbye\", and insisted they slow down. Murphy was having trouble \"reading the music because of the way it was spread out across his music stand – again he regretted forgetting his glasses. He had to weave his head to see it better, and the microphone picked up the changes in his position\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nScott Yanow assigns 4.5 stars to this release on AllMusic. He said, \"This CD is a real gem...On a typically intelligent and chance taking program there are many highlights including a humorous conversation between hipsters on \"Where or When,\" a couple of ballad medleys and Jordan's witty lyrics on \"The Bird\"\". Yanow includes the release in his list of some of the best individual Muse sets in his book The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide.\nColin Larkin assigns 4 stars to the album in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music. (4 stars means, \"Excellent. A high standard album from this artist and therefore highly recommended\").\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Where You At?\" (George Handy, Jack Segal) – 6:27\n\"Round About / It All Goes Round\" (Vernon Duke, Ogden Nash / David Foster) – 6:26\n\"One for Junior\" (Sheila Jordan, Mark Murphy) – 7:58\n\"Trust in Me\" (Milton Ager, Jean Schwartz, Ned Wever) – 6:34\n\"The Bird: Tribute (Quasimodo) / Embraceable You\" (Charlie Parker, S.

They began producing automobiles and kits. The brand name was initially KF, then a little later AK, which stood for the initials of their first names. Ken's wife Lynda and their sons Dan and Jon supported the two men. Jon Freeman took over as director in 2009 when Ken and Lynda Freeman retired and is supported by his wife Wendi. So far around 300 vehicles have been built. In 2021, Southern GT was taken over and this company's model, a replica of the Ford GT40 , will be offered as the AK 40.\n\n\n== Vehicles ==\n\nThe Premier model appeared under the KF brand. This was the replica of the AC Cobra.\nA little later it became the 427 under the AK brand. A steel ladder frame forms the basis. An open fiberglass body is mounted on top. Various V8 engines power the vehicles.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nG.N. Georgano (Editor-in-Chief): The Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile. Volume 1: A-F.

        "content": "Ralph Erskine Hudson (July 9, 1843 – June 14, 1901) was an American composer and hymnwriter. He is best remembered for his addition of a refrain and composition of a new tune for the Isaac Watts hymn \"Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed\".\n\n\n== Early life and military service ==\nRalph Erskine Hudson was born on July 9, 1843, in Napoleon, Ohio. In his childhood, his family moved to Philadelphia. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Hudson enlisted in the Union Army, joining Company K of the 10th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment on June 20, 1861. Between June 1862 and February 1863, Hudson served as a nurse at the General Hospital in Annapolis, Maryland. While working at the hospital, he met Mary Smith, from Annapolis; the couple married on March 4, 1863. Hudson was honorably discharged on June 11, 1864.\n\n\n== Music career ==\nAn accomplished musician, after his discharge Hudson began teaching music at a college in Alliance, Ohio, where he remained for five years. While in Alliance, Hudson started a music publishing business. At the same time, he was a lay preacher in the Methodist Episcopal Church. He had a particular concern for evangelism, both in preaching and as an evangelistic singer.\nHudson's first hymn book, Salvation Echoes, was published in 1882. He later published a further four songbooks: Gems of Gospel Songs (1884), Songs of Peace, Love and Joy (1885), The Temperance Songster (1886) and Songs of the Ransomed (1887). Hudson was a prohibitionist, who advocated for total abstinence from alcohol; The Temperance Songster comprised songs addressing this topic.\n\n\n== Notable works ==\nSome of Hudson's hymns and choruses continue to appear in modern hymnals. Generally, his work has been better-known in America and Canada than in the United Kingdom.\nHudson's best-known original hymn is \"My Life, My Love, I Give to Thee,\" which was published in his collected Salvation Echoes (1882). This hymn was included in hundreds of 19th- and 20th-century hymnals, and is still included in the Baptist Hymnal, the primary hymnbook of the Southern Baptist Convention. It is generally sung to the tube \"Dunbar\", written by C.R. Dunbar.\nHudson also added refrains to some traditional hymns, including \"Alas! and Did My Saviour Bleed\" and \"O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing.\" His adaptation of \"O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing\" includes the repeated line \"Blessed be the name of the Lord.\" It was first published in Songs for the Ransomed (1887). It had particular popularity in Southern Baptist Convention churches, and is included in the Baptist Hymnal.\nHe composed music for the Clara Tear Williams hymns \"Satisfied\", which was first published in 1881. Describing the composition of this hymn, Williams wrote:\n\nAbout 1875, I was helping in meetings in Troy, Ohio, where Professor R. E. Hudson conducted the singing, when, just before retiring one night, he asked me to write a song for a book he was preparing to publish. Before sleeping, I wrote \"Satisfied.\" In the morning, he composed the music.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHudson died on June 14, 1901, in Cleveland, Ohio. He is buried in Alliance City Cemetery. His wife Mary died in 1925, and is buried with him in Alliance City Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aeon Sportscars Limited is a British manufacturer of automobiles.\n\n\n== Company history ==\n\nThe company was founded on November 3, 2000, in Marden, Kent. Keith Wood and John Timothy Hewat became directors on July 1, 2001. They began producing automobiles and kits in 2003. The brand name is Aeon. Since March 31, 2007, Susan Heather Wood has been the second director. Hewat left the company at the same time and founded Blaze Motorsport. Doncaster based Exceed Autocraft, led by Matthew Flett, was the licensee from 2011 to 2021. A total of around 17 copies have been created so far.\n\n\n== Vehicles ==\n\nThe first model was the GT 3 Coupé in 2003. Special features of the coupé are the three-seater design, with the driver sitting in the middle, and the gullwing doors. The engine usually comes from Ford. The GT 2 Coupé , which has been available since 2011, conventionally has two seats next to each other. The coupés have found around twelve buyers so far.\nThe GT 3 Spyder appeared in 2004. This is the open version of the coupe. The vehicles are usually powered by a four-cylinder engine from Volkswagen with a displacement of 1,800 cm3 and a turbocharger. Initially also three-seater, since 2011 there has also been the GT 2 Spyder and GT 2 Aero with two seats next to each other. So far, around five copies of the Spyder have been built.\nThe Epona was designed by Garry Gooderham. Aeon Sportscars presented a model at a trade fair in 2009, but did not put it into series production. Exceed Autocraft has been trying since 2011. This lightweight, front-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car is planned as a coupe and roadster.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nSteve Hole: A-Z of Kit Cars.

In the 2024 Portuguese national election she was elected to the Assembly of the Republic as a representative of the right-wing CHEGA party. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nVital was born in Luanda on 13 June 1965 in what was then Portuguese Angola. Her parents returned to Portugal from Angola when she was four, to live in the capital of Lisbon, residing in the Campo de Ourique district. She studied at Liceu Rainha D. Leonor, a girls’ school, and then graduated in 1991 with a degree in chemical engineering from the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (ISEL), now part of the Polytechnical Institute of Lisbon. In 1998 she received a master's degree in project management from the Lisbon campus of the Catholic University of Portugal. She also studied cardiopulmonology and rehabilitation.\n\n\n== Career ==\nVital initially worked as a quality supervisor and manager for Unilever, then becoming a category manager for Sonae, the largest private sector employer in Portugal. After her training in cardiopulmonology she started to work in this field in a clinic in Lisbon before moving to the Beatriz Ângelo hospital in Loures, to the immediate north of Lisbon, in 2012. She later took up a management position in the same hospital. \n\n\n== Political career ==\nVital joined CHEGA in August 2020. She was elected as a substitute member of the Lisbon City Council in the 2021 election. In the March 2024 national election she was sixth on the list of CHEGA candidates for the Lisbon District, with the party winning nine seats. In the parliament she was appointed to be a member of the Health Committee and the Labour, Social Security and Inclusion Committee. One of her first interventions in the National Assembly was to accuse her fellow parliamentarians of having no idea about the quality of public hospitals in Portugal because they were always treated privately.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Petar Bilušić (pronounced [pětar bǐluʃitɕ]; 25 June 1904 – 1994) was a Croatian poet and storyteller.\n\n\n== Life ==\nPetar Bilušić was born in Zaton (Šibenik) to father Dunko Bilušić Milošević and mother Jela née Bilušić. He finished 6 grades of elementary school in Zaton (1911 – 1917) and then worked as a laborer. He joined the workers' movement and was imprisoned in Lepoglava, Sremska Mitrovica, Niš and Šibenik. During 1941 he joined the war on the side of the partisans, but due to illness he was sent back to act from the background. He spent about 18 months in Italian camps (1942 – 1943). After trying to escape, he was taken to a concentration camp in Trieste and to a hospital in Piacenza. Upon his return to the homeland, he rejoined the war; he was the leader of a group of mobilized fishermen on the island of Žirje. After the liberation, he worked in Šibenik. Petar Bilušić died in 1994.\n\n\n== Literary work ==\nHis first publicized work was the poem Ogledalo in the illegal newspaper Krug (Sremska Mitrovica Prison, 1934). He wrote poems, fairy tales and children's stories with lyrical and humorous, sometimes sentimental and didactic features, publishing them in the following publications: Ilustirani vjesnik (1952), Omladinski borac (1952), Zapisi s njiva (anthology, 1952), Jutro (1954), Koraci (1954), Novine mladih (1954, 1955), Osvit (1954), Slobodni dan (1954), Šibenska revija (1954), Narodni kalendar Sloga (1955), Polimlje (1955), Radost (1955), Mladi zadrugar (1958), Vesela sveska (1958), Književne novine (1967), and in some daily and weekly newspapers. His drama Kuća na rubu šume was staged in theaters in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo, and his play Crvene šoljice was staged in the Croatian National Theatre in Šibenik. Some of his children's poems have been translated into Italian.\n\n\n== Works ==\nDjedo mornar i unuk kapetan (Zagreb, 1951)\nGrad na moru (Šibenik, 1954)\nPlave bajke (Šibenik, 1955)\nPut u Afriku (Šibenik, 1956)\nBjegunci (Šibenik, 1959)\nGavanovi dvori (Šibenik, 1959)\nGospodin magarac (Šibenik, 1960)\nKuća na rubu šume (Šibenik, 1960)\nPakleni tjesnac (Šibenik, 1960)\nLjudi iz slijepe ulice (Šibenik, 1966)\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "content": "Walk Again Project is an international, non-profit consortium led by Miguel Nicolelis, created in 2009 in a partnership between Duke University and the IINN/ELS, where researchers come together to find neuro-rehabilitation treatments for spinal cord injuries, which pioneered the development and use of the brain–machine interface, including its non-invasive version, with an EEG.\n\n\n== History ==\nNicolelis, a Brazilian neuroscientist working at Duke University, who had been proposing the use of BMI in his laboratory since 2006, but had been exploring this area since 1999. He had demonstrated the viability of BMI alongside scientist John Chapin, in 2008, together with Gordon Cheng, in an experiment where they tested the first continental BMI, where an ape in North Carolina controlled a robot in Kyoto.  This was a precursor of the Walk Again Project. Previously, in 2000, Nicolelis had already demonstrated, in a publication in Nature, the possibility of a computer decoding an ape's brain signals in order to move a robotic arm. The project, which began in 2009, is a partnership between institutions in the US, Switzerland, Germany, and Brazil.\nIn one of its first steps, published in 2011, the project team made a monkey control a mechanical arm and receive tactile information from this tool, including in the virtual world, with the team's research being welcomed \"as an important advance by the scientific community\", according to Veja magazine. That year, in his book “Beyond boundaries”, Nicolelis described his plan to make a patient take the opening kick of the FIFA World Cup, in a project budgeted at R$33 million at the time (U$S 15,305,489.56 in 2013), and funded by Finep.\n\nIn 2012, in the process of creating the BRA-Santos Dumont exoskeleton for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the project team recorded 1847 neurons simultaneously, something, until then, unprecedented. The next research project saw mice being able to sense tactile information from infrared light, as a possible new form of BMI communication. The following year, the project received authorization to test the exoskeleton in Brazil, with volunteers from the Association for Assistance to Disabled Children testing the equipment since the beginning of November 2013.\nWhen he returned to Brazil for the project, Nicolelis found that the patients did not want to undergo surgery as a way of regaining movement. This led his team to develop non-invasive techniques that were able to help patients chronically, something, according to the scientist, “that had never been done in decades of research and treatment of spinal cord injuries.”\nIn 2013, the project team revealed that they had been able to make two rhesus monkeys control two virtual arms, using only their thoughts. The research was published in Science Translational Medicine. In March 2014 the two exoskeletons were already in Brazil.\nThe initial contact with FIFA was made in 2012, but the plan to give the inaugural kick, which would even involve the patient getting up from his wheelchair and crossing 25 meters of the pitch, was abandoned by the entity. Nicolelis has been aware of the time limitation since March. 2014. In the end the demonstration, carried out by the patient Juliano Alves Pinto during the 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony, was reduced to just three seconds on the world network, which was the subject of controversy.\n\nThe Walk Again team, made up of 150–156 people for the World Cup, had no control over image production, but the rest of the project was carried out successfully. The “MIT Technology Review” listed the exoskeleton as one of the “main failures” in technology in 2014, something Nicolelis refuted, while “The Verge” identified him as “one of the 50 world personalities of 2014”.\nOn March 3, 2016, the team demonstrated the use of BMI on apes so that they could move wheelchairs using only their thoughts. On August 11 of the same year, a new study was published in Scientific Reports. Eight paraplegic patients, who had lost all movement in their lower limbs due to spinal cord injuries, experienced a partial neurological recovery after 12 months of training with virtual reality, a robot, and an exoskeleton.\nThe experiment described above involved 6 men and 2 women: in four cases, the patients became “partially paralyzed”; a 32-year-old woman who had been paralyzed for more than a decade became able to walk with support after 13 months. One of the two women was able to become pregnant after restoring sensation inside and outside the body, as well as some men regaining sexual ability. The patients reported that the treatment had improved their quality of life.\nThe researchers were surprised by the improvements, since the damage to the spinal cord would have prevented the brain from communicating with the rest of the body. Nicolelis then theorized, still without evidence via imaging tests, that the immersion and mental focus on the training would have stimulated brain plasticity, possibly causing the brain to transmit information through what remained of the nerves.\n\nIn 2018, in an article published in PLOS One, the project demonstrated seven complete paraplegic patients becoming partial paraplegics due to the 28-month-long training with the BMI. In 2019, in a study published in Scientific Reports, three paraplegic patients tested the “brain–muscle interface”, where small electrical charges in their legs helped them to move without an exoskeleton. In a study published on May 1, 2021, in Scientific Reports, two patients suffering from chronic paraplegia were shown to be able to walk on 70% of their own weight, in addition to taking 4580 steps, also with the help of non-invasive techniques.\nA study published in 2022 demonstrated the superior clinical effect that the use of non-invasive BMI has compared to putting patients on robots that don't have the same technology. Between 2023 and 2024, Nicolelis began to criticize the company Neuralink, founded by two of his former students. He raised ethical concerns about how the company works, as well as criticizing the way they advertised as new a type of research that Nicolelis' team had already carried out over the previous two decades. Also in 2023, Nicolelis announced the creation of the Nicolelis Institute for Advanced Brain Studies, which aims to bring low-cost solutions, based on BMI, to the treatment of neurological diseases for 1 billion people. The first hub will be created in Milan, Italy, developed with the IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital and the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, as announced in March 2024.\n\n\n== Other research ==\nUnrelated to “Walking Again”, on July 9, 2015, two studies were published in Scientific Reports, demonstrating brain–brain interaction, inside the concept of Brainet.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2010, Nicolelis won the U$S 2.5 million prize from the National Institute of Health, becoming the first Brazilian to receive this award. For his research with BMI, in 2016 Nicolelis won the Daniel E. Noble Award in the category of emerging technologies.\n\n\n== Works ==\nIn 2019, the laboratory responsible for the project published a two-volume compilation of 20 years of scientific articles by the group, which can be downloaded free of charge.\n\n20 Years of Brain–Machine Interface Research.

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Fulltone USA Inc. is an American manufacturer of effects pedals for the electric guitar.  Founded by Michael Fuller in California in 1991, Fulltone was one of the first \"boutique\" pedal companies and became best-known for its overdrive pedals, the Full-Drive and OCD, with the latter dubbed by Music Radar \"one of the most legendary overdrives ever made.\"  \n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early pedals ===\nFulltone found success in the 1990s, largely through print marketing, with the popularity of the brand's Full-Drive line of overdrive pedals.  Fuller continued to expand his company's lineup, adding new overdrives like the Plimsoul and the Clyde wah pedal.\n\nIn 2004, Fulltone released the OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Drive), which was designed by Fuller as \"an open-sounding distortion pedal with decent headroom to more faithfully emulate a driven tube amp,\" with a circuit similar to the earlier Voodoo Labs Overdrive, itself a variation of the Ibanez Tubescreamer.  An op amp-based pedal, the OCD has gone through multiple iterations, with changes from versions 1.1 to 1.7 being generally subtle alterations of the pedal's EQ response.  Version 2 brought more noticeable changes, with a new output buffer, a 2N5457 JFET transistor input stage, and the option to use a new type of switching, enhanced bypass, instead of true bypass.\nAfter the first iteration, the drive pot's value was increased for a more \"dramatic\" distortion, and an asymmetric 1N34 germanium diode was later added to shift the character of the clipping.  The OCD features an HP/LP toggle switch—standing for high-peak/low-peak but often incorrectly assumed to mean high-pass/low-pass.  HP mode adds distortion and presence, as well as a more pointed midrange, while LP mode maintains your amp's character.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nFuller made headlines in 2020 when he made several controversial comments on social media during the George Floyd protests.  In a June 2 post, he stated, \"What is this like night 4 of looting with 100% impunity.  The pussy Mayor and Governor don't give a shit about small businesses, and it's never been more clear.\"  In response to criticism, Fuller added, \"Ahh I feel better, and flushed out some prissy boys who were raised to pee sitting down. Now I'll delete.\"  Fuller deleted the posts but in an email to a customer who characterized Fuller's comments as \"valuing storefronts over police brutality,\" Fuller replied:\n\nI am begging you to sell your pedals because you actually don’t deserve them.  You are actually so racist that you believe the Good people who are protesting are the same as the Organized gang banger criminals who are looting 'store fronts'.\nThose 'store fronts' are good hardworking people's lives and livelihoods. I'm [sic] fact if I see you with a Fulltone pedal I will tag it and break into your house and loot it from you, because its my free expression to do so... right?\nFuller's comments resulted in industry backlash.  Guitar Center announced it would no longer sell Fulltone products in-store or online, while Reverb.com suspended sales of all new and B-stock Fulltone pedals.  Artists like Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 pledged to sell their Fulltone gear and Jason Isbell called Fulltone pedals \"overpriced junk\" while recommending a black-owned pedal company.  The brand's own fan page also condemned the comments.\nFuller subsequently apologized, stating people were \"rightfully pissed off\" at his comments as a \"privileged white guy.\"  He stated his comments were not made at the \"good people\" protesting but rather at the mayor and governor for allowing them to be unfairly arrested while criminals took advantage of the protests to loot stores.  He later deleted his apology.\n\n\n=== Closing ===\nAfter 30 years, the company closed its Culver City production shop in 2022, with Fuller stating that making products entirely in the United States was no longer profitable.  Prices for used Fulltone pedals increased dramatically as a result—as much as 500%. Josh Scott, founder of JHS Pedals, cited Fulltone's closing as the end of the boutique pedal era: \"I think that Fulltone signifies the ending of this era. There’s really nothing left.\"  Despite the factory closing, Fuller stated his intention to continue making pedals in smaller quantities to protect his trademarks and patents.\n\n\n=== Relaunch ===\nFulltone relaunched in partnership with Jackson Audio in 2024, with a new facility in Nashville, Tennessee.  Fuller will continue developing products, while Jackson Audio handles manufacturing and distribution.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site",

        "content": "The Masque of Flowers was an entertainment on 6 January 1614 to celebrate the marriage of Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset and Frances Howard, Countess of Somerset.\n\n\n== Masque for a wedding ==\nThe masque was performed by the gentlemen of Gray's Inn at the Banqueting House at Whitehall Palace. Francis Bacon gave £2000 towards the expenses, refusing an offer of £500 from Henry Yelverton so that he would pay the whole charge and have the honour. Courtiers called it \"Mr Attorney's Masque\". Bacon owed his promotion to Attorney General to Somerset. Flowers was the last of a number of entertainments, including Thomas Campion's The Somerset Masque, Ben Jonson's A Challenge at Tilt and The Irish Masque at Court, and Thomas Middleton's lost Masque of Cupids.\nThe author is unknown. The masque was published with a dedication to Francis Bacon. The music is attributed to John Coprario and John Wilson. James VI and I, Anne of Denmark, and Prince Charles attended and afterwards held a banquet with the performers. \nThe theme has the Sun devise a contest between Winter \"Invierno\" and Spring \"Primavera\". That wine was more worthy than tobacco was debated. Men transformed to flowers would be men again.\nSilenus, companion of Dionysus the ancient god of wine, entered riding an artificial ass. \"Kawasha\" dressed with tobacco leaves was carried into the hall by two actors dressed as the inhabitants of Florida, followed by his sergeant carrying a tobacco pipe as big as a caliver rifle. Thirteen masque dancers represented flowers.\nKawasha was the name of a Native American god of tobacco in Virginia, according to Thomas Harriot. Samuel Purchas described the worship of \"Kiwasa\" in Florida. The wedding entertainments reference colonial enterprise because the bride's father, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, was an investor.\n\n\n== Flower costumes ==\nAccording to the 1614 publication, the flower dancers were \"apparelled in doublets and round hose of white satin; long white silk stockings; white satin pumps; the doublet richly embroidered in curious panes with embossed flowers of silver, the panes bordered with embroidery of carnation silk and silver; the hose cut in panes answerable to the embroidery of the doublets; the skirts of the doublets embroidered and cut into lily-flowers, and the wings set forth with flowers of several colours, made in silk and frosted with silver; ruff-bands edged with a lace of carnation silk and silver, spangled very thick, and stuck full of flowers of several kinds; fair vizards and tresses; delicate caps of silk and silver flowers of sundry kinds, with plumes of the same, in the top whereof stuck a great bunch of egrets; every Masker's pump fastened with a flower suitable to his cap; on their left arms a white scarf fairly embroidered sent them by the Bride, and on their hands a rich pair of embroidered gloves, sent them by the Bridegroom\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe maske of flowers· Presented by the gentlemen of Graies-Inne, at the court of VVhite-hall, in the Banquetting House, vpon Twelfe night, 1613 (London, 1614), text by Early English Books Online\nMasques by the Inns of Court, 1612–1614: REED London",

He started producing automobiles and kits. The brand name is Adam’s. A total of around 15 copies have been created so far.\n\n\n== Vehicles ==\nThe only model is the buggy, an off-road racing car. The four-cylinder engine comes from the Toyota MR2 and is mounted behind the seats. The extremely spartan body is doorless and windowless. It consists mainly of tubes, which also offer a type of rollover protection.\nIn his book A-Z of Kit Cars, Steve Hole depicts a vehicle with the British license plate E860 NWP . The website ukvehicle.com confirms that it is an Adam's Buggy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Pedro Aurélio de Góis Monteiro (12 December 1889 – 16 October 1956) was a Brazilian army general and politician, noted as one of the architects of the Cohen Plan and of the subsequent 1937 Brazilian coup d'état.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPedro Aurélio de Góis Monteiro was born in São Luís do Quitunde, Alagoas. The son of Pedro Aureliano Monteiro dos Santos and Constança Cavalcanti de Góis Monteiro. Coming from a family with military tradition, he began his career at the Porto Alegre War School and reached the rank of army general. Over the years he adopted a loyalist stance when fighting the Copacabana Fort revolt, tenentism and the Prestes Column during the 1920s. The outbreak of the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 led him to exercise military command of it, contributing to its success.\nFrom 1 June 1931 to 25 April 1932, he commanded the 2nd Military Region, based in São Paulo.\nHe also commanded the 1st Military Region, in Rio de Janeiro, between 24 May and 9 July 1932.\nHe then commanded the federal troops that put down the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932 and, during the fighting, he lost his brother, captain Cícero Augusto de Góis Monteiro, who was a member of the 9th Infantry Regiment of the Brazilian Army.\nAfter this event, he was appointed Minister of War in the Getúlio Vargas government, between 18 January 1934 and 7 May 1935, until Eurico Gaspar Dutra was chosen as his successor, which did not prevent Góis Monteiro from actively participating of the establishment and maintenance of the Estado Novo (1937–1945), an event that helped consolidate his family as the dominant political force in Alagoas, a state governed by two of his brothers between 1941 and 1945.\nDemonstrating the fascist stance of Getúlio Vargas' political actors during the Estado Novo, among whom Góis Monteiro was one of the most prominent names, Cláudio de Lacerda Paiva described the Vargas government agents in the following terms: \"the one who censored was Lourival Fontes, the one who tortured was Filinto Muller, the one who instituted fascism was Francisco Campos, the one who carried out the coup was Dutra and the one who supported Hitler was Góis Monteiro\".\nAt the time he was Minister of War, he drafted the National Security Doctrine that inspired several laws in this regard both in the Vargas Era and in the 1964 military regime. In September 1937, Góis Monteiro \"discovered\" the Cohen Plan, which was a false planning, written by the then captain Olímpio Mourão Filho, of a communist revolution in Brazil. This plan was later used by Vargas as justification for the 1937 coup that gave rise to the Estado Novo.\nIn the 1934 indirect presidential election, he came third, winning 4 votes (1.61%).\nGóes Monteiro was Chief of Staff of the Army between 2 July 1937 and 27 December 1943.\nHe returned to the Ministry of War in the last days of Vargas in power, on 9 August 1945. He remained in the position during the José Linhares government and in the first months of the Dutra administration, until 14 October 1946.\nAfter leaving power, he was elected senator for the Social Democratic Party in 1947. In 1945, his brother Ismar de Góis Monteiro had been elected to that same position and in 1958 it was Silvestre Péricles' turn to reach the country's senate. However, in 1950 Pedro Aurélio was unable to be re-elected and even rejected an invitation to be vice-president on the Vargas ticket.\nHe was chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces between 15 February 1951 and 1 December 1952. He was then a justice in the Superior Military Court, from 15 December 1952 until his death on 16 October 1956.\n\n\n== References ==",

The secretariat (SELACC) is also engaged in advocacy, for example concerning the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean Summits as well as in the institutional capacity strengthening of its member organisations.\n\n\n== Membership and structure ==\nUnlike other regions of Caritas Internationalis, such as Caritas Europa with its secretariat in Brussels, or Caritas Africa with its secretariat in Lomé, the secretariat of Caritas Latin America and Caribbean is decentralised, albeit legally registered in San José, Costa Rica. This means that the staff is located in the offices of its various member organisations across the continent.\nThe member organisations are the national Caritas organisations of Latin America. These are subdivided into regional subgroups: Camex for Central America, Caribe for the Caribbean island organisations, Bolivariana for north-eastern South America and Cono Sur for the Southern tip of the continent as well as for Brazil.\nThe country offices of other Caritas organisations, such as of the American Catholic Relief Services or of Caritas Switzerland, are not members of Caritas Latin America and Caribbean.\n\n\n=== List of Member Organisations ===\n\n\n== Leadership ==\n\n\n=== Presidents ===\n?-2007: Gregorio Rosa Chavez\n2007–2012: Fernando María Bargalló\n2012–2023: José Luis Azuaje Ayala\n2023–present: Gustavo Rodríguez Vega\n\n\n=== Regional Coordinators ===\n2003–2007: Francisco Gerardo Hernández Rojas\n2007–2011: Antonio Sandoval\n2011–2023: Francisco Gerardo Hernández Rojas\n2023–present: Nicolás Meyer\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Spanish, English, and Portuguese)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Called Crazy\" is a song by American country music singer Kassi Ashton. It was released on May 6, 2024, as Ashton's third single to country radio. Ashton co-wrote the song with Jared Keim and Emily Weisband, and co-produced it with Luke Laird.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAshton was chosen as Audacy, Inc.'s 'Launch' Artist, lending additional platform support to \"Called Crazy\". In her interview with Audacy's Katie Neal, she described feeling defeated after the COVID-19 pandemic delayed her radio by rollout several years and her prior two radio singles did not chart well, saying when she wrote \"Called Crazy\" with Jared Keim and Emily Weisband that \"if this isn't it, I don't know what is\". Topically, the song is \"a playful look at the truths of modern-day dating\" born out of Ashton's realization that the guys who called her crazy are the ones who always call her back: \"This wasn't some fancy hook or poetic notion that I stumbled across, it was just the cold hard truth hit me one day. Every man that's ever called me crazy just keeps calling — so does that mean I'm crazy, or does that mean that they're crazy?\"\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"Called Crazy\" debuted at number 53 on Billboard Country Airplay ahead of its release as a single, and pulled in adds from 43 stations by its impact date. It became her first song to enter the top 40 of the chart in its seventh chart week.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The Chin Brotherhood Alliance, aided by the Arakha Army and People's Defense Force, started attacking Myanmar Army positions on December 22, 2023. Initially intending to capture the town by Christmas, constant airstrikes, heavy fire from entrenched junta forces, and ambushes by pro-junta militias impeded rebel efforts. After four months of constant fighting, anti-junta forces completely captured the town. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Axel Viehweger (born 27 November 1952) is a German housing cooperative functionary and former politician.\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as Minister for Construction, Urban Development and Housing of the GDR in the cabinet of Lothar de Maizière.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nViehweger attended the Extended Secondary School (EOS) and completed his high school diploma.\nFrom 1973 to 1978, he studied Energy Engineering and Nuclear Physics at the Dresden University of Technology, which he completed a with a degree in physics (Dipl.-Phys.). He then worked at the university's Institute of Energetics, from 1984 to 1985 as a research associate. He obtained his doctorate (Dr.-Ing.) in 1985 on the topic \"A Contribution to Determining 'Favorable' Hydraulic Operating Regimes for Hot Water District Heating Networks in Emergency Conditions or Planned Shutdowns\".\n\n\n=== Bloc party politician ===\nViehweger joined the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD), an East German bloc party beholden to the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED), in 1970.\nParallel to his academic career, Viehweger became active in local politics. From 1979 to 1985, he was a member of the District Assembly of Dresden-West. From 1981 to 1985, he additionally was chairman of the Dresden-West LDPD and from 1986 to 1990, chairman of the Dresden LDPD.\nIn 1985, he was made full-time city councilor (member of the municipal government) for energy of Dresden, a position he held until 1990. He later described his work there as \"Saving electricity, distributing coal\".\n\n\n=== de Maizière Government ===\nAfter the Wende, the LDP, its new name after being renamed in February 1990, joined forces with the other liberal parties in the GDR to form the Association of Free Democrats (BFD). Viehweger became a member of the executive committee of the BFD.\nFrom April to September 1990, Viehweger served as the last Minister for Construction, Urban Development and Housing in the cabinet of Lothar de Maizière. Despite the BFD leaving the government coalition in July 1990, Viehweger remained minister.\nAs Minister, Viehweger was mainly tasked with renovating the crumbling cities and introducing market economy principles in this sector, including liberalizing the construction industry and creating a free housing market. Of the approximately 4,500 employees, almost 90% are laid off or outsourced to other institutions. The numerous research institutes assigned to the ministry, such as the GDR Construction Academy, were either be dissolved or transferred to other legal entities by 3 October 1990. The housing construction combines, which were also under the responsibility of the ministry, were taken over by the Treuhandanstalt.\nHe resigned from his position on 28 September 1990, following the disclosure of allegations of now disproven collaboration with the Stasi under the pseudonym \"Jens Grabowski,\" as well as the recommendation for immediate resignation. As a city councilor in Dresden, he is said to have maintained contacts with the Stasi. Viehweger admitted this, but denied having signed an IM declaration and passing on documents.\n\n\n=== Reunified Germany ===\nDespite the allegations, he remained the lead candidate of the Saxon FDP for the inaugural state election on 14 October 1990.\nDuring the first legislative period, he was a member of the Saxon State Parliament from 1990, elected from the state list of the FDP. According to a report in the Sächsische Zeitung on 13 November 1990, Viehweger was on leave from his parliamentary mandate until March 1991 \"at the request of the FDP parliamentary group and after a conversation with the FDP federal chairman Graf Lambsdorff\" until the Stasi allegations against him were clarified.\nOn 4 November 1991, Viehweger was expelled from the parliamentary group. Subsequently, he resigned from the FDP and remained a member of the state parliament as an independent member for the rest of the legislative period ending in 1994.\nAlready during the legislative period, Viehweger began working in various positions in the housing industry. From 2000 to 2002 he was head of the Central and Eastern Europe working group of CECODHAS (Association of the European Social Housing Industry). From 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2019, Viehweger was director and board member of the Association of Saxon Housing Cooperatives.\nOn 11 October 2022, Viehweger was elected chairman of the Volkssolidarität Dresden e.V. He currently lives in Berlin-Wilhelmsruh.\n\n\n== References ==",

The village belonged to the Eisfeld district and was historically characterised by forestry and timber processing. Sulphur gravel was also mined in the 17th century. Other economic activities included linen weaving, yeast trading and two grinding mills. In 1666 there were 175 inhabitants, by 1852 there were already 787. Industrialisation had a particular impact on the local wood processing industry, with the mills becoming sawmills with associated timber production. In 1636, Gießübel established its own school, which paved the way for eight other schools in the area. The new school was built and completed in 1900. A glassworks was also operated after 1918. \nThere was little tourism before the Second World War, but this began to expand during the communist era. The local cultural centre (opened in 1956) was the first cultural centre in the Upper Forest region. There were also smiths, wainwrights, turners, wheelwrights, charcoal burners, blacksmiths, locksmiths, nail smiths, carpenters, joiners and miners. Woodworking and glass production continued and an electrical company was opened. \nOn 25 March 1994, Gießübel merged with three surrounding communities to form the new municipality of Schleusegrund.\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Gießübel (Schleusegrund) at Wikimedia Commons",

According to his interview, he had an agreement with his older brother Andrii he competes in the same weight category with that the latter would try to qualify for the 2024 Summer Olympics (which he did not manage to achieve) and he would try to qualify for the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArtem Harbar ranking at World Taekwondo\nArtem Harbar at TaekwondoData.com\nArtem Harbar at the website of the Taekwondo Federation of Ukraine",

Accordingly, the spatial extent of the area covered by the definition was dynamic, getting smaller as time went on. This period is also distinct for the sources recording its history.\nAs an analytical construct, it overlaps with the later stages of the Ottoman Empire, from about 1750 until its dissolution following the end of the First World War. This period was characterized with increased foreign, primarily European, intervention, outside invasions, the Tanzimat reforms, social modernization, economic globalization, improvements in communications and transportation infrastructure, and political change. \n\n\n== Rerefences ==",

        "content": "The Object is a 2024 hard first contact science fiction novel written by Joshua T. Calvert. It is about a scientist who discovers an extrasolar object which has entered the Solar System under mysterious circumstances.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDr. Melody \"Mel\" Adams is a scientist working at a NASA base in Hawaii. In January 2023, she discovers a strange object near Pluto, which is initially thought to be a comet due to a glow around the object and an elongation assumed to be the tail of the comet. However, Mel realizes that the object which she calls the \"visitor\" might be an extrasolar spaceship. She proposes this theory in a book titled Extraterrestrial, which becomes a best-seller. However, she is expelled from NASA due to her ideas.\nTwo years later, amidst a talk show, members of the Secret Service come to take Mel. She meets Jim Rothman, the Administrator of NASA, whom she secretly loves. He confirms that her hypothesis was correct, and NASA is planning to set up a combined mission with the ESA at Houston to research the object, which is named \"Serenity\". They receive the support of President Brosnahan. Mel is recruited back into NASA, but cannot become an astronaut, because years before, in the astronaut examination, another candidate named Bernard had cheated, stealing her spot. Serenity momentarily disappears behind Saturn's icy rings, but soon appears again.\nSoon, a manned mission to Serenity is planned, and a team of six astronauts including Bernard, Dr. Selena Rogerton, Gabriella Mancarella and Dr. Thomas \"Tom\" Ehrmann. Due to political reasons, the Chinese also decide to collaborate, and so two of the astronauts are replaced by Chinese taikonauts, Col. Ye Zhigang and Col. Wang Hongbo. Bernard is injured and is replaced by Melody, who is also the commander of the mission.\nA spaceship called Pangaea or Pangu Dalu in Mandarin, is built, and is launched in 2031. It is designed to land on Serenity which is fast approaching Mars. During an EVA, Gabriella is killed by micrometeorites. Aboard the ship, Mel, Tom, Selena and Hongbo experience the same dream of floating in deep space. Pangaea lands on the rotating Serenity, and the astronauts begin studying its nature. Tom reveals that is covered by diatoms and polyps and appears to be bionic.\nA hole is created on the surface. Mel, Tom, Selena and Hongbo enter the hole, while Zhigang stays aboard Pangaea. The astronauts are attacked by a black fluid and discover that the hole has been sealed by a callus. Selena dies due to impact after falling, and is covered by green snail-like pustules.\nThe astronauts explore the network of tunnels and realize that the black fluid flows with a periodic tremor and air-flow every 11 minutes 8 seconds. Mel slips and enters a large chamber containing a tree-like neural structure with slow blue-colored flashes of light. Hongbo reaches there too, but after cutting some flesh, is thrown into the network and dies. Her suit is damaged by the green snails which enter inside and cover her corpse.\nMel escapes from the chamber. She meets Tom and they fire a rope to the callus using a potato cannon. When the rope begins shaking, Tom boosts it up again, while the gas throws Melody into Serenity. They realize that Serenity is an organism with a brain, blood vessels, immune cells, etc., but a slow metabolism to facilitate interstellar travel. The dreams might serve as a form of communication from Serenity's side.\nMel enters the brain chamber and sees that Hongbo's suit and MMU have disappeared. She makes actions indicating greetings, and Hongbo's corpse appears to mimic those, while blue flashes flow through the network below her. Mel's mind is transmitted inside a virtual chamber in Serenity's brain, after the green \"slugs\" enter her body. She meets Serenity, who has assumed Hongbo's form to communicate with her. Serenity reveals that it is a living fully-conscious biological probe, developed by an intelligent species in the distant past to collect data about other intelligent species. This data is sent to a \"Data Center\" where the species shifted after a gamma ray burst destroyed their home. Serenity had traveled for eons, and had encountered many species, but due to the damage caused by humans, it had only fifty years to live. It reveals that for it, time appears to pass very quickly. Mel is given temporary control of her body, and she uses her spacesuit equipment to contact Zhigang and Tom, who are on the way back to Earth on Pangaea. They continue to monitor her audio and visual system. Mel returns to the virtual chamber and contacts Serenity in Hongbo's form, to ask it about the dreams. Serenity reveals that the dreams were a form of quantum entanglement communication system.\nIn the epilogue, it is revealed that Tom has lived to the age of 140 years. Fujao is the Secretary-General of the United Nations and has set up many \"dream centers\" based on knowledge received from Mel's audio and video system. He has set up a mission Pangaea II in honor of the astronauts who are regarded as heroes. The mission is launched from the Wang Hongbo Center in Texas. Finally, Tom dies peacefully, ending the story.\n\n\n=== Main characters ===\nLt. Col.

        "content": "Battle of Monastyryshche - is one of the battles of the Ukrainian Cossack - peasant army during the Khmelnytsky Uprising near the town of Monastyryshche of the Bratslav Regiment of the Hetmanship, which ended Cossack victory.\n\n\n== Forces ==\nAt the time of the Battle of Monastryshche in the spring of 1653, there were about 2.5 thousand Cossacks under the command of Ivan Bohun . Taking into account the spring roadlessness, flooding of rivers and streams, as well as the considerable distance between hundreds, as well as diseases and other important reasons, the Cossacks of the Kalnytskyi regiment did not have the physical opportunity to arrive at the assembly points on time. Under such critical conditions, Ivan Bohun was able to gather only the nearest hundreds of Cossacks. Polish tycoon Stefan Czarnecki was considered one of the best generals of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for a reason. Being quite a strategist, he predicted these circumstances in advance. Therefore, the corps led by him advanced \"Black Path\" through the territory of the Kalnytskyi regiment in March 1653 almost without obstacles.\nIt is estimated that the Polish forces numbered around 8,000 soldiers at the Battle of Monastyryshche. It was one of the battles that took place without the participation of the hussars, instead of which about 1,000 dragoons took part in the battle. On the Cossack side, on the other hand, the vast majority were Cossack cavalry. Castellan Stephan Czarnetski went to the Cossacks. Ukraine. After merging with the regiments of S. Hurski and S. Machowski in the town of Pavloch (now a village in the Popilninsk district, Zhytomyr region), their number rose to 20,000 men (including servants). However, this is not the exact number of Czarnetsky's troops, as it is  really known how many men there were in Czarnetsky's army probably 8,000 acording polish sources , certainly more than in Bohun's army, which was also worth noting that the Cossacks could count on the support of 70,000 citizens from the town.\n\n\n== Before Battle ==\nTo frighten the Cossacks, Czarnetsky ordered the territory to be ransacked 'with fire and sword'. Men and women, children and old people were brutally tortured, hanged and impaled. Property was looted, houses burned.... Flying Polish troops destroyed small Cossack outposts and fortified towns. In this way the small Cossack strongholds of Samhorodok , Pogrebyszcze , Pryluka , Lypovets and many other Cossack villages and farms were burned to the ground. Colonel Ivan Bohun found out about the massive enemy attack through his territory already when the Poles were practically \"at the threshold\" of the regimental town of Kalnyk .\nThere was no time for meetings, as almost all Cossacks were at home in the early spring. Surprised Colonel Ivan Bohun sent messengers to the hundreds closest to Kalnyk to block the advance of Polish units along the \"Black Road\" to Humania . According to the alert, only three hundred Cossacks from the Kalnitsa regiment had gathered : one hundred from Kalytsky , Balabanov and Terlytsky and one hundred from Cybulivsky of the Umansky regiment, i.e. a total of about 400 Cossacks or vesrion say about 1000 cossacks with 70,000 citieziens from city. With such a small detachment at his disposal, Colonel Ivan Bohun , being one of the best strategists of the Zaporozhian Army, made the only right decision - to block the \"Black Road\" towards Humansk .\n\n\n== Battle ==\n\n\n=== Ukrainian version ===\nFrom inside the fortress it was defended by a hundred Tsybulovs from the Uman centurion regiment of Kgrozdenko and part of Ivan Bohun's cavalry . After the two-day assault, according to Samiylo Velychko , the Poles set fire to the palisade in several places and also set fire to the castle. At night, under the cover of smoke thickly enveloping the fortress and the surrounding area, Ivan Bohun led about a hundred cavalry from the Avram Fortress. This small detachment of Cossacks dressed in coats with wool turned up in the Tatar fashion and made their way to the rear of the Poles, using the 'Galay Dam', which connected the village to the fortress by a deep ravine. The Cossacks, together with Bohun, struck the Poles in the rear at the most dramatic moment of the battle. This is how the participants of this battle - Polish noblemen W. Kahowski and Twardowski - write about it : \"The army broke into the suburbs, they had already captured the fortress rampart, the centurion of Kgrozdenko had already been killed, they had already seen the keel (rampart). Everyone hoped that the city would soon be captured...\". Shlyachtych Twardowski also recalled that terror gripped the Polish army after the unexpected appearance of Ivan Bohun at the rear of the Polish convoy.\nCzarniecki then started to move into the city with his army, but a shot from an ambulance wounded him and the army was left without a commander, which caused panic. Taken from his horse, Czarniecki regained consciousness and was about to say \"Has the city been taken?\" and the ldiers replied that the capture of the city had failed.\nThe escape route of the Crown army ran along a road past the Cossack settlement of Letychowka and a dense oak forest. For six versts (about 7 km) the entire road towards the century-old town of Tsibulow , where the Poles slumbered \"all the way to the forest\", was littered with the bodies of German mercenaries and Polish honour guards, chopped to stumps.\nSamiylo Velikhko reports that the Poles fled in panic towards the town of Tsibuli and gives as Polish losses more than 6,000 dead and their abandoned wagon near Monastrichia. The Polish flags, although panicked, became frightened but did not completely lose control. Retreating from the blanks, they performed the so-called retreat manoeuvre. Fleeing in the direction of the Cossack settlement of Tsibul , they turned along a forest road along a branch of the \"Sokolovskaya Path\", now passing through the village of Antonina to cross and ford the Girski Tikicz in the area of the village of Kniaża Krynica , in order to be able to continue plundering unburned Cossack villages and manors, capturing provisions for soldiers and fodder for horses. The remnants of the Polish penal corps reoccupied the \"Black Road\" and hurriedly marched to Volhynia, to the border of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but this is t quite true as witnesses reported much smaller losses.\n\n\n=== Polish version ===\nPolish version says the same mileage only with the Hussars did not take part in the battle, as Ukrainian historians claim, and in addition that Bohun fled the battlefield and did not fight to the end according to the Ukrainian version.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIvan Bohun managed to leave Monastyryshche with part of his army, while the rest stayed to defend the castle. As Wespazjan Kochowski wrote years later, this was probably a deliberate manoeuvre to help the defenders. However, the commander of the Polish troops, Stefan Czarniecki, was wounded during the fighting, which may have determined the final defeat of the Poles in the Battle of Monastyryshche.\n\n\n== Controversy about the Battle ==\n\n\n=== lies about the number of soldiers ===\nDuring the Khmelnytsky Uprising in March 1653, the Battle of Monastyryshche took place. The town, defended by Ivan Bohun, was besieged by the Polish army of Stefan Czarniecki. The Poles suffered defeat and ceased hostilities for a time. In connection with the 360th anniversary of the battle, celebrations were held in Ukraine, honoured with a show by historical re-enactors. What the re-enactment looked like can be seen in a video posted on YouTube on 22 March. It shows hussars being defeated by Cossacks fighting on horseback. Konstantin Olejnik also posted an article about the battle on the website of the Ukrainian open-air museum Mamajeva Sloboda.\n\n\n=== lies about the hussars taking part in the battle ===\nPolish historians are rubbing their eyes in amazement. According to Dr Radoslaw Sikora, author of the book \"Hussars under Vienna\", the best-known expert on the Hussar army, the number of errors and falsifications during the show and in Olejnik's article is overwhelming. - Firstly, the Polish army did not have 15,000 soldiers. According to Joachim Jerlicz (his brother Maciej fought and died there), there were 8,000. This can be taken as the actual state of this army,\" Dr Sikora assesses in an interview with the NaszDziennik.pl portal.\n\n\n=== Number soldiers of Bohun and his taking part in battle ===\nThe third misrepresentation concerns the whole context of the battle, which weakens the overtones of the 'victory' of Bohdan Khmelnytsky's Cossacks. - Before the battle of Monasterzys, the Polish army clashed with Bohun's 5000-8000 army at Kalnik. The Poles won this clash. The Cossacks saved themselves by fleeing. Thanks to this, Stefan Czarniecki, who commanded the Poles, captured Kalnik, Ilińce and Bałabanówka,\" says Dr Sikora. He points out that Bohun's army then retreated to Monasterzysk. - This town was defended by many more than the 400 Cossacks mentioned in the account. There were masses of commoners even counted (probably with considerable exaggeration) at 70 000 These 400 Cossacks, who were supposed to have driven the Polish army away, are a number taken completely from the ceiling. Not only does it not appear in the sources, but it contradicts them,\" notes the historian. He points out that Monasterzys, which was surrounded by a rampart, moat and palisade, was taken by storm by the Poles. - Then some of the defenders locked themselves in the castle, which was within the town, and the others, led by Bohun, left Monasterzysk. This begs the question: what for? To fight the Poles? There is no mention of such a battle in the sources. So the clash between mounted Cossacks and hussars presented during the event is pure fiction - he stresses. According to him, many years after these events, Wespazjan Kochowski wrote that Bohun was a deliberate manoeuvre to somehow help the defenders. - Historians speculate whether this might have been a demonstration of the approaching relief effort. However, Joachim Jerlicz His brother Maciej fought at Monasterzysk), Samuel Twardowski and even the Ruthenian chronicler Samiilo Velychko state that Bohun simply fled the town! There was no talk of any battle. All the more about 400 Cossacks defeating 15,000 Polish soldiers,\" he states.Samiilo Velychko about escape : Bohun saw his own danger in this tumultuous chaos and, having left his army in the smoke of gunpowder and the thunder of muskets, got out of Monastyrys and headed for Khmelnytsky. Bohunov's army was in good shape, defended itself bravely with the rest of the officers and killed another thousand and a half soldiers, while Czerniecki himself was left hard done by in these battles\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nStefan Czarniecki  urywek historyczny 1891 - Jenike, Ludwik\nJam nie z soli ani z roli....

Members provide advise on every aspect of stamp collecting as well as friendship, knowledge and experience.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe members of the NHPS are located throughout the USA.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe NHPS was established on October 15, 1914, at 831 Chapel Street, the brainchild of six collectors—Edwin B. Brown, William F. Bishop, William H. Hitchings, Fred G. Simpson, Robert E. Hall, and F. G. Parker. Edwin B. Brown and F. G. Parker were early stamp dealers.\nThe NHPS is not the oldest stamp club in the United States, but is the oldest that has met continually since its founding. A New Haven chapter of the Brothers of Philately had been active for 10 to 15 years, making the NHPS the second club formed in New Haven. When the Brothers disbanded, some of the members joined NHPS. The New Haven Women's Philatelic Society merged with the Hew Haven Philatelic Society in the 1970s.\nIn 1972 NHPS founded the Southern New England Stamp Exhibition (SONEX) which ran for many years. In the 1990s NHPS became co-host of a monthly stamp show, and became sole host in the in the mid 2005. The fourth Monthly Stamp Show is held at the YMA Annex Club at 554 Woodward Avenue, New Haven, CT.\n\n\n== APS Charter member ==\nThe NHPS has been a charter member of the American Philatelic Society since 1947.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nThe society operates by its set of by-laws. Elected officers are the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and members of the executive board. \n\n\n== Weekly business meeting ==\nNHPS Holds a weekly stamp business meeting, auction and program. Programs range from trivia night to general discussions on stamps where the membership assist other collectors with questions.\n\n\n== Quarterly newsletter ==\nThe society issues a quarterly newsletter called “The Postmaster”. Copies available on the website.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmerican Philatelic Research Library\nAmerican Philatelic Society Hall of Fame\nThe American Philatelist\nList of stamp clubs and philatelic societies in the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

Sukat spent most of his career in the Siliwangi (West Java) Regional Military Command and was the commander of the Majalengka military district from April to September 1962 with the rank of captain. As a lieutenant colonel, Sukat was transferred to the Jakarta Regional Military Command as the commander of the Bekasi military district. He was replaced from the position in July 1966.\nIn 1967, Subandi was assigned to civilian office as the regent of Bekasi. During his six-year rule, Subandi oversaw the development of Bekasi's agriculture. He instructed historians to trace back Bekasi's history, which resulted in a book on Bekasi's history, and ordered the construction of a monument to commemorate Bekasi's heroes in 1971.\nSubandi was replaced from his office on 9 November 1973. He returned to the military with the rank of colonel and was appointed as the inspector of the Jakarta Regional Military Command. He died on 17 November 1985 and was buried at the Cikutra Heroes' Cemetery in Bandung.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "For another meaning, see NATO phonetic alphabet, APCO radiotelephony spelling alphabet\nIn Russian phonology and in some other languages, a phonetic word (Russian: фонетическое слово, French: mot phonétique) is a sequence of morphemes clustered around one nuclear stress. A phonetic word may contain more than one lexical item.\n\n\n== Russian language ==\nIt may consist of a single content word and adjacent clitics (function words). It may include a proclitic (на диване, on the sofa), an enclitic (читал бы, \"whether <someone> would read\"), or even both: у нас бы, по Москве ли.\nIn most cases an accent falls on a syllable of the content word, never on the enclitic, and in rare cases it may fall on the proclitic leaving the content word unstressed: на горе́ (on a hill) vs. на́ гору (onto a hill). In modern standard Russian there is a tendency to abandon putting accent on the proclitic. Still, this is preserved in phraseologisms, such as поверить на́ слово (\"take the word\") or схватиться за́ голову (\"to become puzzled, scared\", \"to repent or become sorry belatedly\", literally \"to clutch one's own head\").\nThe unstressed content words are the vestige of the Old East Slavic/protoslavic prosodic feature called  enclinomenon (w:ru:энклиномен), a word or group of words without stress.\nThe concept of the phonetic word is important because  quality, intensity and duration of vowels in unstressed syllables (vowel reduction) depend on their location in relation to this stressed syllable.\nThe concept of phonetic word should not be confused with loss of stress in rhythmic speech, e.g., in poetry, in trisyllabic metrical feet:\n\nНе спеши́ написа́ть мне не то́\nЕсть прокля́тье заве́тов свяще́нных\n\n\n== French language ==\nIn French language the concept of mot phonétique (also translated as phonological phrase) was introduced by François Wioland in 2005. \n\n Les mots phonétiques sont des unités minimales de production et de perception qui signifient, que l’on peut observer dans les communications verbales, sans référence consciente à l’écrit, comme le sont les échanges et dialogues spontanés,  soit présentiels, soit téléphoniques\n(Phonetic words are minimal units of production and perception which have a definite meaning, which can be observed in verbal communications, without conscious reference to writing, as are spontaneous exchanges and dialogues, either face-to-face or by telephone.)\nA phonemic word has the following characteristics:\n\nIt contains a small number of syllables\nInternal syllables are less important for understanding and the meaning is clear from the context\nThe last syllable is pronounced stressed (accented and prolonged)\nExamples:\n\nSingle-syllable: oui, vous\nTwo-syllable: bonjour; sans blaque! - Stress: da daaa\nThree-syllable tout a fait; au retour - Stress: da da daaa\nFour-syllable: sans aucun dute  - Stress: da da da daaa\nSix-syllable: il est American  - Stress: da da da da da daaa\nExamples of  phrases that consist of two three-syllable phonetic words: \"ces enfants sont petits\"; \"il est bon en français\"; \"vous avez entendu?\"\nMots phonétiques can have secondary accents. However the syllable preceding the main accent completely loses its accent. Also, accents tend to alternate, i.e., there will be a sequence of unaccented sylables, rather than a sequence of accented syllables. This principle is called \"accent clash avoidance.\" According to this principle, if an utterance is grammatically split into, e.g., two mots phonétiques, then if the second one is monosyllable, the two pronounced as one mot phonétique.\nMots phonétiques should be distinguished from rhythmic groups (groupes rythmiques).\n\n\n== See also ==\nStress in Russian language\nSyntagma (linguistics)\nPhonological word\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Göhrde hunting lodge (German: Jagdschloss Göhrde)) is a former hunting lodge in Göhrde, Lower Saxony in Germany. The Göhrde State Forest was once a favourite hunting ground of the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Later the kings of Hannover also hunted here and – to 1918 – the German emperors as well.\nAs Elector of Hanover, king George I of Great Britain (1660–1727) built a baroque style palace here between 1706 and 1709 by the architects Louis Remy de la Fosse and Johann Christian Böhm. The palace was timber framed and in bad repair by the early 19th century. In 1827, it was taken down. The German Emperors redeveloped the former stables in a new hunting lodge.\nAfter the First World War, the hunting lodge served as a seminary and school. Today, it is privately owned and in poor condition. Almost nothing remembers anymore of the 18th century splendour.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== A royal hunting lodge for king George I ===\n\nThe Göhrde forests are located near the Elbe river between Lüneburg and Dannenberg. The forests were a favourite hunting ground of the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and later Electors of Hanover. Already as of 16th century, there was a hunting lodge.\nKing George I was a passionate hunter. It was said that he ‘had no other pleasure but the hunt’. In 1706, he decided to expand the existing infrastructure: the existing lodge was to be replaced by a new palace. In addition, various new outbuildings were added as well, such as new stables, a theatre, a bakery and an abattoir. Construction costed 83,000 talers and it was the king's most elaborate and major construction project.\nThe palace designs were made by the court architect Louis Remy de la Fosse, with assistance of Johann Christian Böhm. Construction started in 1706 and was completed in 1710. The palace was a compact three story building and slightly lower side wings, which contained at least 48 apartments to accommodate guests. Ancestral portraits from Henry the Lion (1129/1131-1195) onwards decorated the palace walls. The royal stables could house more than 500 horses. In addition, there were also dog kennels.\nThe hunting lodge in Göhrde was the scene of large ‘par force’ hunts. These were grand theatrical events, meticulously planned to demonstrate power and greatness. King George I and his guests participated in the hunt, or positioned themselves centrally in the forest while they waited to be summoned. Meanwhile, the mounted hunters and their hounds pursued the day's quarry. From their waiting place, the king and his guests could watch the hunters, horses and hounds as they persecuted the frantic stag at great speed. When the exhausted stag was no longer able to run, the dogs held it fast by biting its throat, ears, legs and muzzle. Thus, the stag was “fixed” and the king was summoned with a special horn signal. He carried out his duty as the master of the hunt by killing the stag with a stab wound to the heart.\nWith the accession of king George to the throne of the United Kingdom in 1714, the Personal union of Great Britain and Hanover started. The king relocated to London and the large hunting parties in Göhrde were reduced to a few events, but they were still there. The king liked to go from time to time to Hanover. In 1725, king George I entertained king Frederick William I of Prussia (1688–1740) at Göhrde.\n\n\n==== Gallery: the Göhrde palace in the time of king George I – around 1715 ====\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Second half of the 18th century: not used and decay ===\nBetween 1756 and 1765, Benjamin Hase drew various site plans of the palace complex, which are preserved in the British Map Library. Although Göhrde remained a royal hunting property from 1766 onwards, it was no longer used for hunting when king George III (1738–1820) ordered the hunting rights in Göhrde to be leased, but no lessee was found. The palace also remained unused and was left to decay.\nIn 1772, the exiled Danish queen Caroline Matilda (1751–1775) used the castle as a temporary residence before moving into Celle Castle, where she died only 23 years old.\n\n\n=== 19th century: new revival as a royal and imperial hunting lodge ===\n\nThe timber framed palace was in bad repair by the early 19th century. In 1827, king George IV (1762–1830) decided to take down the palace. The salvageable material was auctioned off, covering about 10 percent of the original construction cost. Only the large royal stable and a Cavalier house were repaired to serve occasional hunting purposes.\nIt was not until the return of a new king to Hanover, Ernest Augustus (1771–1851), in 1837 that the place revived. Ownership of the property passed to the German emperor William I (1797–1888) in 1866, who carried out some major renovations and expansions. The former stables were turned into a new hunting lodge, which could serve as a new centre of hunting parties.\nThe last major imperial hunt took place here in 1913 with a large party attended by emperor Wilhelm II (1859–1941).\n\n\n=== 20th century: seminary and school ===\n\nAfter the First World War, the palace served as a recreation home for civil servants, and from 1929 as a seminary for vicars of the Hanoverian State Church. In 1939, the contract with the State Church was terminated; the church should no longer benefit from state institutions. Thus, the vicars had to move to the existing seminary in Loccum in 1940.\nThe hunting lodge was now intended to be used as a National Socialist educational institution for female teachers. This did not happen, and after 1946, the building became an educational centre (German: Heimvolkshochschule Jagdschloss Göhrde). Among other events, the 23rd meeting of Group 47 took place here in October 1961 with the author and poet Hans Magnus Enzensberger as the speaker.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nIn 1997, the Lüneburg (region) declared the hunting lodge as state-owned property dispensable, which was confirmed by the Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture. Due to reasons of prudent financial management, the sale of the property, which was in need of renovation, became necessary. After years without a buyer, the listed castle complex was sold at the end of 2005 to private owner for 30,000 euros. This also transferred the obligation to preserve the castle as a cultural monument, as contained in the Lower Saxony Monument Protection Act, to the buyer. After the sale, there was a dispute over the use due to unclear ownership.\nToday, it is privately owned and in poor condition and deteriorating. During winter, the buildings are not heated, due to cost saving reasons. The owner does not allow local authorities and conservationists to enter the property, so they are not able to assess what the current status is.  Almost nothing remembers anymore of the 18th century splendour.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nvon dem Bussche-Münch, Wilhelm (1842). \"Nachrichten über das vormalige Jagdschloß und das Jagdhaus zur Göhrde\".

Members provide advise on every aspect of stamp collecting as well as friendship, knowledge and experience.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe members of the NHPS are located throughout the USA. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe NHPS was established on October 15, 1914, at 831 Chapel Street, the brainchild of six collectors—Edwin B. Brown, William F. Bishop, William H. Hitchings, Fred G. Simpson, Robert E. Hall, and F. G. Parker. Edwin B. Brown and F. G. Parker were early stamp dealers.\nThe NHPS is not the oldest stamp club in the United States, but is the oldest that has met continually since its founding. A New Haven chapter of the Brothers of Philately had been active for 10 to 15 years, making the NHPS the second club formed in New Haven. When the Brothers disbanded, some of the members joined NHPS. The New Haven Women's Philatelic Society merged with the Hew Haven Philatelic Society in the 1970's.\nIn 1972 NHPS founded the Southern New England Stamp Exhibition (SONEX) which ran for many years. In the 1990's NHPS became co-host of a monthly stamp show, and became sole host in the in the mid 2005. The fourth Monthly Stamp Show is held at the YMA Annex Club at 554 Woodward Avenue, New Haven, CT.\n\n\n== APS Charter member ==\nThe NHPS has been a charter member of the American Philatelic Society since 1947.\n\n\n== Weekly business meeting ==\nNHPS Holds a weekly stamp business meeting, auction and program. Programs range from trivia night to general discussions on stamps where the membership assist other collectors with questions. \n\n\n== Quarterly newsletter ==\nThe society issues a quarterly newsletter called “The Postmaster”.",

        "content": "Seodaemun A (Korean: 서대문구 갑) is a constituency of the National Assembly of South Korea. The constituency consists of parts of Seodaemun District, Seoul. As of 2024, 130,042 eligible voters were registered in the constituency. The constituency was created in 1988 from the Seodaemun–Eunpyeong constituency.\n\n\n== History ==\nThroughout its history, Seodaemun A has elected members of both liberal and conservative parties to represent the constituency. Accordingly, Seodaemun A has historically been considered a bellwether constituency by political analysts. However, in recent elections the Democratic Party has been dominant with four consecutive wins in the constituency. Therefore, some analysts consider the constituency as becoming a stronghold for the Democratic Party.\nKang Seong-mo of the right-wing Democratic Justice Party was the first member to represent the constituency having won with 37.04% of the vote. Kang lost his bid for re-election and was succeeded by Kim Sang-hyun of the centre-left Democratic Party. Kim won re-election in 1996 but was not re-nominated ahead of the 2000 election. He was succeeded by Lee Sung-heon of the centre-right Grand National Party who won in a tight race against Woo Sang-ho of the Millennium Democratic Party. Lee Sung-heon and Woo Sang-ho would continue to face off in rematches in Seodaemun A as the mainstream conservative and liberal party candidates respectively until the 2020 South Korean legislative election.\nIn the 2004 South Korean legislative election, Woo Sang-ho of the Uri Party narrowly defeated incumbent Lee Sung-heon by a margin of 1,899 votes. However, in the following election held in 2008, Lee won the seat back by a wide margin and securing 51.64% of the vote. In the 2012 election, Woo won the seat back, securing 54.36% of the vote in a one-on-one battle against Lee Sung-heon. Woo won re-election in 2016 and 2020 with 54.88% and 53.24% of the vote respectively, defeating former assemblyman Lee Sung-heon in both matches.\nAhead of the 2024 South Korean legislative election, Woo Sang-ho announced that he would not be standing for re-election in Seodaemun A. After holding a party primary, the Democratic Party nominated lawyer Kim Dong-ah as the party's candidate for the constituency on March 11, 2024. Kim Dong-ah went on to win the general election with 50.75% of the vote, defeating Lee Yong-ho of the People Power Party.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe constituency encompasses the neighborhoods of Hongje 1-dong, Hongje 2-dong, Bugahyeon-dong, Cheonyeon-dong, Chunghyeon-dong, Sinchon-dong, and Yeonhui-dong. It borders the constituencies of Seodaemun B to the north, Mapo B to the west, Mapo A to the south, Jung–Seongdong B and Jongno to the east.\n\n\n== List of members of the National Assembly ==\n\n\n== Election results ==\n\n\n=== 2024 ===\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n=== 1996 ===\n\n\n=== 1992 ===\n\n\n=== 1988 ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of constituencies of the National Assembly of South Korea\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

These trees may have survived the Pennsylvania logging era of the late 1800s. The area is only accessible via unmarked paths from a nearby gravel road.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hudson Bay Capital Management (HBC) is an American multi-strategy investment management firm headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nThe firm has no relation to Canada's more well-known Hudson's Bay Company.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1997, Sander Gerber, an equity options trader at American Stock Exchange started his own proprietary firm named Gerber Asset Management. In 2005, he and Yoav Roth founded Hudson Bay Capital. At the same time, Gerber Asset Management was dissolved and Hudson Bay Capital absorbed its resources and employees.\nIn 2013, HBC was one of over twenty companies accused by the U.S. SEC of violating short-selling regulations, specifically Rule 105 of Regulation M, and among majority of those accused to settle with the agency rather than fight the charges through litigation. The settlement cost HBC almost US$950,000.\nIn March 2020, HBC introduced a special share class based on a drawdown structure to take advantage of sharp share price decreases following recent historic highs.\nIn February 2022, HBC received a $1.3 million state grant from the state of Connecticut to hire an addition 40 employees in Greenwich.\nIn February 2024, HBC raised over $800 million for a special situations fund. It was a closed-end drawdown fund that would last six years. One of its investments was New York Community Bank which at the time was struggling and had received a $1 billion equity injection from a group of investors that included HBC.\n\n\n== Firm operations ==\nHBC manages the bulk of its assets in the multi-strategy fund but also invests in distressed debt and has engaged in shareholder activism. Struggling companies the firm has invested in include New York Community Bank, Plug Power and Transocean. It also provided a $155 million loan to  MCR Hotels, Three Wall Capital and Island Capital Group to refinance the Lexington Hotel .\nHBC has a risk framework called the \"The Deal Code System.\" which was mainly designed by Gerber. It is designed to be a scalable and repeatable portfolio management system that manages the returns and losses of the firm. HBC generally does not use much leverage or borrowed money nor does it perform risky trades.\n\n\n== Bed Bath & Beyond ==\nIn February 2023, HBC received attention from the media after it arranged a fundraising deal for Bed Bath & Beyond which at the time was on the verge of bankruptcy. The deal worth over $1 billion involved the sale of convertible preferred stock and warrants to HBC and other investors. The deal had large potential upside if the company recovered and limited downside for HBC as its exposure was hedged.\nOn March 30, 2023, Bed Bath & Beyond terminated its deal with HBC and instead tried to sell up to $300 million of common stock in the open market with the offering led by B. Riley Financial. Before the deal was terminated, Bed Bath & Beyond had raised at last $360 million where HBC had converted its preferred stock and warrants into at least 300 million new common shares and sold them on the open market by relying on retail investors. Bed Bath & Beyond and HBC amended the deal terms to preserve the deal even though the company stock had dropped below $1.00 which would have been a violation of the deal. However Bed Bath & Beyond stated it anticipated it would not be able to meet the conditions of the deal and terminated it. By April 2023, Bed Bath & Beyond had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nIn May 2024, Bed Bath & Beyond sued HBC to recover over $300 million in trading profits from their deal to pay off its creditors such as Sixth Street Partners. The lawsuit was filed under the short swing rule which was allegedly applicable to HBC as it was a shareholder that owned more than 10% of Bed Bath & Beyond's outstanding shares and therefore had to give any profits from short-term trading during a given six-month period to the company. The lawsuit alleged HBC orchestrated the terms of the deal so it could acquire a large stake in it at a deep discount without having to disclose the ownership. HBC aimed to make a quick profit by capitalizing on the company's popularity as a meme stock. In response, HBC stated Bed Bath & Beyond's creditors were behind the lawsuit and that it never owned more than 10% of its shares.  HBC had ended up with almost 98% of the common stock underlying the preferred shares and warrants issued in the deal. While HBC incorporated blockers to prevent it owning more than 9.99% of Bed Bath & Beyond, the lawsuit alleges the company never enforced them as it had no incentive to do so as it needed cash and also had no mechanism to enforce them. As a result, the purpose of the blockers were alleged to help HBC defendants sidestep the disclosure and disgorgement obligations of federal securities laws.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Call Down the Thunder is an album by the American musician Guy Davis, released in 1996. He supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nRecorded at The Loft, in Bronxville, New York, the album was coproduced by Joe Ferry. Davis considered his writing style similar to Bob Dylan's, where he would fill a page with as many words as possible before editing them. \"I Got the Power\" is about a deal with the devil. Pete Seeger played banjo on \"Jelly Bone Jelly\". \"Minglewood Blues\" is a version of the Noah Lewis song. \"When You Got a Good Friend\" is a cover of the Robert Johnson song. \"See Me When You Can\" is a tribute to Davis's grandmother.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Los Angeles Daily News opined that \"the best song here is barely blues at all... Davis's own 'The Road Is Calling' has a great r&b feel that fits so well.\" Jeanne Cooper, of The Boston Globe, listed Call Down the Thunder as the second best album of 1996. The Ithaca Journal said that Davis's \"gruff voice, spry fingerpicking and command of traditional acoustic blues styles add up to one powerful package.\" The Sydney Morning Herald concluded that \"the beautiful flourish of his performances and the genuine sincerity for his traditional musical culture are not the problem... Davis has yet to find his true voice.\"\nAllMusic wrote that Davis's \"slide playing is exceptional and at times very reminiscent of Robert Johnson.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Raid on Truskaw was a surprising attack on the battalion stationed in the village of Truskaw by the Kaminski Brigade, carried out on the night of 2/3 September 1944 by a detachment from the Kampinos Group led by Lieutenant Adolf Pilch, codenamed Dolina.\nOn 27 August 1944, the vicinity of Truskaw and Sieraków was occupied by units of the collaborating Kaminski Brigade, thus preventing communication between Home Army units in the Kampinos Forest and the insurgent Warsaw. The enemy soon began to attack the Polish outpost in nearby Pociecha. In this situation, commanding the \"Palmiry-Młociny\" Regiment, Lieutenant Dolina organized a night raid on the Kaminski troops stationed in Truskaw. With minimal losses of their own, the Poles completely defeated two enemy subunits, capturing large quantities of weapons and ammunition in the process. This success – combined with a successful raid on Marianów the following night – forced the Kaminski Brigade to retreat from the southern outskirts of the Kampinos Forest.\n\n\n== \"Independent Republic of Kampinos\" ==\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising, fighting also spread to the northwest of the capital, in the Kampinos Forest. At that time, the structures of the Home Army from the pre-war gminas of Czosnów and Młociny, as well as from the eastern part of the Gmina Zaborów, were part of the VIII District Łęgi of the Warsaw County Subdistrict of the Warsaw District. This district was commanded by Captain Józef Krzyczkowski, codenamed Szymon. On the eve of the uprising, the Home Army units under his command could deploy two infantry battalions with the strength of five first-line companies. However, the weakness of these units lay in their armament. Captain Szymon estimated in his post-war memoirs that after the mobilization in July 1944, his district could muster only from 350 to 400 armed soldiers for combat. Fortunately for the Polish side, the balance of power in the Kampinos Forest changed dramatically at the end of July 1944 when the Stowbtsy-Naliboki Group arrived in Dziekanów Polski from the Naliboki forest in the Eastern Borderlands. It consisted of 861 well-armed soldiers, led by Lieutenant Adolf Pilch, codenamed Góra or Dolina – a Silent Unseen paratrooper, an experienced partisan who had been fighting against the Germans and Soviet partisans since autumn 1943. Initially, the Polish Underground State received Dolina and his soldiers with great mistrust due to accusations of collaboration with the Germans. However, the Home Army High Command eventually agreed to incorporate the Naliboki group into the VIII District.\nOn 3 August 1944, based on the units of the VIII District and the Stowbtsy-Naliboki Group, the Palmiry-Młociny Regiment was formed, commanded by Lieutenant Dolina. After the outbreak of the uprising in the Kampinos Forest, small Home Army units from various districts of Warsaw also appeared, leaving the city after the failure of the initial Polish attacks during \"W\" Hour. Gradually, units from other regions and districts of the Warsaw District, as well as from the neighboring Western Sub-District of the Warsaw Area of the Home Army, also arrived there. Based on these units, a partisan formation called the Kampinos Group was created. At its peak, it numbered about 2,700 soldiers and 700 horses.\nThe actions of the Kampinos Group did not change the fate of the uprising. After unsuccessful attacks on the Bielany airport (from 1 to 2 August 1944), Polish units had to temporarily withdraw deeper into the Kampinos Forest. Meanwhile, the Home Army command, which had high hopes for the presence of a strong partisan group in the immediate vicinity of Warsaw, directed Major Alfons Kotowski, codenamed Okoń, to the forest, instructing him to organize relief for the capital and then carry out vigorous offensive actions towards Powązki. Okoń reached the Kampinos Group on the night of August 15/16. However, before this happened, there was chaos in the command of the forest units, which would profoundly affect the actions of the Polish group. Due to mutual disagreements and indecision among Home Army commanders, it was not possible to organize an attack on the rear of the German Battle Group Reinefarth. Ultimately, nearly 1,000 soldiers of the Kampinos Group crossed into Żoliborz, where they were intended to be used to break through the German barrier separating this district from the Old Town. However, two night attacks on the heavily fortified Warszawa Gdańska Station ended in defeat and the loss of nearly 500 soldiers (August 20/21 and August 21/22). After the failed assaults, some of the \"forest\" soldiers returned with Major Okoń to the Kampinos Forest, while others remained in Żoliborz. Along with the soldiers of the Kampinos Group, a certain number of insurgents, including primarily the 100-strong company of the Special Insurgent Units Jerzyki under the command of Lieutenant Jerzy Strzałkowski, codenamed Jerzy, left the city.\nUpon returning from Warsaw, Major Okoń brought with him an order signed by General Tadeusz Pełczyński, codenamed Robak, confirming that Okoń was in charge of all Home Army units in the Kampinos Forest. In the same order, the Chief of Staff of the Home Army Headquarters also assigned new tasks to the Kampinos Group. Essentially, they had a passive character and did not involve conducting major diversionary actions behind the German lines fighting in Warsaw. According to General Pełczyński's order, the tasks of the forest units were to:\n\norganize a supply base for insurgent Warsaw;\norganize deliveries of weapons, ammunition, food, and equipment to the fighting capital;\nexpand the drop-off reception base, used to receive weapon drops and supplies made by Allied aviation;\nexpand the radio center to ensure continuity of operation;\ncooperate with Home Army units fighting in Warsaw to eliminate German units in the northwestern part of the city;\norganize standby units to ensure protection of the drop-off reception base.\nAt that time, the Kampinos Group already firmly controlled the central and eastern areas of the Kampinos Forest, encompassing the villages of Ławy, Łubiec, Roztoka, Kiścinne, Krogulec, Wędziszew, Brzozówka, Truskawka, Janówek, Pociecha, Zaborów Leśny, and Wiersze. The headquarters of the formation was located in the latter village. Polish patrols were also able to penetrate numerous neighboring towns previously unoccupied by the enemy. The area controlled by the Home Army soldiers was called the \"Independent Republic of Kampinos\".\n\n\n== Arrival of the Kaminski Brigade in the Kampinos Forest ==\n\nThe task of separating Warsaw from the Kampinos Forest was initially entrusted by the German command to their Hungarian allies, specifically to the 12th Reserve Division of the II Reserve Corps. However, the Germans quickly realized that the cordoned zone created by their allies remained largely fictional, as the Honvéd troops openly sympathized with the Poles. Although the Hungarian command rejected the Polish proposal to change sides, both parties entered into an informal \"non-aggression pact\". The Hungarians did not interfere with maintaining communication between the forest units and Żoliborz, even allowing on several occasions the passage of compact and well-armed Home Army units near their outposts. In this situation, at the end of August, the Germans withdrew the Hungarians from the vicinity of Warsaw, while simultaneously strengthening the cordon around the city. The Kampinos Group quickly felt these changes. On the night of August 26/27, or in the early morning of August 27, a unit of Jerzyk soldiers heading towards Żoliborz with a transport of weapons, ammunition, and food was warned by the chaplain of the hospital in Laski, Father Professor Stefan Wyszyński, codenamed Radwan III, that the road to Warsaw via Truskaw, Laski, and Izabelin was blocked by strong enemy positions. Moreover, the Germans were reportedly well-informed about the approaching Polish unit. When hastily dispatched patrols confirmed the validity of the warning, Lieutenant Jerzy withdrew his unit back to the forest.\n\nOn August 27, in the afternoon, a detached regiment from the Kaminski Brigade arrived in Truskaw and Sieraków, numbering nearly 1,500 soldiers. Kaminski Brigade was a collaborationist formation, composed mainly of Russians and Belarusians. It was led by SS-Brigadeführer Bronislav Kaminski. From August 4, the Kaminski Brigade had been fighting in the Warsaw district of Ochota, and then in the southern part of the city center. However, the first clashes with the insurgents showed that Kaminski's unit had minimal combat value, and its soldiers were interested only in looting, alcohol, and women. During the battles in Ochota, the Kaminski Brigade soldiers committed many cruel crimes against the Polish civilian population. Their victims even included German women serving in Wehrmacht auxiliary formations. Furthermore, Kaminski, citing alleged authorizations obtained directly from Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, openly displayed insubordination to German generals. In this situation, the German command concluded that the further presence of Kaminski Brigade in Warsaw could bring more harm than benefit. Probably on August 19, Kaminski was relieved of command, and a week later he was summoned to Łódź, where he stood trial before a German drumhead court-martial, which sentenced him to death. The sentence was probably carried out on the night of August 28/29. The soldiers of the Kaminski Brigade were informed that Kaminski was killed by Polish partisans.\nMeanwhile, on August 23, the Kaminski Brigade was transferred from the southern part of the city center to Muranów, from where it was redeployed to the Kampinos Forest after a few days, occupying the positions vacated by the Hungarian troops, who were not trusted by the Germans. Kaminski Brigade quickly established a solid line of defense stretching through Laski, Izabelin, and Borzęcin towards Leszno. Similar to what had happened earlier in Warsaw, the Kaminski Brigade brutally terrorized the Polish civilian population. For the inhabitants of Kampinos villages, robberies and rapes became a daily occurrence. Individuals who resisted or angered the soldiers were often murdered on the spot. The first skirmishes between the Kaminski Brigade and the soldiers of the Kampinos Group occurred on August 28. That day, in the morning, a patrol from the Jerzyk company went to Truskaw, where it engaged in a fight with a strong Kaminski Brigade unit. In the clash, three Home Army soldiers were killed or mortally wounded, while the enemy losses were estimated at two killed and eight wounded. Later, in the evening, Kaminski Brigade conducted a reconnaissance by combat in the vicinity of the hamlet of Pociecha. Home Army soldiers repelled the attack, killing or injuring several Kaminski Brigade soldiers.\n\n\n== Fighting at Pociecha ==\n\nPociecha became the target of numerous enemy attacks in the following days. This was because the roads from Sieraków and Truskaw, through which the Germans and their collaborators could penetrate deep into the forest controlled by the partisans, converged there. The potential loss of the hamlet would also mean pushing the Home Army units away from strategically important roads like Warsaw–Modlin and Warsaw–Leszno, and ultimately isolating the \"Republic of Kampinos\" from insurgent Warsaw. Furthermore, the presence of a Polish outpost in Pociecha prevented the Germans from using a convenient forest trail leading from Warsaw through Palmiry to Kazuń and Modlin.\nThe defense of Pociecha was initially entrusted to the Jerzyk company by the command of the Kampinos Group. However, on August 28, the infantry was reinforced with the 3rd squadron of the 27th Uhlan Regiment, commanded by Sub-Lieutenant Narcyz Kulikowski, codenamed Sum. This increased the number of defenders to about 200 soldiers. Over the next few days, significant Kaminski Brigade forces concentrated in the Pociecha area, estimated by the authors of the actions of Działania powstańcze VIII Rejonu to comprise two infantry battalions supported by two howitzers, two 75mm guns, and ten mortars.\nOn August 29, the Kaminski Brigade resumed attacks on Pociecha. In the Jerzyk platoon defending the crucial position on the extensive dune near the hamlet, the artillery fire and the commander's injury caused a momentary panic. However, with the support of the Uhlans, the position was ultimately held, and the Kaminski Brigade were repelled, suffering heavy losses (Józef Krzyczkowski reported that these events took place on August 31). The enemy attacks on other sectors also failed.\nFrom 30 to 31 August, the intensity of the fighting did not diminish. Polish positions were under heavy artillery and machine gun fire, and the Kaminski Brigade made periodic attempts to break through the Polish defense. German fighter planes also intervened twice. At noon on August 31, the Polish command replaced the Jerzyk company with Lieutenant Mazur's company from Major Korwin's Sochaczew Battalion. While taking over the frontline positions, the Sochaczew soldiers came under heavy artillery fire and left their defended position in disarray. However, a counterattack by the Jerzyk soldiers, who were brought back, allowed the situation to be regained, and by the end of the day, the soldiers of the Sochaczew Battalion were able to hold their positions independently (Józef Krzyczkowski reported that these events took place on September 2). In the evening of the same day, the 3rd squadron was also relieved, and their positions were taken over by the Uhlans from the 2nd squadron commanded by Senior Warrant Officer Józef Niedźwiecki, codenamed Lawina (Sum's squadron returned to the Pociecha area two days later).\nFrom 1 to 2 September, the Polish positions in the Pociecha area were still under intense artillery fire from the enemy. Kaminski Brigade also continued its attempts to break through the Polish defense. Józef Krzyczkowski stated that for two days, the Russians launched somewhat hesitant attacks, each time being halted under the fire of Polish machine guns and mortars. The Kaminski Brigade command did not attempt to outflank the Polish positions but stubbornly sent its units into frontal attacks. Meanwhile, fatigue caused by constant enemy artillery fire was increasingly felt in the Polish units. Adam Borkiewicz, on the other hand, claimed that the Kaminski Brigade's offensive actions reached their peak on September 2 when, during hours-long fighting, Home Army soldiers repelled as many as seven enemy attacks.\nAccording to Marian Podgóreczny's assessment, the six-day trench warfare in the Pociecha area was the longest partisan battle fought on Polish soil during the German occupation. Józef Krzyczkowski claimed that 16 Polish soldiers were killed and 23 were wounded in the defense of the village. The losses suffered by the Kaminski Brigade were estimated by him to be at least 30 killed and 40 wounded. Jerzy Koszada provided slightly different numbers. According to him, Polish units lost 21 killed and 35 wounded, while Kaminski Brigade's losses were 51 killed and 40 wounded.\n\n\n== Night attack on Truskaw ==\n\n\n=== Preparations ===\n\nThe course of the battles in the Pociecha area indicated that the Kampinos Group should not passively await further attacks by the Kaminski Brigade forces. It was necessary to anticipate the possibility of stronger enemy pressure, with the outcome of the next confrontation being unpredictable if the Germans reinforced the Kaminski Brigade with armored vehicles and additional artillery batteries. The Home Army intelligence reported the constant reinforcement of enemy forces in Truskaw and Sieraków, as well as the gathering of new units in Laski, Izabelin, and Hornówek. Meanwhile, the Kaminski Brigade artillery deployed in Truskaw and Sieraków was severely affecting the defenders of Pociecha. Polish soldiers had to spend hours entrenched under enemy fire, with casualties in killed and wounded every day. Polish outposts in Wiersze, Truskawka, Krogulec, and Kiscinne also fell within the range of enemy artillery. The Kampinos Group, lacking its own artillery, could not effectively respond to enemy fire. It was also impossible to neutralize the enemy artillery through forays into the open field, as the Kaminski Brigade batteries remained safely concealed behind their forward positions. The fact that the local population demanded a reaction from the Home Army soldiers to the crimes committed by the Kaminski Brigade was also not insignificant.\nA frontal attack on well-fortified positions of a heavily armed enemy did not promise greater chances of success and also posed serious risks of casualties. In this situation, Lieutenant Dolina proposed to Major Okoń on September 1st to conduct a deep raid on the enemy's rear. The aim of this risky action was to break up the Kaminski Brigade battalion quartered in Truskaw. Despite initial hesitations, the group's commander agreed. It was decided that the raid on Truskaw would take place on the night of September 2nd to 3rd. Additionally, Okoń decided that on the same night, he would personally lead a similar raid on the Kaminski Brigade unit in neighboring Sieraków.\nDue to the nature of the task, Dolina decided to carry out the raid with a small but well-armed unit consisting exclusively of carefully selected volunteers. Approximately 600 soldiers volunteered for the operation, of which the lieutenant selected 80 (including 70 soldiers from frontline units and 10 from rear formations). All soldiers were armed with submachine guns and grenades, and several light machine guns and PIAT weapons were also taken. Okoń's unit was similarly armed, mainly composed of Uhlans from the 3rd squadron (its numbers were estimated by Adam Borkiewicz at about 100 soldiers). The plan envisaged that Dolina's unit would conduct a deep flanking maneuver around Truskaw from the west and south, followed by a surprise attack on the enemy's rear. The task was risky, as the soldiers had to pass through open fields unnoticed, avoiding enemy outposts along the way. A similar plan was devised to break up the Kaminski Brigade unit in Sieraków, although Okoń's task was somewhat easier as it could be circumvented more easily through the cover of the forest and overgrown meadows.\n\n\n=== Course of the raid ===\n\nIn the summer of 1944, the buildings of Truskaw were scattered over an area of ​​nearly two kilometers and stretched from the Izabelin groves to the marshy meadows, which separated the village from the Kampinos Forest. A wide road ran through the village. Near the center of Truskaw, roads leading to Pociecha and Mariew converged, creating the equivalent of a large square. It was precisely at this location that the enemy camp was located, while the artillery positions lay a little further northeast. The enemy forces quartered in Truskaw were estimated to consist of an infantry battalion and an artillery battery – together about 500 soldiers. Valuable information about the enemy's strength and the location of their positions was provided to Dolina by the scout Józef Zych, codenamed Sosna, who infiltrated the village before the strike force set out on the mission.\nThe departure from Wiersze took place on September 2 at 7:00 PM. Not wanting to unnecessarily fatigue the soldiers before the battle, Dolina decided that the unit would be transported to the starting positions by wagons. The journey through sandy forest paths took about two hours. Upon reaching the forward positions in Zaborowo Leśne, the soldiers left the wagons and continued on foot. Dolina informed Lieutenant Jerzy and Sergeant Narcyz about the planned action, instructing them to wait ready and come to the aid of the strike force if necessary. Fearing that the soldiers might get lost in the darkness, or worse, stumble upon enemy outposts by chance, Dolina ordered them to march in pairs in close formation. However, that night the moon was bright, and only the lingering fog covered the unit's march. The soldiers, marching along the edge of the forest, reached the open space, then traversed a canal running through the fields to enter the forest called Dębina. Along the way, they managed to stealthily bypass enemy outposts. After a brief rest in Dębina, the unit unnoticedly made its way to the sandy dunes stretching along the Szałasy grove, where Dolina ordered another short rest. Finally, after nearly two and a half hours of approach, the Polish soldiers reached the southeastern outskirts of Truskaw.\nDolina then divided his unit into three groups. On the left flank was a team led by Lieutenant Lech Zabierek, codenamed Wulkan. In the center, a team led by Lieutenant Aleksander Wolski, codenamed Jastrząb, moved, responsible for securing the rear. The right flank was occupied by a detachment led by Lieutenant Tadeusz Gaworski, codenamed Lawa, accompanied by Dolina himself. It was decided that the password for the night battle would be the call sobota! (English: Saturday!). The Polish soldiers entered Truskaw at around midnight. The village was deserted as most of the residents had fled earlier for fear of the Kaminski Brigade. However, in one of the farms, the soldiers found an old peasant who informed them that the enemy unit was quartered in the farm buildings at the other end of the village, closest to the Kampinos Forest. The old man also warned that another Kaminski Brigade battalion had arrived in the village that night, equipped with at least several cannons. This fact meant that the already apparent numerical disparity of forces had increased even more. After a brief consideration, Dolina decided, however, to attack according to the plan, hoping that the element of surprise would neutralize the enemy's numerical advantage.\nIt was probably around 1:00 AM when Dolina's soldiers began their attack. The surprise to the enemy was complete. Polish soldiers later described the course of the battle as a \"slaughter\". Many Kaminski Brigade soldiers were killed in their sleep, while the remaining, completely surprised and often stunned by alcohol, were unable to mount organized resistance against the Poles. In this action, Home Army soldiers did not take prisoners. Soon, a significant part of the village was set on fire. Many Kaminski Brigade soldiers burned in the ignited barns. Polish soldiers only briefly ceased fire to allow women held captive by the Kaminski Brigade to escape from the burning buildings. In the darkness of the night, the fighting took place at close quarters, and only the agreed password sobota allowed the Polish soldiers to distinguish friends from foes. Some of the enemy soldiers, having recovered from the initial surprise, opened fire with grenades and machine guns, but amidst the chaos, this fire struck their comrades more than the Polish partisans. The few remaining enemy resistance nests were eliminated by Dolina's soldiers using grenades or PIATs. Among other things, grenades were used to clear out the command post of the Kaminski Brigade battalion, which had taken refuge in the basement of one of the houses. Soon, the surviving Russians began a panicked retreat. Those fleeing towards the village of Ławy were hunted down by Wulkan's soldiers, while Lawa's detachment eliminated the enemies trying to occupy backup positions on the eastern outskirts of the village. Incidents occurred where wounded Kaminski Brigade soldiers were finished off by local peasants, seeking revenge for earlier murders, rapes, and looting.\nThe first to reach the enemy battery was a team led by Sergeant Aleksander Bibik, codenamed Zaręba, from Lieutenant Jastrząb's group. The gun crew was quickly wiped out. Polish soldiers did not have means of transportation to evacuate the captured guns, so most of them were rendered unusable. The guns were destroyed by throwing grenades into the barrels or placing artillery shells wrapped in bundles of straw under their carriages, which were then set on fire. Dozens of wagons from the enemy camp also went up in flames. The fight was already dying down when the crates of ammunition on the wagons began to explode, momentarily mistaken for the sound of German reinforcements for the Kaminski Brigade. Around 4:00 AM, Dolina's unit began to withdraw towards Zaborów Leśny. The enemy units stationed in nearby villages remained passive. Sergeant Zaręba managed to take out one captured gun from the burning Truskaw, while Lawa's soldiers took a wagon with artillery ammunition with them.\nHowever, the raid on Sieraków carried out on the same night turned out to be unsuccessful. When Major Okoń's unit reached the village, it turned out that the enemy had left it the day before. Moreover, the Kaminski Brigade unit that left Sieraków was the same unit that was quartered in Truskaw that night and was defeated there by Dolina's soldiers. Józef Krzyczkowski believed that the failure of the raid on Sieraków was due to neglecting earlier reconnaissance of the enemy's positions. Major Okoń's excessive bravado was also criticized, as contrary to Sergeant Narcyz's suggestions, he struck Sieraków frontally, which in case of encountering enemy resistance could have ended in failure and heavy losses.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe risky raid on Truskaw was crowned with complete success. The small unit led by Dolina managed to completely break two strong Kaminski Brigade subunits and eliminate the artillery position that had been troubling the defenders of Pociecha. The losses suffered by the Kaminski Brigade that night can only be estimated approximately. Józef Krzyczkowski and Adolf Pilch, relying on information obtained from the local population, estimated that around 250 Kaminski Brigade soldiers were killed during the night battle, with another 100 wounded. Tadeusz Łaszkiewicz, based on information from the partisan cavalry reconnaissance, estimated the enemy's losses at around 130 killed. Adam Borkiewicz and Tomasz Zatwarnicki, on the other hand, assessed that the Kaminski Brigade lost 91 killed in this engagement. Dolina's soldiers captured a 75 mm caliber gun with an ammunition wagon, two heavy mortars, 1 medium machine gun, 13 light machine guns, several dozen submachine guns, a field radio station with batteries, and large quantities of ammunition and grenades. Numerous watches and valuables looted previously in Warsaw were found near the bodies of the fallen Kaminski Brigade soldiers. Additionally, the Poles destroyed several to a dozen artillery pieces (including one 105 mm caliber), as well as 60 rifles and nearly 30 ammunition wagons.\nPolish losses amounted to 10 killed and 10 wounded. Among the fallen were: Lieutenant Marcin Taszkan codenamed Tur, Corporal Jan Szostak codenamed Fab, Corporal Jan Łukaszewicz codenamed Januszek, Senior Rifleman Jan Kazimierz Jarkowski codenamed Sewer, Senior Lancer Karol Piesiewicz, Senior Rifleman Kazimierz Szczerbiński, Rifleman Jerzy Woźniak codenamed Brązowy, and Rifleman Jerzy Zawadzki codenamed Kri.\nOne of the Kaminski Brigade soldiers killed in Truskaw was Rifleman Ivan Ivanovich Vaschenko from the village of Kociewicze in the Vitebsk Region. His personal diary was found next to his body, which was later translated into Polish on Captain Szymon's orders. After the war, Ivan Vaschenko's diary became a valuable source of information for Polish historians about the Kaminski Brigade and its participation in the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising.\nThe Polish command decided to convince the enemy that the Kampinos Group had embarked on large-scale offensive actions. Therefore, on the night of September 3/4, another raid was carried out – this time aimed at the village of Marianów near Leszno, where a strong garrison consisting of Germans and Kaminski Brigade troops was quartered. The combined unit under the command of Captain Zdzisław Nurkiewicz codenamed Nieczaj and Lieutenant Zygmunt Koc codenamed Dąbrowa, consisting of 80 lancers from the 2nd and 4th squadrons, made a deep flanking maneuver around the enemy positions, then struck Marianów from the south. As a result of the half-hour battle, the enemy unit was completely shattered, losing between 60 and 100 killed. Between 22 and 24 Kaminski Brigade soldiers were captured. They were executed when objects and valuables looted in Warsaw were found in their possession. The lancers captured 2 light machine guns, 7 submachine guns, several horses with saddles, and dozens of rifles. Polish losses were limited to one killed and five wounded.\nOn September 4, Kaminski Brigade subunits withdrew to the Laski–Izabelin–Hornówek–Lipków line, setting fire to half of Truskaw's buildings and almost the entire Sieraków beforehand. The Kaminski Brigade soldiers did not dare to conduct any more offensive actions against the Kampinos Group, limiting themselves to terrorizing the residents of the surrounding villages. On September 15, the remnants of the regiment were loaded onto transport in Błonie and sent to the Racibórz area, where the rest of the Kaminski Brigade forces were stationed. The entire brigade was later incorporated into the Russian 29th SS Grenadier Division, being organized in Germany.\n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nIn Truskaw, at the crossroads of roads leading from Izabelin and Borzęcin to Pociecha, a commemorative rock and plaque were unveiled in August 1971, dedicated to the soldiers of the Polish Army and the Home Army, as well as the residents of Truskaw and the surrounding villages who fell and were murdered during World War II. In September 2002, another plaque commemorating the victorious raid of the Dolina unit was unveiled at the monument.\nIn Pociecha, on a small hill surrounded by a wall, there is also a monument commemorating the soldiers of the Jerzyki company who fell in defense of the village from August 28 to September 2, 1944. The monument consists of a stylized cross and a plaque set at an angle.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBartelski, Lesław Marian (2002). \"Obroża\".

Its best finish in the competition was 13th (out of 22) in the first division in 1961–62.  In the FA Cup it never got beyond the second qualifying round.\nIn 1960, the club was ambitious enough to sign Wilf Mannion as player-manager, spending £3,000 on buying him a house in the town.  Shortly after his dismissal in 1962, the club withdrew from the Combination.  The club's last recorded match was a 10–0 defeat at Altrincham in the first qualifying round of the 1963–64 FA Cup, Taberner scoring a double hat-trick and Wilson in goal being credited with keeping the score down to a mere ten.  Mannion sued the club committee for breach of contract and in 1965 settled for £75 plus £50 costs.\n\n\n== Colours ==\nThe club played in tangerine shirts and white shorts.\n\n\n== Ground ==\nThe club played at Vista Park.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "You Are Here is a 2024 romance novel by British writer David Nicholls. The novel centers on two middle-aged protagonists, who unexpectedly find themselves together on a long-distance walking trail across northern England after being brought together by a mutual friend.\nThe novel explores themes surrounding modern love, loneliness, second chances, and the search for human connection, continuing Nicholls' exploration of romantic relationships across different life stages that he pursued in previous works like One Day, Us, and Sweet Sorrow. It received positive reviews from critics,  who praised Nicholls's writing style, characterization, and ability to capture the complexities of modern love and loneliness.\n\n\n== Background ==\nNicholls considers You Are Here \"the best thing I've written\", \"a love story in a classic style, a chamber piece that happens to take place on an epic journey from the west to east coast\". The novel continues Nicholls' exploration of themes surrounding love and relationships that he has pursued across his work, including his successful third novel One Day. Nicholls described his novels as covering \"love and the experience of love, and what it's to like fall in and out of love between the ages of 16 and 58\" – with protagonists ranging from Douglas at 58 at the end of his fourth novel Us, to Charlie at 16 at the start of his fifth novel Sweet Sorrow. With You Are Here, Nicholls said \"I wanted to write about the bit in the middle.\"\nNicholls revealed that You Are Here arose indirectly from the experience of the COVID-19 lockdowns, and a self-conscious re-engagement with social interaction afterwards, saying \"I wanted to write a love story about loneliness... A little bit wary and nervous about the whole business of human interaction, as if it was a skill that I'd forgotten.\"\nNicholls indicated there have been discussions about adapting You Are Here for the screen, though he could not provide any specific details. He noted some of the challenges in translating the novel's internal perspectives and atmospheric English weather to a visual medium.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe novel is written in alternating perspectives from two middle-aged, divorced and lonely characters – Marnie Walsh, a 38-year-old copy editor from London, and Michael Bradshaw, a 42-year-old geography teacher from York. Their mutual friend Cleo organizes a group to go on a long-distance walking trip across northern England, inviting both Marnie and Michael in hopes it will help them engage with the world again after their marriages failed.\nAt first, Marnie is interested in another member of the group, Conrad, but he soon drops out along with the others. This leaves just Marnie and Michael to continue the walk together, starting from the Irish Sea and making their way across the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, and the North York Moors. Though Marnie had planned to participate for only the first few days, she keeps extending her time on the trail to spend more time with Michael.\nOver the course of their journey, Marnie and Michael develop romantic feelings for each other and they kiss, though they stop short of being intimate when a hotel worker enforces the \"no guests after 10pm\" policy. Just as Marnie is considering staying for the final leg, she discovers that Michael is meeting with his estranged wife Natasha, to whom he admits he is still attached. Heartbroken, Marnie returns home to London, while Natasha is revealed to be pregnant by her new partner.\nMonths later, Michael arranges a school trip to London where he and Marnie reunite in Hyde Park. He apologizes, professes his feelings for her, and invites her to complete the unfinished coast-to-coast walk with him. They kiss, and Marnie agrees to consider his proposal.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nYou Are Here explores themes of love, loneliness, and second chances in middle age. The novel deals with the complexities of modern love and the challenges of finding connection in an increasingly isolated world. Nicholls delves into the lives of two characters who have been bruised by past relationships and are struggling to re-engage with the world around them, examining the ways in which people can become trapped in their own solitude and the courage it takes to break free from those patterns. The novel also touches on the theme of redemption, as the protagonists, Marnie and Michael, embark on a journey of self-discovery and personal growth.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nYou Are Here received positive reviews from critics. The novel was described as \"a well-mapped romance\" by Lucy Atkins in The Guardian, who appreciated Nicholls's talent for making \"unpromising characters appealing\" and his \"extraordinary ability to capture the absurdity of modern life in pithy textural details\". Alex Preston, also writing for The Guardian, called the novel \"a great comic novel\" and \"superb on the landscape\", praising Nicholls's ability to make the reader invest in the \"unspectacular, everyday, cagoule-clad romance\".\nHowever, Claire Allfree of The Telegraph gave the novel a more critical review, describing it as \"far too contrived to be satisfying\" and suggesting that Nicholls was \"much too firmly in his [comfort zone]\". Adrienne Wyper of The Week praised the novel's \"witty conversation, weather, overnight stops, mild drunken escapades and tugged heartstrings\", but noted that it generally \"move[d] along with an air of inevitability\".\nJohanna Thomas-Corr of The Times described You Are Here as \"One Day for midlife romantics\", praising Nicholls's ability to find the \"sweet spot between pathos and bathos\" and his \"exquisite descriptions of longing\". Erica Wagner of the Financial Times called Nicholls \"a master of his particular craft\", describing the novel as one that \"will make you feel terrific\".\nAllan Massie of The Scotsman described You Are Here as \"an intelligent, sympathetic, amusing and humane novel\", praising its \"ordinariness\" and Nicholls's ability to write \"of recognizable people and his characters are all individuals rather than types\". Neil Armstrong of the BBC noted that the novel \"contains all the elements that have become [Nicholls's] trademark: comedy, piercing social observation, more cultural references than Taylor Swift and, of course, romance\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Guglielmo Pepe was an Italian Alessandro Poerio-class scout cruiser. Commissioned into service in the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in 1915, she served during World War I, participating in the Adriatic campaign, often supporting raids by Italian motor torpedo boats. She was reclassified as a destroyer in 1921 due to her light displacement. Like her sister ships, Alessandro Poerio and Cesare Rossarol, she was named after a famous Neapolitan light cavalryman who helped defend Venice from attacks by the Imperial Austrian Army during the revolutions in 1848.\nIn 1937, Fascist Italy sold the ship to the Nationalist faction in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Renamed Teruel, the ship subsequently served in the Spanish Navy until she was stricken in 1948.\n\n\n== Design ==\nGuglielmo Pepe was an Italian \"light scout cruiser\" (Italian:esploratore leggero) measuring 85 m (278 ft 10 in) long and 8 m (26 ft 3 in) in beam. She had three Yarrow three-drum water-tube boilers with water pipes, two groups of Belluzzo steam turbines rated at 24,000 hp (17,897 kW), and two three-blade propellers. Her fuel capacity of 325 tons gave her a range of 2,400 nautical miles (4,400 km; 2,800 mi) at 13 knots (24 km/h; 15 mph). She could launch torpedoes while maintaining a constant speed of over 30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph). Her normal displacement was 891 tons standard, and her full-load displacement was 1,270 tons.\nPlans originally called for Guglielmo Pepe to have an armament of four 102/35 mm guns and eight 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes, but was revised during construction, and she entered service with six 102/35-millimetre guns and four 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes, and a minelaying capacity of 42 mines, making her armament equivalent to that of an Austro-Hungarian Novara-class scout cruiser. In 1916, two 76/40 mm Mod 16 RM guns were installed aboard her; they were removed in 1917 when two 40/39 mm guns replaced them. In 1918, she was refitted with 102/45 mm guns.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nGuglielmo Pepe was laid down by Gio. Ansaldo & C. at Sestri Ponente, Italy, on 2 July 1913. She was launched on 17 September 1914 and commissioned on 20 August 1915.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Regia Marina ===\n\n\n==== World War I ====\n\n\n===== 1915–1916 =====\nWorld War I was raging when Guglielmo Pepe entered service in August 1915. On 30 December 1915 she became part of the 2nd Scouting Group of the 4th Naval Division along with her sister ships Alessandro Poerio and Cesare Rossarol, based at Venice.\nOn 3 May 1916, Guglielmo Pepe and Cesare Rossarol got underway with the destroyers Francesco Nullo and Giuseppe Missori to provide distant support to the destroyers Fuciliere and Zeffiro as they laid a minefield in the Adriatic Sea off Šibenik (known to the Italians as Sebenico) on the coast of Austria-Hungary. Off Punta Maestra, the Italian formation sighted four Austro-Hungarian Navy Huszár-class destroyers and six Austro-Hungarian torpedo boats and steered to attack them. While the Austro-Hungarian ships headed toward the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola with the Italians in pursuit, three Austro-Hungarian seaplanes attacked the Italian ships. The Italians repelled the attack, but at 15:50, after an Austro-Hungarian cruiser and two additional Austro-Hungarian torpedo boats departed Pola to support the Austro-Hungarian ships, the Italian force gave up the chase and withdrew. Meanwhile, Fuciliere and Zeffiro succeeded in laying the minefield during the night of 3–4 May 1916.\nGuglielmo Pepe and Cesare Rossarol laid a minefield off Ancona, Italy, on 11 May 1916.\nEscorted as far as the Austro-Hungarian defensive barrage by Guglielmo Pepe and Cesare Rossarol and supported by the destroyers Alpino and Fuciliere and the coastal torpedo boats 40 PN and 46 OS, the destroyer Zeffiro, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate captain) Costanzo Ciano and with Lieutenant Nazario Sauro, an Italian irredentist, aboard as pilot, entered the port of Poreč on the western side of Istria, a peninsula on Austria-Hungary's coast, at dawn on 12 June 1916. A group of men from Zeffiro, including Sauro, captured a gendarme who showed them the location of an aircraft hangar. In the meantime, Alpino, Fuciliere, 40 PN, and 46 OS had joined Zeffiro, and at 04:50 they began a bombardment which lasted about 20 minutes. The hangar suffered damage from hits by 76-millimetre (3 in) shells from the Italian ships. Austro-Hungarian coastal artillery batteries returned fire,  and then 10 Austro-Hungarian seaplanes attacked the Italian ships. Allied aircraft came to the defense of the Italians, resulting in a dogfight in which Austro-Hungarian seaplanes collided with two Italian and one French aircraft. All the Italian ships returned to base, although they suffered damage and a number of casualties, including four men killed in action.\nOn 1–2 November 1916, Guglielmo Pepe, Alessandro Poerio, Francesco Nullo, and Giuseppe Missori made ready to provide possible support to an incursion by MAS motor torpedo boats into the Fasana Channel on the southwest coast of Istria.\n\n\n===== 1917–1918 =====\nOn the night of 25–26 August 1917 Guglielmo Pepe and Cesare Rossarol escorted the coastal torpedo boats 34 PN, with the  motor torpedo boat MAS 6 in tow, and 35 PN, towing the motor torpedo boat MAS 91, to a point where the two MAS boats dropped their towlines The MAS boats then raided the harbor at Durrës (known to the Italians as Durazzo) on the coast of the Principality of Albania in an attempt to attack steamers there. The MAS boats found no steamers in the harbor and withdrew without results.\nAn Austro-Hungarian Navy force consisting of the scout cruiser Helgoland and the destroyers Balaton, Csepel, Lika, Orjen, Tatra, and Triglav left Cattaro on 18 October 1917 to attack Italian convoys. The Austro-Hungarians found no convoys, so Helgoland and Lika moved to within sight of Brindisi to entice Italian ships into chasing them and lure the Italians into an ambush by the Austro-Hungarian submarines U-32 and U-40. At 06:30 on 19 October 1917, Guglielmo Pepe, with Contrammiraglio (Counter admiral) Biscaretti embarked, got underway from Brindisi with Alessandro Poerio and the destroyers Pilade Bronzetti, Insidioso and Simone Schiaffino  to pursue the Austro-Hungarians. The destroyers Ippolito Nievo and Rosolino Pilo and the British light cruiser HMS Weymouth diverted from a voyage from Vlorë (known to the Italians as Valona), Albania, to Brindisi to join the pursuit. After a long chase which also saw some Italian air attacks on the Austro-Hungarian ships, the Austro-Hungarians escaped and all the Italian ships returned to port without damage.\nGuglielmo Pepe, Cesare Rossarol, Ippolito Nievo, and the destroyer Indomito were assigned to support a raid against Durrës on the night of 10–11 February 1918 by the motor torpedo boats MAS 9 and MAS 20, towed by the coastal torpedo boats 37 PN and 38 PN. Bad weather forced the cancellation of the raid.\nAt 23:54 on 14 May 1918, Ippolito Nievo, with MAS 99 in tow, and Pilade Bronzetti, towing MAS 100, dropped their tow cables about 15 nautical miles (28 km; 17 mi) from Bar (known to the Italians as Antivari) on the coast of Montenegro. The two MAS boats, after an unsuccessful attack on Bar, reunited with the two destroyers. Guglielmo Pepe and Cesare Rossarol supported the operation, which concluded with the return of the ships to Brindisi at 09:00 on 15 May.\nOn 2 October 1918 Gulglielmo Pepe, Alessandro Poerio, Cesare Rossarol, Ippolito Nievo, and Simone Schiaffino were at sea with the battleship Dante Alighieri and the scout cruiser Carlo Alberto Racchia to provide distant cover for a British and Italian naval bombardment of Durrës. The main mission of Gulglielmo Pepe′s force was to counter any attack against the bombardment force by Austro-Hungarian ships based at Cattaro.\nBy late October 1918, Austria-Hungary had effectively disintegrated, and the Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed on 3 November 1918, went into effect on 4 November 1918 and brought hostilities between Austria-Hungary and the Allies to an end. On 10 November 1918, Guglielmo Pepe and Cesare Rossarol transported Italian infantry units to Pola to reinforce Italian units already occupying the city. World War I ended the next day, with an armistice between the Allies and the German Empire on 11 November 1918. On 27 November 1918, Guglielmo Pepe took possession of Rab, an island off the coast of Dalmatia.\n\n\n==== Post-World War I ====\nIn 1921, Guglielmo Pepe was reclassified as a destroyer. She made various cruises and took part in representation missions in the Aegean Sea and Black Sea.\nDuring 1936, Guglielmo Pepe underwent minor repairs and maintenance. With the Spanish Civil War underway, Fascist Italy sold Guglielmo Pepe (for a price of 5 million pesetas) and Alessandro Poerio, to the Nationalist faction in Spain. Handed over to the Spanish Nationalists at the end of October 1937, Guglielmo Pepe finally was stricken from the Regia Marina′s naval register on 5 January 1939.\n\n\n=== Spanish Navy ===\n\n\n==== Modifications ====\nThe Spanish Nationalists renamed the ship Teruel. An old ship by 1937, she had worn-out propulsion machinery and, in the view of the Nationalists, inadequate armament. She underwent major modifications in which her hull was lengthened by 1 metre (3 ft 3 in), her draft was reduced to 2.8 metres (9 ft 2 in), her original boilers were replaced by five Yarrow boilers, one 102 mm (4 in) gun and both 40 mm guns were removed, and two 37 mm and two 20 mm guns were installed. Her standard displacement dropped to 845 tons aand her full-load displacement to 911 tons, her maximum speed fell to 31 knots (57 km/h; 36 mph), and her crew rose to 130 men.\n\n\n==== Service history ====\nThe Spanish Nationalists took possession of Teruel at Sardinia at the end of October 1937. Manned by a Spanish crew, she departed Sardinia on 29 November 1937  bound for Palma de Mallorca on Mallorca in the Balearic Islands. Upon arrival, she joined the Nationalist destroyer flotilla based there and began convoy escort duties, support to ground operations, the interdiction of merchant ships of the Second Spanish Republic, and antisubmarine patrols. Among her most important achievements during the Spanish Civil War were the capture of the Soviet steamer Zyrianin and of the American tanker Nantucket Chief, which the Nationalists later handed over to international authorities at Gibraltar.\nOn 24 May 1938, Teruel got underway from Palma de Mallorca as part of a flotilla and that night collided with her sister ship, the destroyer Huesca (the former Alessandro Poero). Striking Huesca′s stern, Teruel proceeded to Cádiz for repairs.\nAfter the Spanish Civil War ended in victory for the Nationalists in 1939, Teruel was incorporated into the post-civil war Spanish Navy. She had proven mechanically unreliable during the conflict, and the Spanish Navy made no attempt to upgrade her capabilities after the civil war. Relegated to use as an auxiliary and training ship, she was stricken from the naval register on 17 August 1948. She subsequently was scrapped.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFavre, Franco. La Marina nella Grande Guerra.

She is credited with unifying the kingdom under a single monarch by seizing powers from the cadet branches of Yaksha Malla. During her reign, the Kingdom of Banepa, which included Banepa, Panauti, Dhulikhel, Nala was annexed into the Kingdom of Bhaktapur. The locals of Lubhu believe her to be the founder of their city, although the antiquity of the city can be dated before her reign. She is also credited with fortifying the city of Sankhu. She was believed to have been a pious leader by the locals and is popularly referred as \"Ganga Maharani\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bilbiography ===\nRegmi, Dili Raman (1966).

        "content": "Writing workshops are group sessions where writers gather to share, critique and improve their work. Various models of writing workshops have been developed over time to suit different educational settings and writing goals. Workshop attendance might be restricted to a select group (such as a writers' circle or class) or open to the public.\n\n\n== Workshop Models ==\nMost workshops include some kind of sharing of work, reflection upon and discussion of the work, and often suggestions for improvement. There may or may not be a facilitator, who is usually an established writer or teacher, but can be a volunteer from among the group. Workshops can work on very established rules and formats, or can be more freeform.\n\n\n== Traditional Workshop Model ==\nThe traditional workshop model, also known as the Iowa model, was developed at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop in the mid-20th century, under the directorship of Paul Engle. It typically involves:\n\nSubmission: Participants submit their writing in advance. Each participant is expected to read everyone else's work and come with feedback.\nCritique: During the workshop, participants take turns to provide feedback on each person's work in turn. When it's their turn to receive group critique, writers cannot speak (the \"gag rule\").\nDiscussion: After receiving critique, the writer engages in discussion with the group. This may include troubleshooting and answering questions about the work.\nThis model emphasises peer critique and iterative improvement, and is the most recognisable workshop model. The \"gag rule\" is the most contentious element of the workshop, since it silences authors, which might aggravate power imbalances in the workshop. Its original aim, however, is to prevent the author missing feedback by trying to defend or explain their work.\n\n\n== Guided Workshop Model ==\nThe guided workshop model incorporates elements of direct instruction alongside peer critique. It involves:\n\nMini-Lessons: Instructors provide short lessons on specific writing techniques.\nGuided Practice: Participants apply these techniques to their own writing.\nPeer Feedback: Writers exchange feedback on drafts, guided by the instructor's prompts.\nThis model aims to balance individualised instruction with collaborative learning. More advanced forms of guided workshop, particularly when they focus on a single element of craft, may be called masterclasses. One form of guided workshop designed for schools is the Writing Workshop (Greaves, et al.) developed by Donald Graves, Donald Murray, and other teacher/researchers.\n\n\n== The Draft Workshop ==\nThe 40-minute draft workshop,used at Princeton, aims to root critique in honest feedback, while also strengthening participants' critical reading and writing skills. The process is as follows:\n\nPrep Work\nDraft work is shared with participants.\nParticipants write a short letter responding to the draft, including a summary of what they think the work's motivation and thesis are, and identifying one strength and one weakness (using appropriate academic terminology). The letter should include ideas for revision to address the weakness.\nParticipants bring a copy of the letter for the writer, as well as retaining a copy for themselves.\nStep 1 (2 minutes)\nThe writer of the draft shares a brief statement of what they think the work's thesis is, and some brief hopes for revision.\nStep 2 (10 minutes)\nParticipants point out the text's strengths, always referring to the text for evidence.\nStep 3 (25 minutes)\nThe participants now identify weaknesses, again citing specific examples in the text, offering revision strategies where possible.\nStep 4 (3 minutes)\nThe writer reflects on the feedback, noting their priorities for revision, and thanks the participants for their contributions.\nBecause the participants are empowered to deliver feedback directly, rather than relying on a teacher to guide them, the process aims to phase out the use of a facilitator. Referring back to the text when making critiques, and using \"high-order Lexicon element[s]\", strengthens students' critical reading and writing skills, which is particularly useful in an academic setting. Writing feedback down in advance helps keep on discussion on track and provides a record of feedback if anything gets missed.\n\n\n== Critical Response Process ==\nIn 1990, Liz Lerman created the Critical Response Process (CRP), a highly structured method of feedback often used in creative writing. Lerman developed the Process after realising artists tended to apologise, rather than ask questions, when presenting unfinished work. An important point to note is that unsolicited feedback can't be shared. The relevant steps are:\n\nStatements of Meaning: The writer shares their work, while responders share what they find meaningful, memorable, or intriguing.\nQuestions from the Writer: The writer asks specific questions about aspects of their work they are uncertain about or seeking input on.\nNeutral Questions from Responders: Responders ask neutral questions to help the writer explore their work further, without giving direct advice.\nOpinions and Suggestions: Finally, responders can offer their opinions and suggestions, but only after the writer has had the chance to reflect on the feedback received.\nThis process encourages constructive dialogue and empowers writers to make informed decisions about their work. To make unsolicited feedback, a responder first has to ask the writer for permission in the final stage (Opinions and Suggestions); the writer can always say no.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Belomorite (Russian: Беломори́т — from the toponym), sometimes peristerite or moonstone, also murchisonite, Ceylon opal, hecatolite — a decorative variety of albite (oligoclase) of white or light gray color with a distinct iridescence effect. By composition, belomorite belongs to the feldspar family; it is a sodium aluminosilicate from the plagioclase group, in most cases belonging to the isomorphic series albite (Ab) — anorthite (An) with an approximate percentage of 70Ab-30An.\nThe name “belomorite” was given to this variety of albite by academician Alexander Fersman in 1925, based on the location of its discovery near the shore of the White Sea, and also by association — for the similarity of iridescence colors with the shades of sea water. The best varieties of belomorite are translucent or transparent, they have a pearl-glass luster and iridescence in blue, gray-blue, violet-blue, greenish-blue or pale violet tones. The most famous deposits of this gem are in the north, in the pegmatites of the Kola Peninsula and Karelia.\nBelomorite is a spectacular and popular jewelry and ornamental material, one of the varieties of moonstone. However, due to its fragility and perfect cleavage, the mineral often breaks and is difficult to process, so it is cut in the form of simple cabochons (oval, round, teardrop-shaped), as well as balls or polished plates.\n\n\n== History and name ==\nA decade and a half after the discovery of this variety of albite near the White Sea coast, Alexander Fersman described the history of his “find” in sufficient detail and accurately in a short lyrical essay entitled “Belomorite.” Together with his companion, he got off the train at the Arctic Circle station in the Loukhsky District of the Republic of Karelia and they set off together towards the “Blue Pale” — that was the name of the mined-out vein of feldspars, located in the middle of a swampy area, between hills (in Karelian - varaks) almost on the very shore of the White Sea, about six kilometers east of the station.\nThere, in an old working, among dark amphibole shales, there was a snow-white vein of albite at least ten meters long, it rose to the top of the neighboring hill and went with lateral branches into the dark stone of shale rocks. Alexander Fersman sat down near a stack of feldspar, folded for transportation, looked at it carefully and, as he writes, could no longer look away, — in front of him was “a white, barely bluish stone, barely translucent, barely transparent, but clean and even, like a well-ironed tablecloth.”\n\nThe stone was split along individual shiny surfaces, and some mysterious light played on these edges. These were gentle bluish-green, barely noticeable iridescences, only occasionally they flashed with a reddish light, but usually a continuous mysterious moonlight flooded the entire stone, and this light came from somewhere from the depths of the stone — well, just like the Black Sea burns with blue light in autumn evenings near Sevastopol.\nThe delicate pattern of the stone from some thin stripes crossed it in several directions, as if imposing a mysterious lattice on the rays emanating from the depths. I collected, selected, admired and again turned the moonstone towards the sun.\n\n— Alexander Fersman, “Memories of a Stone”, 1940\nThe stone found in an old mine was called “belomorite” — because, as Fersman explains, “The White Sea shimmered with the colors of moonstone... or did the stone reflect the pale blue depths of the White Sea?..” — Geologists took several samples to the Peterhof lapidary factory, recommending it as a new jewelry stone.\nMeanwhile, the authors of the “new mineral” did not insist that they had made some kind of mineralogical discovery, noting that the decorative variety of stone received from them a new poetic name or even a trademark. On the one hand, Fersman directly writes that belomorite “was not born there, it was we who invented it there”; and on the other hand, he calls this variety of feldspar “true moonstone”.\nIt must be remembered that the coast and, more broadly speaking, the environs of the White Sea are by no means the only place where Fersmanovsky belomorite, which belongs to the class of perhaps the most common rock-forming minerals on earth, reveals itself. Deposits of this type of plagioclase, most often associated with mica-bearing and ceramic pegmatites, are located in other places in North Karelia (the vicinity of Khetolambina, Mica Bor), as well as in the south of the Kola Peninsula.: 71 \nAnother name for iridescent feldspar — peristerite — also comes from its geographical name (Peristeri — a mountain in western Greece). Other regional synonyms of belomorite are used even less frequently — murchisonite, Ceylon opal and jarisol, associated with the sites of finds. There are also names like hecatolite: 94  associated with the crystallographic orientation of the iridescence. All of them, one way or another, can be attributed to local territorial or commercial brands, one way or another connected with the trade in jewelry or ornaments made from iridescent albite.: 35 \n\n\n== Properties ==\n\nThe reasons for the iridescence of belomorite have repeatedly been the subject of study, with generally consistent conclusions. Most researchers agreed that the bluish or greenish glow is associated with specific defects in the layered structure of the mineral. Alexander Fersman notes in his memoirs that the “mysterious light” emanating from the depths of the stone played precisely “on individual shiny surfaces,” lines of cleavage or fracture, naturally passing along the boundaries of the perfect cleavage of belomorite. This effect also appears much stronger and brighter after polishing the mineral.: 37 \nThe perfect cleavage of belomorite (peristerite) is manifested in its structure. The mineral consists of the thinnest (parallel) plates, almost invisible to the naked eye. Light, reflected from the internal cleavage planes, is refracted many times, which leads to spectacular color interference of light on spinodal decomposition structures commensurate with its wavelength. These properties of belomorite are by no means unique; their manifestations are characteristic of many minerals, collectively called “moon stones.” Also, other iridescent plagioclases, such as many labradorites, have a narrowly directed (within an approximate range of 15-20°) approximately along the b axis a colored iridescent reflection, most often manifested in beautiful blues and dark blues, less often in green, yellow or even reddish tones. Iridescence is a special type of pseudochromatism caused by the interference of light on spinodal decomposition structures commensurate with its wavelength. A similar effect is also occasionally typical for some potassium feldspars (orthoclases), anthophyllite, and quite often for enstatite and bronzite.: 641 \nThe characteristic optical effect of moonstones is most often called iridescence. However, the nature of their colored glow has a special specificity; it would be more accurate to call it adularescence (from the name of the titular mineral: adularia or moonstone). This effect is associated with the scattering of white light by very small submicroscopic point defects in the structure of the stone such as microperthite ingrowths, thin cleavage plates or spatial fluctuations in the internal composition. According to the Rayleigh scattering theory, short-wave radiation, other things being equal, is always scattered more strongly, and therefore the reflected and scattered light will have a bluer tint than the original one. In addition, belomorite sometimes exhibits weak orange luminescence in ultraviolet rays.\nAs a rule, belomorite forms solid granular and crystalline masses or massive crystalline aggregates; crystals of tabular and tabular-prismatic types are much less common. Complex polysynthetic twinning is very often observed.\n\n\n== Mineral formation ==\n\nBelomorite is of igneous origin; it is part of many granites and granite pegmatites. Albites (oligoclases) are very widespread throughout the world and are among the most common rock-forming minerals. Iridescent regional varieties, which are quite similar in composition and properties to belomorite, are naturally less common, but it would be wrong to call them rare minerals. Plagioclases with moonlight have long been known in some pegmatite veins of Shaitanka and Lipovka (Middle Urals), as well as in Utochkina Pad near Ulan-Ude (Buryatia).\nHigh-quality industrially significant belomorite, used in jewelry production, is mined mainly in Ceylon (most often called «Ceylon opal» there). Belomorites have also been found in large quantities in Madagascar, Tanzania, India, and the USA (California and Colorado). In addition, local deposits of iridescent albite are known in Australia, Austria, Germany, Italy, Kenya, Norway, Poland, Ukraine, as well as in France, Switzerland, Sweden and Japan.: 15 \nTypical (title) deposits of belomorite are located in North Karelia, where this stone was discovered by Alexander Fersman, as well as in the south of the Kola Peninsula.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nBelomorite is a spectacular, inexpensive and popular ornamental stone; it is used in jewelry as one of the varieties of “moonstone”. It is typically cut into cabochons, often double-sided, convex in both directions, thus enhancing its brilliance, unlike, say, similar labradorite, which is often cut into flat plates cut parallel to the cleavage lines.\nAt the same time, the brittleness and perfect cleavage of belomorites serves as a natural obstacle in the process of their processing. As a result, the mineral often breaks and is difficult to produce, also for this reason it is most often cut in the form of simple cabochons (oval, round, teardrop-shaped), as well as balls, taking into account existing cracks and cleavage lines. Moonstones are at the top of the list in terms of the number of synthetic minerals (counterfeits) that enter the market under the guise of natural minerals. In addition to the brighter effect of iridescence, artificial minerals are not as fragile and vulnerable as their natural counterparts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlbite\nOligoclase\nPlagioclase\nFeldspar\nIceland spar\nMoonstone\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Belomorite at Wikimedia Commons\n\nBelomorite (A material that is NOT an approved mineral species): information about the mineral belomorite in the Mindat database.\nMoonstone (Belomorite) in the database Mineralienatlas",

        "content": "On 20 July 1992, a Tupolev Tu-154B cargo plane crashed during takeoff from Tbilisi-Novo Alexeyevka Airport in Georgia. The aircraft failed to become airborne and struck a residential area, killing all 24 on board and four more people on the ground. An investigation revealed that the aircraft's cargo was improperly loaded and partially undocumented, causing it to become overloaded. \n\n\n== Aircraft ==\nThe Tupolev Tu-154B aircraft was manufactured in 1977 with the serial number USSR-85222. It was powered by three Kuznetsov NK-8-2U turbofan engines. The aircraft had previously been operated by Russian airline Aeroflot. During the 1980 Summer Olympics, it bore the Official Olympic Carrier livery.\n\n\n== Flight ==\nThe cargo flight operated either by Transair Georgia or Tbilisi Aviation Enterprise was scheduled from Tbilisi in Georgia to Russia's Mineralnye Vody, carrying tea. The aircraft was carrying eight crew and sixteen passengers; none of the passengers had tickets and did not receive official permission to be on the flight.\nThe aircraft began its takeoff procedure on runway 31L. While the nose gear lifted off the runway at V1 speed, the main landing gears failed to become airborne. The nose only reached an angle of 6–7°. It rolled past the runway and continued for about 490 m (1,610 ft) before barrelling into a localizer. The impact caused the aircraft to roll over. After traveling for another 190 m (620 ft), it impacted homes in the village of Alekseevka and caught fire. Everyone on board died, along with four people on the ground, although Georgian media said there were as many as 30 ground fatalities. Ten people on the ground were also injured.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nOfficials began suspecting the crash was due to overloading as the aircraft failed to lift off the ground. The investigation revealed that the flight crew and ground personnel at the cargo warehouse had violated regulations for loading cargo. Twenty tons of cargo was present on board, exceeding the maximum allowed weight. The loading of cargo was also improperly done and not all the cargo was recorded; flight documents only recorded 6.4 tons. The cargo placement also violated the Tu-154B's alignment standards. Three tons of load was added without the crew's knowledge, overloading the aircraft by two tons. This altered the aircraft's center of gravity.\nThe airport transport management and cargo warehouse was a single corporation before separating into two different entities; the airport management did not oversee cargo flights although this arrangement was not officially removed. The airport loading and balance controllers ceased operations for cargo flights while the warehouse company (Lasare) did not provide such services as they did not have relevant employees. As a result, the loading of cargo went unmonitored.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lie To Me is an EP by American rock band Garbage. It was released on April 20, 2024 on Record Store Day through BMG/Stunvolume in the United States and UK, and its subsidiary Infectious Music in Europe. The EP includes the two previously unreleased tracks, \"Better Not Lie To Me\" and \"Revenge and Hurt\"; a cover of \"Song For the Siren\" by Tim Buckley and a new remix of Bleed Like Me track \"Bad Boyfriend\" featuring Dave Grohl.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn February 7, 2024, Garbage announced the release of the Bleed Like Me Expanded Reissue, compiling the 2005 album, its b-sides and some of the remixes and unreleased tracks from that era. On February 15, the band announced their participation to Record Store Day 2024 with the exclusive release of the Lie To Me EP. The release follows the band's previous year Witness To Your Love EP and happened during the band's recording sessions for their eighth studio album.\nThe cover art is a photo of singer Shirley Manson taken by the band's sound engineer Billy Bush in June 2017.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe first two songs on the EP, \"Better Not Lie To Me\" and \"Revenge and Hurt\", are out-takes from the Bleed Like Me sessions. The former features vocals from all members of Garbage in the chorus and was co-written by Rancid's ex-member Tim Armstrong.\n\"Song to the Siren\", originally a song by Tim Buckley, is based on the This Mortal Coil version and pays homage to the British collective. It was originally recorded for a TV show, but the authors decided not to use it.\nThe \"Bad Boyfriend\" remix features more emphasis on drums, provided by Dave Grohl.\nThe first three tracks were recorded at the band's engineer Billy Bush's Red Razor Sounds, in Atwater Village, and at Butch Vig's GrungeIsDead, in Silverlake. The last song was recorded at the band's Smart Studios, in Madison, at GrungeIsDead, and at co-producer John King's The Boat recording studio.\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe EP was originally released as a Record Store Day exclusive, on April 20, on transparent lime-colored vinyl limited to 2,500 copies in the US and 1,000 in the UK, with a digital release coming later.\nThe digital release followed two weeks later, on May 3. It was accompanied by a visualizer for \"Song To the Siren\" made by visual artist Marcin Pospiech.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Reference list ==",

It was made shortly before his trip to Europe on the academy bursary (1854–1860).\nThe vast panorama of the Neva is shown on a serene winter day.\nThe composition's frame covers the architecture of the Palace Embankment; the Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral's spire glistens in the sunlight (left). It shows in considerable detail windows of houses on the other Neva's bank.\nThe \"heart\" of former Russia's capital in a folk celebration. The wooden theatre with fair performances and trade in small shops allows to assume that the artist is painting a picture during Maslenitsa week. St. Petersburg residents cross the frozen river from one bank to the other in sledges, on horses, and in kibitka. The artist masterly depicted movements of people and horses, which makes the street scene \"dynamic\". The artist is keen on the details: he scrupulously elaborates citizens' clothes. One of the right-sided personages passing along the stone banister of the quay and turning to the viewer.\nWhite clouds are sedately floating in the blue sky background. Bogolyubov could convey the freshness of the frosty air.\n\n\n== References ==",

For a novice, the author has shown much knowledge of stage effect. The characters are not well developed.\"\nBell's Life said it \"has been nightly repeated with very equivocal success.\" The Illawara Mercury said \"As most of the scenes were laid in\nand about Sydney, they could not fail to bo appreciated by the audience.\"\nThe Empire said \"The drama is colonial, and some of the streets and localities of Sydney were depicted with great effect.\" A writer to the same ppaere said \"Unequivocal marks of approbation from all parts of the house attended the progress of the piece, and the curtain fell amid general and hearty applause, notwithstanding the defection of some who had been calculated upon.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Konradas Juozas Aleksa (19 February 1881 – 6 November 1956) was a Lithuanian veterinarian, agronomist, sociologist, archeologist, and zoologist. He is best known as a professor of the Vytautas Magnus University Agriculture Academy and one of the creators of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Veterinary Academy. Aleksa introduced veterinary to Lithuania and was Lithuania's first proponent of eugenics.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nKonradas Juozas Aleksa was born on 19 February 1881 in the village of Obelupiai in Congress Poland of the Russian Empire. His brothers were Zigmas Angarietis (later a Communist revolutionary) and Jonas Pranas Aleksa (an agronomist). Aleksa collected Lithuanian folklore and folk songs in his youth, which would be lost during World War I. In 1899 Aleksa graduated from the Marijampolė Gymnasium, and then traveled to Warsaw to study at the Warsaw Institute of Veterinary Medicine. On 1 May 1901 he participated in an anti-Tsarist demonstration in Warsaw, where he was injured and arrested. In 1903 he graduated from the Warsaw Institute of Veterinary Medicine, where he continued working. He also practiced veterinary at Šakiai, Kalvarija, and Balaklava. Until the beginning of the First World War, he collected scientific knowledge and wrote in the press.\n\n\n=== Conscription in Russian armies ===\nAleksa joined the Russian Imperial Army and fought in the Russo-Japanese War from 1904 to 1905. As a person with a medical background, Aleksa served as a medic during the First World War. Aleksa was elected as a regimental delegate to the Russian Army Congress to represent non-Russian people, i.e. people from the occupied territories. Aleksa was elected senior veterinarian in the city of Daugavpils (Dvinsk), but his regiment soon deserted the Russian army, which at that time was in complete disarray. Aleksa traveled back to famine-ridden Balaklava, where his family lived at the time. Aleksa later got a job as a clerk in the city municipality's office to financially provide for his exhausted family and recover. Aleksa was soon mobilized into Lieutenant General Anton Denikin's army, being discharged only when he fell seriously ill. After recovering, he worked in the Balaklava city cooperative. However, Aleksa was then mobilized for a second time under General Pyotr Wrangel. After Wrangel's forces ultimately lost against the Bolshevik forces, Aleksa became a prisoner of war.\nIn 1920 he was imprisoned by the new Russian government and tried by the NKVD troika. It is said that Aleksas's defense speech in court saved his life; Aleksa claimed that representatives of peoples enslaved by the Russian Tsar could not be volunteers in the White Army, and so consequently Aleksa ended up in it against his will. After Aleksa's speech, him and one Latvian were acquitted, while the others were shot. In 1922 he got a job in Kharkov in the Lithuanian embassy. After he formed an echelon of Lithuanian war exiles in Crimea, he arrived in Lithuania in the summer of 1922. He and his wife Marija Aleksienė née Kožanevska adopted two children.\n\n\n=== Professor in Lithuania ===\nFrom 1922 to 1924 Aleksa lectured at the Dotnuva School of Agriculture, and the Vytautas Magnus University Agriculture Academy from 1924 to 1938. From 1926 to 1927 and from 1928 to 1936 he was a prorector. In 1923 Aleksa became one of the creators of the Lithuanian Veterinary Doctor Academy, being its chairman for a few years. From 1932 to 1938 Aleksa was a permanent representative of Lithuania at the Office International des Epizooties in Paris. Aleksa was made professor in 1927. In 1928 he was awarded the Order of the Grand Duke Gediminas, 3rd degree. Aleksa was the first to do sociological research on women living in urban villages, publishing the book Lietuvos moteris sodietė in 1932 with his own funds, distributing copies for free.\nIn 1930 he opened a new Household Section in the Agriculture Academy, where female household agronomists were trained. Aleksa was one of the main creators of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Veterinary Academy, being its lecturer from 1938 to 1940. Aleksa was a co-author of a book on veterinary published in 1936 in Toulouse. Aleksa was the first to write on the history of veterinary in Lithuania and do research on coprology. Aleksa was also one of the first to create Lithuanian names for veterinary terms and to study zoopsychology. As an archeologist, Aleksa was the first to study horse skeletons in mass graves in Lithuania. Aleksa contributed to numerous publications such as Karys, Gamta, Lietuvos žinios, and Naujoji Romuva. From 1931 to 1944 he wrote articles for the Lietuviškoji enciklopedija (Lithuanian Encyclopedia), the first Lithuanian encyclopedia.\n\n\n=== Later years ===\nDuring the Nazi occupation of Lithuania, Aleksa declined a more career-prospective position, which in turn would please the local Nazi government, and as such was prohibited from living and working in Kaunas. From 1941 to 1944 he was the head of the Vilnius District's veterinary hospital. He was also the head of the Department of Special Zootechnics, being made an honorary doctor in 1941 and its prorector from 1944 until 1946. From 1944 to 1956 Aleksa again was made lecturer of the Veterinary Academy. Aleksa wrote for the underground Lithuanian press, and during Soviet occupation secretly lectured students on genetics, which was prohibited at the time. For his illegal lectures, private property and recognition of Western scientists, Aleksa was regularly criticized and persecuted by the Soviet government. \nHe died on 6 November 1956. He was buried in the Eiguliai Cemetery in Kaunas.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Loch Aisir Mòr is a lochan or small loch in Scotland's Flow Country. It is situated about one mile from the western coast of Sutherland, at the northeast edge of Oldshoremore, a scattered crofting settlement, and about two miles north of the larger settlement of Kinlochbervie. The lochan is surrounded by heathland. A claybed lines its north shore. Its outflow to the sea is Abhainn Aisir Mhòr, a river about one mile long.\nIts name means \"Loch of the Big Pass\" in Scottish Gaelic, perhaps referring to the gap between the hills of Eilear na Mola and Cnoc na Bearaich through which the  river flows. \nThe loch appears in the photography collections of Scottish botanist Robert M. Adam, dated 1953.\nThe Rhiconich Estate allows fly fishing for the local angling club from the loch's shores.\n\n\n== References ==",

It debuted in Sydney in April 1854.\nThe play was abut a fictitious bushranger, Charles Graves, and included \"a grand series of equestrian feats, bare backed riding.\"\n\n\n== Reaction ==\nA writer in Empire newspaper found the play a \"new piece of rather questionable tendency\" adding, \"The scene is laid in Australia and occupied by characters who ‘left their country for their country’s good.' We think the selection of plays of a more moral nature would ensure an audience that would better appreciate the talent of the actor.\"\nAccording to historian Margaret Williams, \"If the appearance of a bushranger on the Sydney stage is notable in itself, so is the review, for it marks the end of a decade in which local pieces of a questionable moral tendency never appeared to be reviewed at all.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nAustralian Bunyips\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Mary Rosalia Agnela Odette Rodrigues (4 September 1968 – 13 September 2013), known professionally as Rosalia Rodrigues, was an Indian theatre actress and singer who worked on the Konkani stage.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMary Rosalia Agnela Odette Rodrigues was born on 4 September 1968. She hailed from the locality of Patto in Ribandar, Goa, and emerged as an artist with a passion for music and acting. Rodrigues, the eldest of four children, was born to Luis Rodrigues, a civil servant, and Milagrina Conceição Fernandes, a homemaker. She had two sisters Marionette (born 1969), and Sandra, and a brother Austin (born 1971). From an early age, she displayed an inclination towards the arts. Encouraged by her father, who himself was a musician and scriptwriter, Rodrigues found a nurturing environment for her talents in the tiatrs, a unique form of Goan musical theatre, held in her hometown of Ribandar.\nRodrigues's journey into the limelight began during her primary school years, where she took to the Konkani stage with gusto. The theatrical performances in the local communities of Patto and Fondvem served as ideal venues for Rodrigues to exhibit her artistic abilities. Demonstrating aptitude both as an actress and a singer, Rodrigues quickly gained recognition as a child artist. Luis, father of Rodrigues, coordinated theatrical productions known as tiatrs in their hometown of Ribandar, where Rodrigues and her siblings were given the chance to demonstrate their artistic skills. In 1978, at the age of nine, Rodrigues received a special award for her singing talent in the tiatr production Bodlo, written by Konkani playwright Danny Fernandes. This honor was bestowed as part of the 5th Tiatr Competition held by the Kala Academy Goa during the 1978–1979 season.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRodrigues was an acclaimed actress known for her performances in the tiatr, a form of Goan theater. She garnered recognition and was honored with several awards, notably the Best Actress Award, which she consistently won for three successive years in the tiatr competitions held by the Kala Academy in Panaji. Rodrigues showcased her talent for portraying tragic characters, captivating audiences with her emotive and powerful portrayals. Her understanding of the nuances of tragedy allowed her to deliver performances that left an impact on the audience. Not only was Rodrigues an actress, but she also possessed a singing voice. Her vocal abilities earned her additional accolades and prizes throughout her career. Her performances added an extra layer of depth and artistry to her theatrical endeavors. In addition to her involvement in tiatr, Rodrigues expanded her repertoire by participating in fells, which are traditional Goan street plays performed during the festive Carnival season in Goa. This further demonstrated her versatility as an actress and her commitment to exploring diverse forms of dramatic expression.\n\nRodrigues also made contributions to the commercial theater scene. She collaborated with Konkani tiatrists, including Comedian Agostinho, Comedian 64, Maxcy Pereira, Peter-Roshan, etc. Her involvement in these productions further solidified her reputation as a versatile performer. Rodrigues' impact on the Goan theater community extended beyond her acting and singing abilities. Her last known appearances in Goa included roles in former police officer and Konkani playwright Sammy Tavares' 2012 tiatr Aplean Bhurgeam Sangatak (With Their Children) and Konkani singer Junior Reagan's Teacher (2013), where she portrayed the role of a headmistress. These performances showcased her ability to bring characters to life with authenticity and conviction.\nRodrigues is known for her participation in various tiatr competitions organized by Kala Academy, Panaji. She made her debut as a child singer in 1978 and later took part in the 23rd Tiatr Competition (1997–1998) organized by Kala Academy Goa. In this competition, she was selected for the tiatr titled Dhondo (Business) directed by Diogo Fernandes, which was performed in Panaji in November 1997. Rodrigues portrayed the character of Aysha in the play, and her performance earned her a merit certificate in the female acting category. Additionally, she received a certificate in the duo category alongside her long-time castmate Gracy Rodrigues, with whom she had been performing since 1978. The following year, Rodrigues continued her involvement in the tiatr scene by participating in the 24th Tiatr Competition (1998–1999), once again directed by Diogo. She was cast in the theatrical production Sombondh (Relationship), where she portrayed the character of Ravina. Her acting skills led to her receiving another merit certificate in the female acting category. The play was staged in Panaji in 1998. In addition to her acting contributions, Rodrigues also made significant contributions as a duet singer in the same production. Her collaboration with Newton D'Souza in the duet earned them a cash prize of ₹250 (equivalent to ₹1,100 or US$14 in 2023).\nDuring the late 1990s, Rodrigues actively participated in professional state tiatr competitions, which became a significant part of her career. One notable event was her involvement in the 25th Tiatr Competition held by the Kala Academy Goa in 1999–2000. In this competition, Rodrigues was cast in the tiatr titled Ekuch Kuttumbh (One Family), written by Diogo Fernandes, a Konkani playwright. This marked Rodrigues's third collaboration with Fernandes on a theatrical production. In Ekuch Kuttumbh, Rodrigues portrayed the character of Shanti and received the second-place award for Best Acting in the female category, along with a cash prize of ₹750 (equivalent to ₹3,200 or US$40 in 2023). As the 2000s began, Rodrigues continued her active participation in tiatr competitions. She took part in the 26th Tiatr Competition held in 2000–2001, once again under the direction of Diogo Fernandes. In this competition, she appeared in Diogo's tiatr titled Vishwass (Trust), playing the role of Sylvia. Rodrigues's performance earned her a merit certificate for acting in the female category. It is worth mentioning that Rodrigues had been associated with the Dramatic Troupe of Ribandar, led by Diogo Fernandes, since 1997. Prior to joining this troupe, she had started her journey as a child artist with the Clubo desportivo dos Jovens de Ribandar (transl. Youth Sports Club Ribandar), headed by Danny Fernandes. However, after her performance in 1978, Rodrigues left the club and joined Diogo and his fellow castmates, marking the beginning of a collaboration between them.\nRodrigues actively participated in tiatr competitions organized by the Kala Academy in Panaji throughout the 2000s. In the 28th Tiatr Competition held during 2002–2003, she delivered a performance as Sonia in the tiatr production called Sharonaeta (2002), which was written by her long-time collaborator Diogo Fernandes. Her acting skills earned her the first prize in the Best Acting category for female performers. The following year, Rodrigues, as a member of the Dramatic Troupe of Ribandar, took part in the 29th Tiatr Competition of 2003–2004. She played the role of Mary in Diogo's tiatr Parashrayee, and once again, she secured the first prize for Best Acting in the female category, along with a cash prize of ₹1,000 (equivalent to ₹3,700 or US$46 in 2023). During the early 2000s, Rodrigues achieved success and gained recognition from the state cultural institution, Kala Academy. She continued to pursue her passion and participated in subsequent professional tiatr competitions. In the 30th Tiatr Competition of 2004–2005, Rodrigues portrayed the character of Sarah in Diogo's tiatr Dhaago (Threads). Her performance in this role earned her the first prize for Best Acting in the female category, along with a cash prize of ₹1,000 (equivalent to ₹3,500 or US$44 in 2023). Rodrigues' involvement in tiatr competitions concluded in 2007, at the 33rd Tiatr 'A Group' competition of 2007–2008. In Diogo's tiatr production Dolleam Add, she played the role of Milly and received a merit certificate for her acting performance in the female category. This marked the end of Rodrigues' ten-year collaboration with playwright Diogo Fernandes and his theatrical group, the Dramatic Troupe of Ribandar.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRodrigues never married or had any children, unlike her siblings who were married and had children. Her father, Luis, who was a civil servant and trumpeter, died on 22 May 2006. His funeral took place on 23 May, and he was buried in his hometown of Ribandar. In addition to her involvement in theater, Rodrigues worked at the Goa Daman and Diu Industrial Development Corporation (GDDIDC) in Panjim, which was later renamed to the Goa Industrial Development Corporation (Goa I.D.C). She resided in the neighborhood of Patto in Ribandar until her death in 2013.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nOn 13 September 2013, Rodrigues, aged 45, died at Esperança Hospital in the beach area of Miramar, Goa, in the state capital of Panaji. She had celebrated her 45th birthday just nine days ago. Despite performing on the stage the same year in Junior Reagan's tiatr Teacher in May 2013, Rodrigues' cause of death was undisclosed. Her funeral was held the next day on 14 September, where she was laid to rest at Nossa Senhora de Ajuda Church (also known as Our Lady of Help Church) in her hometown of Ribandar.\n\n\n=== Reactions ===\n\nGoa World, an online news website that is no longer operational, published a tribute in honor of Rodrigues and expressed their condolences. Francis de Verna, who was the president of Kuwait-Goa Tiatristanchi Sonvstha (KGTS) at that time, along with the managing committee and other members, extended their condolences to Rodrigues' family.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Carey Richards (November 24, 1818 – May 19, 1892) was an American magazine editor, author, and Baptist minister, known for his contributions to literature and magazines of the Southern United States during the 19th century.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRichards was born in London, England on November 24, 1818, to William Richards, a Baptist minister, and Anne Gardener Richards. Richards immigrated to the United States in 1831 with his family, settling initially in New York City, where his father became the minister of a church in Hudson, before the rest of the family relocated to Penfield, Georgia.\nRichards stayed in New York and attended Colgate University (then called Madison University), before graduating and moving to Penfield in 1840. In 1841, Richards married Cornelia Richards (née Bradley), also a writer, having met her in New York.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRichards began professionally writing with contributions to the Augusta Mirror, a literary paper published between 1838 and 1841. He later contributed to various periodicals, including the Southern Ladies' Book and Family Companion (Macon, Georgia), the Southern Quarterly Review (Charleston, South Carolina), the Christian Review (Boston, Massachusetts) and The Knickerbocker (New York).\nIn the 1840s, Richards started his own publications, beginning with the Orion, a literary magazine aimed at fostering literature in the South. This was named after the Orion constellation. Orion featured works by prominent Southern writers of the time, including William Gilmore Simms, as well as well-known Northern writers.\nHe later founded the Southern Literary Gazette (Athens, Georgia) and the educational magazine Schoolfellow (Athens).\n\n\n== Later years ==\nIn the 1850s, Richards shifted his focus to the ministry, serving pastorates in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Illinois until his death. He continued to write, mainly on religious topics and physical science, popularising these subjects through his lectures in the United States and Canada.\nHe died on May 19, 1892, at the age of 73 in Chicago.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nRichards made notable contributions to literature during his relatively short career as a magazine editor, particularly in the South. His magazines, including Orion and the Southern Literary Gazette, aimed to promote Southern writers and cultivate literary growth in the region. Additionally, his publication, the Schoolfellow, contributed to the emergence of popular children's magazines.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\n— (1853).

Richards (born June 19, 1842; Midway, Georgia), Herbert V. Richards (born October 26, 1849), Mabel Richards (born February 26, 1856), Cornelia H. Richards (born April 20, 1858), and Cecil A.

        "content": "Count József Kemény of Magyargyerőmonostor (Gerend, 11 September 1795 – Gerend, 12 September 1855) was a Hungarian historian, archaeologist and art collector, and a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the Imperial Academy of Vienna, and the Academy of Paris.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe belonged to the branch of the Kemény family that descended from John Kemény, the Prince of Transylvania and the autobiographer. His father was Baron Farkas Kemény, his mother was Countess Teréz Batthyány, sister of the learned Transylvanian bishop Ignác Batthyány. His only sister was Polyxena, she was five years younger than him.\nHis primary school education continued under the care of his tutor, Ignác Fekete. At the age of ten he entered the grammar school of the Piarists in Kolozsvár (today Cluj-Napoca, Romania) and in 1807, after completing the grammar second class, he remained the first of 44 pupils among the 34 students for a whole year. His eccentric father was raised to the rank of count on 12 August 1808.\nAfter the lyceum he studied at the Law Academy in Kolozsvár from 1812, and in 1814, at his father's request, he entered the civil service. In 1814, he was elected a judge of the Kolozs County Court, but soon moved to the Gubernium seated in Kolozsvár, where he was sworn in as a chancery official on 9 January 1815. In 1818, his father arranged for him to be an apprentice at the Transylvanian Court Chancellery in Vienna, because of his poetry. He fell in love with Anna Láng, the daughter of a Carinthian noble teacher, a 20-year-old girl of rare education, and married her in the autumn of 1821 without his father's knowledge or consent. The hitherto idle Count became a diligent official at the Chancellery.\nIn 1823, he made the great mistake of his career, which only after a long period of careful work he managed to erase, because during a dispute with a Romanian historian he anonymously sent him 2 documents that confirmed the Romanian historian's position. When the Romanian historian included these two documents in his book, Kemény laughed at him and revealed that the two letters were forgeries. After this scandal, he did not attempt anything similar, but devoted his life to serious research.\nHis father's strictness eased somewhat and in 1826 he was allowed to return to Transylvania with his wife and son. He lived for nearly two years in the Altorja  (today Turia, Romania) mansion of Baron Lázár Apor until he was reconciled with his father.\nHe moved to Nagyszeben (today Sibiu, Romania) and in the summer of 1827 became honorary secretary to the treasury. After the death of his father (20 September 1830), he inherited his father's fortune. Shortly afterwards his 12-year-old daughter Malvina died.\nIn 1830, he wrote five articles in the Scientific Collection about the Romanians of Transylvania, his own family, the deer on the coat of arms of Kemény family, the old Székely poet Szőke Ambrus Gelenczei, and the literature of \"the lost children of the city of Hameln and the fable of the origin of the Transylvanian Saxons\".\nWith his own money he built an Orthodox church for the Romanians on his estate.\nIn 1831, he was given the rank of a Transylvanian treasury secretary. For twenty years he served free of charge in Kolozsvár, Vienna and Nagyszeben, but under the influence of his father, who opposed his marriage, he was not promoted to more than honorary governorate. He disliked official life, and resigned his post in 1834 to devote himself purely to science. Already in Vienna, he devoted himself mainly to research and science. It was at this time that he laid the foundations of his collection of copies of diplomas.\nDuring the Hungarian Revolution of 1848/49, his estate was looted and many valuable works of art were taken from his famous collection.\nHe was among the first to work on economic history. He collected the relics of the trade and industry of Transylvania and wrote its history in 1833. He was a pioneer in the protection of Hungarian monuments. His work, apart from the initial \"joke\" forgery scandal, is both authentic and careful, which is why he has been elected a member of many scientific societies. For his merits, he was elected a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1831, followed by membership of the Imperial Academy of Vienna and then of the Academy of Paris, among a number of associations at home and abroad. His health was undermined by unremitting work and he died relatively young at his castle in Gerend.\n\n\n== References ==",

The book talk about her journey from Kenya to the United Kingdom. The book includes political history,family history,poetry, and news coverage.\n\n\n== About the book ==\nMigritude focuses on how black African women and diasporic groups are positioned and repositioned in the language of global concern. By examining the subaltern discourse, this piece rethinks what is deemed \"home\" in the queer imaginary. To represent the subaltern, whose concerns are exemplified by the perpetuation of institutional violence upon their bodies, this paper critiques heteronormativity.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was constructed in Gothic Revival style in the years 1898–1900 to a design by architect Hendrik Geirnaert, as the parish church for the expanding 'Heirnis' section of the city. The new parish was established on 14 May 1896, but the Liberal majority on the local council initially opposed the building of a new church. The church was consecrated on 25 July 1901, by bishop Antoon Stillemans. The organ was built by Brussels organ maker Pierre Scheyven. It has been inventoried as built heritage since 1983.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"PS5\" American singer-songwriter Salem Ilese and Yonjun and Taehyun from the Korean boy group Tomorrow X Together, featuring British-Norwegian DJ and record producer Alan Walker, It was released on February 23, 2022. The song is known for a vocal remix by Abdul Cisse, known as the Fortnite Battlepass guy. An official remix 3 months later, with Cisse replacing TXT as the secondary vocalist and Walker's trap production. The song appeared on Salem's third studio extended play, Unsponsored Content.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe song was originally written over a year ago in response to Selem's boyfriend and roommate being video game fanatics, and as soon as they moved to LA, they bought a PlayStation and Selem had a hard time keeping their attention and the expression \"Who do you take, me or PS5?\" was the expression that came to mind, and he began to produce it. However, Salem felt that the song \"still lacked something,\" so he approached Walker and TXT, his collaborators from 2021, to complete the piece. Selem says, \"Now that I have a great song, I am grateful to Playstation for the opportunity.\nYeonjun and Taehyun also commented: \"We're very lucky to have the opportunity to sing in multiple languages, and we're always excited to take on new challenges. Salem created an irresistibly ear-catching, addictive song and it's certain a lot of us will be playing the song on repeat.\"\nOn March 30, 2022, Ilese posted a TikTok revealing that the song was originally titled \"PS4\", because she had written it before the PlayStation 5 was released. A user commented \"you should do like ps5 then ps4 and keep going to the old ones\" to which Ilese responded \"this is a great idea, me or the ps3 coming soon\". On April 2, 2022, Ilese posted a TikTok of the \"PS3\" variant, on April 10, she posted a TikTok of the \"PS2\" variant, on April 16, she posted a TikTok of the \"Xbox X\" variant, and on April 20, she posted a TikTok of the \"PS1\" variant.\n\n\n== Music Video ==\nOn August 9, 2022, the music video for the song was released. It features YouTube Creator Ted Nivision and Salem Ilese in a mid-century modern home together. Ted plays a game on the TV that features a pixel avatar of Salem Ilese. The MV was directed by Christina Xing and produced by Our Secret Handshake, with pixel art VFX done by Reshma Zachariah.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Janko Jolović (January 14, 1897 in Bandin Odžak - September 1942), was a Yugoslav partisan and the first president of the Regional National Liberation Committee in Rogatica.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nJanko was born on January 14, 1897, in Bandin Odžak on Glasinac plateau near Sarajevo. He comes from a working class but wealthy family. After the First World War, he married Ljubica, with whom he had a daughter, Jela, and three sons.↵Several members of the Jolović family were members of the Serbian volunteer units in Russia and on the Thessaloniki front. Janko's older brother, Milivoje Jolović, participated in the October Revolution as a Red Army fighter. After returning from Russia in 1923, he tried to convince Janko to flee to Russia, where the proletariat is in power. Janko refused and remained in his country, working and later fighting for workers and peasants' wellbeing.\n\n\n=== Public and political engagements ===\nAt the outset of the Second World War, Janko was among the first partisans fighting Germans, with a goal of defense and ultimately liberation of people regardless of their religion and ethnicity.\nHe is listed as a member of the leadership of the KPJ and SKOJ in Sokolac - as part of the organ of the revolutionary movement before the armed uprising. Janko's party task was to organize forest workers in Romanija. On that occasion, Hasan Brkić stayed with him on several occasions, with whom he arranged the organization of URS woodworkers' unions.\nThe following were chosen for the headquarters of the Romanija company, which had to expel the Ustashe and gendarmes from the region: Slaviša Vajner Čiča (company commander), Pavle Goranin Ilija (commissioner), Oskar Danon Jovo (assistant commander), Danilo Đokić (assistant commander), Slobodan Princip, Mihailo Obrenović and Brnako Milutinović \"Obren\" (staff members).\nJanko and Čiča organized gatherings in Bandina Odžak and invited people from all the villages of Glasinac to join the company. Janko visited Serbian, Croatian and Muslim villages, organized village guards, listed volunteers and assigned them to Čiča's company.\nIn August 1941, he participated in the liberation of Sokolac, Vlasenica and surrounding towns. In September of the same year, the free territory extended from Romanija all the way to the Drina. Soon after that, the KPJ District Committee was formed in Romanija, of which Janko was a member.\nThe liberation of Rogatica followed. The attack lasted until 16–23. October, when native and Ustasha troops were expelled from Rogatica. Immediately after the liberation, Janko approached the formation of the County NOO, whose president he was elected at the suggestion of Slaviša Vajner.\n\n\n=== Capture and death ===\nIn the spring of 1942, Janko retreated with the people from Foča towards the Piva. However, the supreme headquarters in Vrbnica made a decision that all units from Romanija would break through back to their terrain and continue the fight. Groups started to break through as soon as they were ready to move. Janko led a larger group of people with several fighters to Romanija. When they arrived in the village of Borija, they were surrounded by Chetniks. All fighters surrendered to protect the people. A group of about fifteen partisans from Romanija was taken to the forest towards Borija for shooting, but the shooting was abandoned at the last moment, so they were handed over to the Ustashe authorities in Trnovo. The Ustashe took them from Trnovo to prison in Sarajevo. Janko was soon returned to Rogatica by the Ustaše, where he was imprisoned in the Regional Government (the place where his Regional People's Committee is also located). After the intervention of the people of Rogatica, Janko was released from prison.\nDuring the night of September 11, he was caught in a shepherd's hut on Bandina Odžak, by the Chetnik Dobrica Đukić and his Chetnik group. The Chetniks wounded his wife Ljubica by stabbing her multiple times with a bayonets, and Janko was kept tied to a spruce tree for four days. On the fifth day, Dobrica Đukić and Dušan Vuković took him under the Romanija Cliffs, a steep karstic rock face featuring a deep jama (cave) called Zvek or Bezdan, they tortured him and threw him alive into the pit.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA street in the Sarajevo neighborhood of Dobrinja bears his name.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ourisia simpsonii is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to high-elevation habitats in the South Island of New Zealand. Mary Kalin Arroyo elevated O. simpsonii to species rank in 1984. Plants of this species of New Zealand mountain foxglove are perennial, small-leaved herbs that are covered in a mixture of long glandular and non-glandular hairs. They have hairy, crenate, ovate leaves that are in a basal rosette. The flowers are single or in pairs in each node, with a zygomorphic calyx and corolla. The corolla is white and the corolla tube is yellow and glabrous inside, and purple outside. It is listed as Not Threatened.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nOurisia simpsonii (L.B.Moore) Arroyo is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. Lucy Moore first described O. sessilifolia var. simpsonii L.B.Moore in 1961, and Mary Kalin Arroyo elevated it to species level as O. simpsonii in 1984 due to the numerous morphological differences that distinguish them.\nThe type material was collected by Robert Brockie at Mt Garfield, South Island, New Zealand. The holotype is housed at the Allan Herbarium of Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research, and there is an isotype at the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew.\nOurisia simpsonii is morphologically similar to other New Zealand small-leaved species, namely O. sessilifolia, with which it shares the subrosette or rosette habit, ovate to very broadly ovate or obovate to very broadly obovate leaves, irregular white corollas, and having a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs on many plant parts.\nO. simpsonii can be distinguished from O. sessilifolia by irregular calyces (vs. regular), flowers and bracts in pairs only (vs. sometimes in whorls), glabrous and yellow corolla tubes (vs. 1 or 3 lines of hairs and purple), and long glandular hairs that are the same size as the non-glandular hairs (vs. glandular hairs that are much shorter than the non-glandular hairs).\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nOurisia simpsonii plants are perennial herbs. The stems are creeping, with opposite leaves that are opposite and tightly packed into rosettes or subrosettes. Leaf petioles are 3.3–17l3 mm long. Leaf blades are 6.8–30.4 mm long by 5.3–23.3 mm wide (length: width ratio 1.1–1.3: 1), ovate to very broadly ovate, or obovate to very broadly obovate, widest above or below the middle, with a rounded apex, cuneate base and regularly crenate edges. Leaves are densely hairy with a mixture of long glandular and non-glandular hairs on both surfaces, especially on the prominent veins on the lower surface, and punctate. Inflorescences are erect, with hairy racemes (sometimes densely hairy) up to 126 mm long, with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs, and with 1–3 flowering nodes and up to 5 total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node has 1–2 flowers and 2 sessile, sometimes clasping bracts that are narrowly to broadly obovate or oblanceolate. The lowest bracts are similar to the leaves, 7.5–11.4 mm long and 2.9–8.2 mm wide, and become smaller toward the apex of the raceme. The flowers are borne on a densely hairy pedicel that is up to 28.9 mm long and usually has a mixture of non-glandular and glandular hairs. The calyx is 5.7–8.7 mm long, irregular, with 3 lobes divided to one-third to one-half the length of the calyx and 2 divided to near the base, and often densely hairy with a mixture of glandular and non-glandular hairs. The corolla is 17.7–19.6 mm long (including the 4.9–11.7 mm long corolla tube), bilabiate, tubular-funnelform, glabrous and white to purplish on the outside, and glabrous and yellow on the inside. The corolla lobes are 5.4–11.3 mm long, spreading, and usually obovate and slightly emarginate. There are 4 stamens up to 9.2 mm long which are didynamous, with two long stamens reaching the corolla tube opening or exserted, and 2 short stamens included inside the corolla or reaching the corolla tube opening; a short staminode 0.3–1.3 mm long is also present. The style is 4.9–7.5 mm long, exserted or reaching the corolla tube opening, with an emarginate stigma. The ovary is 2.0–2.9 mm long and glabrous. Fruits are capsules c. 5.0 mm long and c. 4.3 mm wide with loculicidal dehiscence and pedicels up to 29.5 mm long. The number of seeds in each capsule is unknown, and seeds are 0.8–1.0 mm long and 0.5–0.7 mm long, with a two-layered, reticulate seed coat.\nOurisia simpsonii flowers from November to April and fruits from January to March.\n\nThe chromosome number of Ourisia simpsonii is 2n=48.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nOurisia simpsonii is a New Zealand mountain foxglove that is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand.  It is found only in the northwestern regions of the South Island, namely Western Nelson, Canterbury and Westland in high-elevation herbfields and grasslands on cliffs, crevices and rocky areas, from 1200 to 2300 m above sea level.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nAn individual of O. simpsonii was included in phylogenetic analyses of all species of the genus Ourisia using standard DNA sequencing markers (two nuclear ribosomal DNA markers and two chloroplast DNA regions) and morphological data. In all analyses, the sampled individual belonged to the highly supported New Zealand lineage, but its placement was not well resolved within that clade.\nIn another phylogenetic study using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), all 16 sampled individuals formed a highly supported clade that was placed with strong support near O. sessilifolia. The 16 sampled individuals of O. simpsonii also comprised one of the significant clusters in the Bayesian clustering analysis.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nOurisia simpsonii is listed as Not Threatened in the most recent assessment (2017–2018) of the New Zealand Threatened Classification for plants.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ourisia simpsonii at Wikimedia Commons\nOurisia simpsonii occurrence data from Australasian Virtual Herbarium",

The local Africans nickname him \"Mzungu,\" a racial slur for \"white man,\" because they believe he is a spoilt affluent man who has been accustomed to a luxurious American lifestyle. The difficult teachings that Ishmael must learn continue. He soon finds out that rape—even of children—is frequently ignored and that law and order in the densely populated Nairobi is, at best, patchy. Shaken by this deliberate blindness, Ishmael finds himself at odds with many in the community, including his new friend, the pot-smoking Detective David Odhiambo, after he rescues a young rape victim.\nHowever, not everything in Nairobi's settlement colonies is filthy and violent. Ishmael falls in love with Madeline, a former RPA member who was frequently sexually assaulted by \"genocidaires\" until she was saved by Hakizimana, the very activist Ishmael is attempting to clear of murder. Clever and courageous, Madeline tells the rape victim Ishmael has rescued, \"Sister, there are no second chances in this cruel country on cruel continent.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

It is believed that King Shreedhwaja Janaka had built a pond at the place where Goddess Sita was manifested, which later became famous as Urvija Kund.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAccording to Tribhuvan Dasji Maharaj, the chief priest of the Janaki temple at Janaki Sthan, the pond from where Goddess Janaki appeared is called Urvija Kund. There are two ponds in Sitamarhi, one is in Punaura Dham and the other is in Janaki Sthan. Both the ponds are sacred, one is the pond where Goddess Janaki was manifested and the other is the pond where Goddess Janaki was bathed. There is dispute and confusion between the two Kunds. According to some scholars, it is believed that Goddess Janaki appeared in the Urvija Kund of Janaki Sthan. Similarly, according to some other scholars, the Janaki Kund at Punaura Dham is the real Urvija Kund. But presently, the Kund at Janaki Sthan in the city of Sitamarhi is named and called as Urvija Kund. According to tradition, on the Vaishakh Shukla Shashthi, a 19 days Sitamarhi Dham Parikrama Yatra is started from Urvija Kund situated at Janaki Sthan with Janaki Doli, in which saints and devotees participate.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Savitri (Savi) Naipaul Akal (b. 1928) is a memoirist and former teacher from Trinidad. She is the daughter of author Seepersad Naipaul and his wife Droapatie (née Capildeo), and the sister of V. S. Naipaul and Shiva Naipaul.\n\n\n= Early Life and Education =\nSavitri (Savi) Naipaul Akal was born at the Lion House in Chaguanas, Trinidad, in April 1928. She is the fifth child and fourth daughter of Droapatie Naipaul (née Capildeo) and Seepersad Naipaul. \nThe Naipaul family lived for a time at Lion House (Anand Bhavan), the historic home of the Capildeo clan in Trinidad, before living at 26 Nepaul Street (now Naipaul House and Literary Museum). Both houses were memorialised in her brother V. S. Naipaul's novel A House for Mr Biswas, and would be revisited by Naipaul Akal in her memoir, The Naipauls of Nepaul Street.\nNaipaul Akal studied at Tranquillity Intermediate School and St. Joseph's Convent in Port of Spain. She obtained a BA degree partially from Edinburgh University in Scotland (1961–1963), and completed at the University of the West Indies at St. Augustine, Trinidad (1968). She followed this with a Diploma in Education in 1973.\n\n\n= Career =\nFrom 1968 to 1972, Naipaul Akal worked as a part-time tutor in sociology at the University of the West Indies at St. Augustine, Trinidad, followed by a full-time post as a teacher of Geography at the Convent schools and at Tranquillity. In 1980, she retired from the latter, having risen to Vice-Principal. Until recently she ran an up-scale boutique, Smaks, in Valsayn.\nIn 2018, Naipaul Akal published her memoir of the literary Naipaul family, The Naipauls of Nepaul Street (Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, 2018). Both she and her sister Kamla had wanted to write a memoir about the family and their time at 26 Nepaul Street (now Naipaul House and Literary Museum),  but Savi had deferred to her elder sister. When Kamla passed before she could accomplish it, Savi's surviving family encouraged her to write the memoir.\n\n\n== The Naipauls of Nepaul Street ==\nSavi Naipaul Akal's memoir tells of the Naipaul family's literary beginnings, their life at 42 Nepaul Street (now Naipaul House and Literary Museum), and the eventual emigrations and dispersals that led to the end of their time there. In the memoir, she tells the story of her parents, and their role in the large family of seven children.\nThe memoir is unique in expanding upon the lives of the Naipaul women, who were often overlooked in literary biographies until that point. Though the women of the Naipaul family were briefly given additional focus when Nicholas Laughlin added more correspondences to Letters between a Father and Son (as co-editor of its second edition), V. S. Naipaul later removed these letters and restored the earlier text for subsequent editions.\nNaipaul Akal writes of how her mother, Droapatie, managed the family's finances and ensured all seven children (including the five daughters) went to university. She also explains that V. S. used his mother as a source of information — via savage \"interrogations\" — to inform his own writing. The book also explores Droapatie's diplomatic handling of her husband's desire for independence — as well as his job as a reporter and his literary ambitions — against the demands of being a part of the large, high-profile Capildeo family.\nThe book also covers the time V. S. Naipaul was in Oxford, his \"war of words\" with their brother Shiva, and the surprise early deaths of their father Seepersad and then Shiva, too. Like Vidia's early work, she portrays a family encouraged by Seepersad's belief that books and literature would be a way to better themselves.\nWriting in the Trinidad Express, Bridget Brereton called the book \"lively\" and \"moving\", and said it was \"a valuable record of a remarkable family and a formative period in Trinidad's social and cultural evolution\". \nIn The Spectator, Patrick Skene-Catling describes Naipaul Akal herself as \"evidently ... sharply observant as well as affectionate\" and says she mostly maintains \"admirable moderation, balance and good humour\" on her subjects. On the subject of her brother V. S. Naipaul, however, he argues that Vidia's own work needs to be read alongside Savi's to offer some \"justification\" for the actions she criticises.\nSavi Naipaul Akal donated photographs to Naipaul House for its restoration as a museum. Her son, Ashvin, donated much of the museum's memorabilia and is the treasurer of the organisation charged with managing the museum, the Friends of Mr Biswas.\n\n\n= Personal life =\nSavi Naipaul Akal married into the Akal family. Her son Kiran has developed her former Valsayn-based boutique into an international tea and spirits brand, SMAKS Luxury Group. Her other son, Ashvin, is treasurer of the Friends of Mr Biswas — the group which manages Naipaul House and Literary Museum.\nNaipaul Akal has remained close with her brothers and sisters. Though V. S. Naipaul moved away at 18 and her brother Shiva died at the age of 40 — Naipaul Akal publicly lamented the \"war of words\" between them — she maintained communication with Vidia throughout his life and was on good terms with him when he passed.\n\n\n= References =",

        "content": "Soumaintrain is a French soft cheese made exclusively from whole cow's milk with a 21-day ripening period. It is named after the commune of Soumaintrain.\nA minimum of 75% of the dry food the cows consume must be from the geographic area.\nIt was proposed to be a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) cheese in 2014 and was finalized in 2016.\nSoumaintrain originates from north of Bourgogne where it borders the department of Aube. It is full of grasslands with wet valleys, which is conducive to dairy farming but discourages other agricultural pursuits. The soil is predominantly loose and impermeable clay and is difficult to cultivate with machines. The area has a topography that is largely flat with little undulation, with a dense hydrological network set among soft, impermeable rocks, which combines to create a susceptibility to flooding between autumn and spring. Temperatures are somewhat cool with an annual average that barely exceeds 10 °C. Rainfall is regularly between 700 and 800 mm.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe process of making Soumaintrain can be traced to the Middle Ages. The earliest evidence of ripened cheese dates back to a twelfth-century abbey in Pontigny which was founded in 1117. Henri Auclerc (1887–1968), a priest in Vergigny linked cheese-making and the abbey when he asserted that: ‘the Cistercian monks demanded payment of farm rents in ripened cheese’.\nThe traditional production method of Soumaintrain is described numerous times in nineteenth-century literature. Essentially, the fresh cheese curd is poured into moulds and allowed to drain. The cheese is turned twice daily for two days until fully set. After which it is salted on both sides and then washed daily until the outside develops its colour.\nWashing the cheese periodically removes surface flora which develops because of the prevalent humidity of the region. The specific technique used for washed-rind ripening combined with the fresh curd starter leads to the defining characteristics of Soumaintrain, a moist rind, a colour that ranges from ivory to pale yellow, centripetal ripening (the cheese ripens from the outside in, but rarely ripens to the centre), intense aroma and characteristic refined bitter aftertaste.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "ChaPanda (SEHK: 2555, Chinese: 茶百道; pinyin: Chá Bǎidào), also known as Chabaidao, in Chinese, is a tea beverage brand in the People's Republic of China. According to the official website of ChaPanda, there have been more than 5,000 stores nationwide since its establishment in 2008, and the brand has covered most cities across the country.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 2008 in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, by Wang Xiaokun, ChaPanda opened its first store under Chengdu ChaPanda Catering Management Co., Ltd., which was established on February 21, 2017.\nIn 2018, ChaPanda decided to revamp its image by introducing a cute and clumsy blue panda mascot named Ding Ding Cat, which incorporated Chinese elements. This move significantly boosted brand recognition, reaching approximately 800 stores by the end of the year. By the end of 2020, the number of ChaPanda stores had surpassed 3,000.\nDuring the pandemic, ChaPanda experienced a surge in growth, defying the overall market trend. In just nine months, the number of stores exceeded 3,000, making it a rising star in the tea beverage industry and earning it the nickname \"King of Delivery\".\nAccording to the \"National Meituan Takeout Sales\" ranking released in June 2021, ChaPanda ranked third with a total of 10.563 million orders for the month, trailing only Wallace and Mixue Ice Cream & Tea. However, ChaPanda's average sales per store exceeded 3,000 orders, significantly surpassing other brands.\nEarlier reports from Shanghai Securities Journal and other media outlets indicated that ChaPanda was planning an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong with a target of raising approximately $500 million. ChaPanda successfully completed its IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 15, 2023, and was successfully listed on April 23, 2024.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nHowever, in 2021, the company faced allegations of using expired raw materials. \nIn May, ChaPanda (Changsha Shiji Jinyuan Store) was exposed for allegedly using expired ingredients during a surprise inspection by the Market Supervision Bureau. Law enforcement officials found that the labels on raw materials named \"cake\" and \"raw coconut milk\" in the freezer had expired. On May 28, in response to this incident, ChaPanda issued a statement on its official Weibo account, stating that, upon learning of the matter, the company immediately organized a special investigation team to look into the store. The results are as follows: After investigation, the \"cake\" and \"raw coconut milk\" in question during the random inspection were not expired raw materials. Both raw materials were prepared on-site at the store, and due to staff negligence, the expiration date labels were not replaced in time after preparation, resulting in the expiration date labels showing as expired during the inspection.\nA blogger conducted undercover visits to four ChaPanda stores in different cities and discovered that all of them were using expired ingredients with replaced labels. The store employees claimed this was done to avoid detection by regulatory authorities. The topic \"ChaPanda uses expired raw materials\" became a trending topic on September 30, sparking widespread concern.\nOn 6 October, a female customer in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, reported finding a spider in the milk cap of a beverage ordered from a ChaPanda store in Cixi. The customer stated she had already reported the incident to relevant authorities. ChaPanda staff responded that no spiders were found during preparation, and the customer reported the issue hours after receiving the drink. The store is negotiating 600 yuan in compensation with the customer. The incident quickly became the top-trending topic on Weibo.\nIn the aftermath of Fat Cat's suicide, when people ordered fast food deliveries to commemorate him, multiple restaurants delivered empty packages, including ChaPanda. Upon realizing the issue, ChaPanda issued an apology. Additionally, both ChaPanda and Wallace announced the dismissal of the employees involved in the incident. ChaPanda also made a 1 million RMB donation to the Sichuan Youth Development Foundation in Fat Cat's name.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was based on a German play, with adaptation and music done by Charles Nagel.\nIt was one of the earliest locally written plays although the plot was set in Italy. The play was given a licence to be performed in Australia despite being an original work which was extremely rare The play was devised as a vehice for Josph Simmons.\nReviewing a performance the New South Wales Examiner said it \"took the andience by surprise, and brought\ndown a hearty and unrestrained effusion of merriment, such as the walls of the theatre have seldom witnessed.\"\nThe Sydney Herald said \"the dialogue is smart, some of the original music (composed by the author) is pretty, and on the whole the piece was suceessful.\"\nThe Australian said \"This species of entertainment is not now much in vogue, and without offending the squeamishness of any portion of our Colonial audience, we may say, that it is one to which they have not been sufficiently familiarized to be very competent critics. But all men, women, and children, know when they are\npleased, and the vast majority of such in the theatre, on Saturday night, expressed their pleasure in a manner that could not be mistaken for any thing else than the spontaneous effusion of their delight. \"\nThe Sydney Gazette said \"Great credit is, notwithstanding, due to the author, for the admiradle manner in which he has dramatised it.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Mock Catalani at AustLit\nThe Mock Catalani page at Australian Variety\nThe Mock Catalani at Ausstage",

        "content": "Porth Ruffydd Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station located at Porth Ruffydd on Holy Island, west of the port of Holyhead, Isle of Anglesey, Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1891.\nAfter 14 service launches, but with no lives saved, the station was closed in 1904.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn poor conditions on 17 December 1889, the Barque Tenby Castle ran aground on rocks at Penrhos Point, on the western side of Holy Island. The Volunteer Life Brigade was dispatched to travel 3 miles overland from Holyhead. The Holyhead lifeboat was launched, but needed to travel the 6 miles or more around the north of Holy Island. On arrival on scene, the brigade were unable to reach the vessel. John O Williams, Chief Officer of HM Coastguard, and Holyhead lifeboat Honorary Secretary, sent a man to also raise the Rhoscolyn lifeboat, 5 miles away.\nHowever, after several trips with the use of a small boat, the brigade managed to save 3 men. By the time the Holyhead lifeboat arrived, the vessel had sunk. They picked up one man, who later died. In all, 11 of the 14 crew of the Tenby Castle were lost. Five of the brigade received the RNLI Silver Medal for their brave efforts.\nAs a result, it was decided to open a lifeboat station at nearby Porth Ruffydd. A 34-foot 10-oared self-righting pulling and sailing (P&S) lifeboat (one with oars and sails), costing £436, was ordered from Watkins & Co., and a boathouse, costing a further £1,320, was constructed at the head of the small cove. A special fund had been raised by a Mr and Mrs Norbury of Bowden, and this covered the entire cost. Such was the remote location of the station, the station was managed by Holyhead lifeboat station, as if the boat was required, many of the crew would be Holyhead men.\nAt a ceremony in Holyhead on 6 August 1891, Mrs Norbury named the lifeboat Norbury (ON 297).\nThe Porth Ruffydd lifeboat was first called on the 19 November 1893 to the SS Theresa, but it turned out she was not required. On 12 October 1894, the lifeboat was called to aid the Norwegian vessel Eugenie aground on Ramon Rocks, and after some assistance. she was refloated. \nWith few service calls, and now with a steam-powered lifeboat based at Holyhead, able to cover the distance far quicker than before,  it was decided to close the Porth Ruffydd Station in 1904. The Norbury (ON 297), the only lifeboat to serve at Porth Ruffydd, was broken up. The boathouse survived until 1997, when it was demolished. Only the steps down to the old station remain, as pictured.\n\n\n== Porth Ruffydd lifeboat ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The magazine is known for its support for the Clarté-ideology.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nL’Art libre was established in Brussels in 1919. Paul Colin was the founder and editor-in-chief of the magazine. Its editorial board included both Dutch- and French-speaking individuals. The magazine was published in French on a biweekly basis.\nL’Art libre was one of the mouthpieces of the Clarté movement founded by Paul Vaillant-Couturier in France and had an internationalist stance. It frequently featured the French translations of the literary work by international authors. In the early 1920 the magazine published three essays by Ezra Pound.\nL’Art libre folded in June 1922. Its successor was the Europe magazine which was started immediately after the closure of L’Art libre.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"L'Art libre\".

        "content": "Alice Leal Guo (born 1986) is a Filipino  politician who has served as the mayor of the municipality of Bamban, Tarlac, since 2022. The first woman to serve as the town's mayor, Guo was alleged by Senator Risa Hontiveros to have links to illegal Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGO) following the 2023 and 2024 raids in Bamban. Hontiveros urged the Philippine government to investigate Guo's early life and educational background.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDetails of Guo's early life and educational background are disputed. Guo states that she was born inside her home in 1986 to a Filipino-Chinese father whose birth certificate was subsequently found to have listed him as a Filipino named Angelito Guo, while his business documents listed him as a Chinese national named Jian Zhong Guo. Guo has also stated that her family raised pigs for a living and that she grew up on a farm. An archived post on the official website of the Bamban reveals Guo extending birthday greetings to Patty, whom she refers to as her mother. Observers have noted a perceived lack of resemblance between them.\nAccounts suggest she received homeschooling, a fact disclosed during a joint Philippine Senate Committee investigation. However, her birth was only registered when she was 17 years old. This delay cast doubts on her early life, given the absence of hospital birth records and her inability to identify her homeschool provider. The absence of traditional educational records prompted inquiries into the nature of her early education. No publicly accessible information exists about Guo's higher education, including whether she pursued college or any other form of tertiary education.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 2022, Guo was elected as the municipal mayor of Bamban, Tarlac, with 16,503 votes against the 16,035 votes received by her closest rival, Joey Salting Jr. She ran for office as an independent candidate but acknowledged receiving support from the \"previous administration\".\n\n\n== Alleged links to POGOs ==\nSenator Win Gatchalian revealed Guo's alleged links with the firm Zun Yuan Technology, Inc., an online casino firm which was registered in the Philippines as a Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO). Prior to her election in 2022, Guo had applied for the license of Hongsheng Gaming Technology, Inc; and in late 2020, the municipal council approved its establishment and operation. Hongsheng had its license to operate canceled by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) by 2022.\nThe POGO hub, situated in the property which is owned by Baofu Land Development, Inc. and is located behind the municipal building in Barangay Anupul, Bamban, was twice raided by the authorities: in February 2023, for alleged involvement in cryptocurrency investment scams; and in March 2024, due to allegations of human trafficking and other cybercrimes; at that time, it had been renamed Zun Yuan.\nIn May 2024, during a Senate inquiry, senators said that the POGO compound housed \"mercenaries\" allegedly involved in cybercrimes and surveillance activities, citing intelligence reports. Meanwhile, Guo contradicted allegations against her, stating that she was the former landowner of the property, and her vehicle, found within the compound, was sold in 2020. Guo admitted that being one of the incorporators of Baofu, but said that she later sold her shares upon entering politics.\nDuring the inquiry, Senator Risa Hontiveros floated an idea that Guo may be a Chinese \"asset\" trained to infiltrate the Philippine government and \"have an influence in Philippine politics\". Guo expressed dismay saying that she had been \"judged prematurely\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

His grandfather received the title of \"tú tài\" in the examinations three times and later took part in the Cần Vương movement.\nIn 1912, at the age of 21, Ngại passed the Imperial examination at the Thừa Thiên Examination Field and received the rank of Cử nhân. After that, Ngại enrolled in Hậu Bổ school of Huế and where he met Ngô Đình Diệm, the future President of the Republic of Vietnam.

        "content": "The Hypersonic Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) is a satellite-based sensor system being developed by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) along with the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) to address hypersonic threats. The product of the 2019 Missile Defense Review's (MDR) for further enhancement of the US national missile defense system, the HBTSS will provide quality intercept data to the GPI. Equipped with \"Birth-to-death\" capability, the HBTSS can track potential threats from their launch until interception. The HBTSS will ultimately be integrated into the broader set of satellite constellations being developed by the Space Development Agency (SDA).\nThe new satellite architecture itself, dubbed the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), will consist of seven layers: data tracking, transport, custody, battle management, navigation, deterrence, and support. The HBTSS will be a part of the tracking layer, whose goal is to \"provide global indications, warning, tracking, and targeting of advanced missile threats, including hypersonic missile systems.\" It will work alongside SDA-developed Wide Field of View (WFoV) satellites with its Medium Field of View (MFoV) with the WFoVs cueing data to the HBTSS which will then provide more specific and quality target data, referred to as \"fire control data,\" to linked ground-based interceptors. This combination of both MFoVs and WFoVs are crucial as normal radars may miss fast-moving advanced missile technologies such as the Russian-made Avangard and Chinese-made Starry Sky-2, which are Hypersonic Glide Vehicles (HGVs).\nThe current phase of the HBTSS program is in protype stage and lacks operational capability. The HBTSS program plans to launch two demonstration sensors into orbit by Fiscal Year (FY) 2023. The Missile Defense Agency have selected two military contractors - L3Harris Technologies and Northrop Grumman - to design, build, and lastly demonstrate prototype satellites for the HBTSS in January 2021. Both were awarded with contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. By December 2021, these prototype satellites had passed critical design reviews, meaning manufacturing can move forward. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Shavkat Galievich Shayakhmedov (Russian: Шавкат Галиевич Шаяхмедов; 1960 – May 23, 2023), known as The Zalegoshchensky Maniac (Russian: Залегощенский маньяк), was an Uzbekistani-Russian serial killer and rapist who committed at least five murders in Tajikistan and Russia from 1994 to 2021, four of which were children. Convicted for his four known murders in the latter country, he was given a life term and died behind bars in 2023.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nLittle is known about Shayakhmedov's early life, aside from the fact that he was born in 1960 and hails from Uygur, a village in the Uzbek SSR's Andijan Region. He would later claim that he was sexually abused by one of his relatives, but this was never corroborated.\nAfter graduating from a vocational school, Shayakhmedov was drafted into the Soviet Army in the early 1980s. Upon completing his service in the mid-1980s, he moved to Istiqlol in the Tajik SSR, where he soon married a local woman who would give birth to twins—a son named Roman and a daughter named Ruzilya—on September 29, 1988. Shayakhmedov would claim later on that he had to move away from his native village after ethnic Uzbeks demanded that he learn their language or be forced out.\n\n\n=== Move to Russia ===\nIn the mid-1990s, Shayakhmedov and his family left Tajikistan and headed for Russia, where he found accommodation in Kazar, Oryol Oblast. Soon afterwards, he found a job as a mechanic for local enterprises, due to which he gained a reputation as a hard worker. Since the work was difficult but well paid, Shayakhmedov eventually gathered enough money to buy his own house in the village sometime in the mid-2000s.\nIn contrast to his financial success, Shayakhmedov's reputation as a person was met with mixed feelings from locals. On one hand, he was noted for never having a criminal record, but on the other, he was known to frequently drink alcohol and smoke marijuana, which eventually led to his own children developing the same addiction as him. Most alarmingly, he was suspected of physically and sexually abusing his daughter, as she was never allowed to leave the house after graduating school and was forbidden from going to university, leading to several suicide attempts in the early 2010s. Despite these claims, his wife claimed that Shayakhmedov had no negative influence on his children and constantly made excuses about his questionable behavior and actions.\nOn June 1, 2013, Shayakhmedov's son Roman died of a heart attack at age 25, having drunk a large quantity of alcohol mixed with coffee on the day of his death. Three months later, Ruzilya died from complications brought on from cirrhosis. Shayakhmedov would claim in a later interview that he would frequently experience nightmares in which his deceased children would call out to him.\nShortly after their deaths, Shayakhmedov quit his high-paying job and instead began working as a plumber at the Zalegoshchenskaya Secondary General Education School No. 2, where he was regarded positively by school administration. During his stay there, he also gained popularity with the students, as he often treated them to cigarettes and sweets. In the late 2010s, he was accused of sexual harassment by several female students, one of whom claimed that he had taken her behind a wooden toilet on the school grounds and started touching her intimate parts, but she managed to break free and inform her classmates and acquaintances. Despite the gravity of the accusations, the students' claims were largely ignored.\n\n\n== Murders ==\nThe first murder that has been conclusively linked to Shayakhmedov that was committed in Russia occurred in April 2000, when he raped and strangled a 6-year-old boy in Zalegoshch. After killing him, he dumped the boy's body in a nearby ravine.\nIn September 2003, Shayakhmedov went out fishing and came across a 32-year-old woman who was visiting acquaintances in Kazar. Taking advantage of the fact that she was asleep and drunk, he attacked and subsequently raped her. Fearing that she would somehow remember his face if left alive, he then strangled her and dumped the body on the outskirts of the village near a railroad bridge, where it was discovered a few days later.\nOn July 27, 2005, 11-year-old Konstantin Bolotov left his grandmother's house in Kazar to go for a bike ride but failed to return home. A few days later, his bike was found by a local resident named Anatoly Abashin, who for some time was considered the prime suspect in the boy's disappearance, but no charges were ever brought against him. Aside from Abashin, several other suspects were considered, including some workers from the Rostov Oblast who were working on a road surface in the area. Local police theorized that Bolotov was killed by accident and then the workers rolled his corpse in asphalt, but no evidence corroborated this theory.\nOn the day Bolotov disappeared, his neighbor Shayakhmedov invited the young boy to help pick mushrooms. After luring Bolotov to a forest outside the village of Orekhovka, Shayakhmedov proceeded to attack and rape him, ultimately strangling the boy to death after he threatened to tell his grandmother. In order to hide the body, he dug up a shallow grave and buried it there. It was only after Shayakhmedov's arrest, and only after the investigation unit had to dig up almost 3 hectares, that his skeletonized remains and decaying clothing were located.\nOn June 18, 2021, Shayakhmedov committed his last murder, with the victim being another neighbor, 9-year-old Viktoria Gnedova. On the day of the murder, she went to his basement and demanded that Shayakhmedov buy a motorcycle that he had promised to give her, but he refused; instead, he grabbed a nearby hammer and hit her several times on the head, killing her. Investigators suspected that this occurred after Gnedova threatened to tell her parents about the sexual abuse she had experienced at Shayakhmedov's hands on previous occasions; he initially denied this but later admitted that it was exactly the case.\n\n\n=== Search for Gnedova and investigation ===\nShortly after Gnedova's disappearance, Governor Andrey Klychkov launched a campaign to locate the young girl, appealing to residents across Oryol Oblast, the neighboring regions, and social media to help in the search. Thousands of concerned citizens from Kursk, Tambov, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Tula, and Moscow Oblasts volunteered for the campaign, in addition to local and regional security personnel. During the search, wells, landfills, basements, outhouses, forest belts, and a number of industrial enterprises were inspected, with a sugar factory near Kazar pumping out its tanks full of raw material to rule out an accident. A number of reservoirs and bodies of water were also inspected by diving teams, but this also yielded no results. Eventually, the case was handed over to Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the Investigative Committee of Russia. According to Armen Yeghiazaryan, the Deputy Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, law enforcement worked tirelessly to pursue any and all leads, especially those concerning former convicts who had committed sexual offenses.\nIn August, a tablet was found in the bushes near the apartment building where Viktoria Gnedova lived. Realizing that it belonged to the girl, it was immediately checked for fingerprints, with forensic scientists discovering that while there were no usable fingerprints, there was DNA from Viktoria and her family members, as well as that of their upstairs neighbor, Shavkat Shayakhmedov. He was soon brought in for interrogation, but he claimed to have an alibi for the day of the crime, claiming that he was at work at the time. A check of the timesheets revealed that he had indeed been at school at the time, but a number of schoolchildren and locals soon came forward to testify against Shayakhmedov, revealing that many of them had seen him wandering the streets and buying sweets from the grocery store.\nFrom these interviews, two sisters would come forward, claiming that they had been abused as minors by Shayakhmedov, placing the date of the attack somewhere between August 10 and 31, 2005. According to them, Shayakhmedov had come to visit their father, with the two men drinking until late in the night. Once their father fell asleep, Shayakhmedov burst into their room and sexually assaulted both of the victims, who were aged 7 and 9, respectively. They claimed that they never informed anyone about the crime until now because they feared the publicity and the possibility that they would be unable to confirm that a rape had actually occurred.\n\n\n== Arrest, trial and sentence ==\nBased on the sisters' testimony, Shayakhmedov was arrested on August 26, 2021, and a criminal case was opened against him. A few days later, unable to withstand pressure from the investigators, he confessed to the murder of Gnedova and offered to show law enforcement where he buried the body. On September 15, her remains were exhumed in the place indicated by Shayakhmedov, with DNA tests conclusively proving that the remains belonged to Gnedova.\nOlga Martynova, Gnedova's mother, would later reveal that she and her husband were the initial prime suspects in the disappearance, alleging that investigators had attempted to bribe her into confessing just to see what her reaction would be. After Shayakhmedov's arrest, she described his demeanor as completely calm, appearing to be unfazed by the fact that he had violated and murdered a little girl.\nIn order to get rid of the body, he buried the young girl's body in a corner of the cellar underneath her parents' apartment. To do so, he dug a tunnel under the foundation of the load-bearing wall of the structure, in which he placed the corpse, almost completely obscuring it from view aside from her feet, which were hidden by laying ceramic tiles. After this, Shayakhmedov filled the remaining holes with construction material and various garbage to cover them up. While a search operation was conducted by police officers, including in the basement, the probe was unable to detect traces of the body due to the ceramic tiles, from which the search initially had no results.\nIn late September, Shayakhmedov was charged with Gnedova's murder. Only a few days later, he unexpectedly confessed to three more murders for which he had never been considered a suspect, as well as the rapes of three underage girls committed between 2005 and 2018. His confessions proved to consist of knowledge only the perpetrator could have, and in November, all the subsequent criminal cases were merged into one big trial. Per the indictment, Shayakhmedov faced multiple charges of murder, rape, child sexual abuse, and a myriad of related charges.\nThe trial officially began on October 25, 2022, and was held behind closed doors. In it, Shayakhmedov's lawyer, Yulia Olenicheva, insisted on his innocence, claiming that her client had been beaten up by investigators and pressured into confessing. To back up her claims, she presented photographs and medical reports, which showed that Shayakhmedov suffered numerous bruises and hematomas inflicted by blunt objects during his stay in the detention center. No explanation was given about the origin of the bruises.\nDespite this, on December 22, Shayakhmedov was convicted on the four murder and rape charges, fully admitting his guilt in spite of his lawyer's protests. As he suffered a stroke during the investigation and was partially paralyzed, he appeared at court hearings in a wheelchair. A week after his conviction, Shayakhmedov was sentenced to life imprisonment.\nFollowing the conclusion of the trial, the victims' relatives attempted to have Shayakhmedov's wife prosecuted as well, as they believed that she was aware of her husband's crimes and never reported him to the police. Martynova claimed that sometime after her daughter went missing, she overheard an argument between the Shayakhmedovs in which the wife supposedly said that she had helped him avoid arrest even before they moved to Russia, implying that he had committed other crimes.\n\n\n== New confessions and death ==\nIn early 2023, Shayakhmedov was transported to the Mordovian Zone to serve out his sentence, but shortly after his arrival, he unexpectedly confessed to a fifth murder, which he claimed took place in Tajikistan in 1994. According to him, on May 21, 1994, he killed 8-year-old Katya Dmitrieva in Istiqlol, where he lived with his family at the time. The girl was last seen alive in the afternoon in her family's yard on Stroiteley Street, and upon realizing she was gone, her parents organized a large-scale search with the help of volunteers but were unable to find the girl. Shayakhmedov stated that he lured Dmitrieva to his garage, where he raped and strangled her. He then transported the body via motorcycle to his mother-in-law's house on 19 Kamoli Khujandi Street, where he buried her under the house's foundation in a similar manner to the later murder of Gnedova.\nOn May 23, 2023, Shayakhmedov died from health complications brought on by his stroke. His family and relatives refused to claim his body, and he was thus buried in a grave next to the Mordovian Zone.\n\n\n=== Search and potential further victims ===\nFollowing Shayakhmedov's death, representatives of Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs and the General Prosecutor's Office in Tajikistan traveled to Istiqlol in the summer of 2023, where they unearthed skeletal remains at the indicated place. The entire process was recorded by Tajikistani security services, and subsequent DNA examinations confirmed that the skeletal remains belonged to Dmitrieva. With his guilt conclusively proven in this crime, rumors began to spread that Shayakhmedov possibly might have killed other victims during the Soviet years, while he lived in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. It was also speculated that he frequently moved to avoid arrest if crimes were linked back to him.\nAside from this, Shayakhmedov confessed to a fifth murder that took place in Russia shortly before his death, with the victim being a child that was killed somewhere within the city of Oryol. As of October 2023, the investigation into this supposed victim is still ongoing.\n\n\n== In media and culture ==\nIn May 2023, the Russia-24 channel aired a program titled \"On the Trail of the Beast\" (Russian: По следу зверя), which covered the Shayakhmedov case and even featured an interview he gave to reporters detailing his life and the circumstances of his crimes. At the end of the interview, Shayakhmedov stated that what he had done was unforgivable and that he fully agreed with the sentence handed down to him.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Russian serial killers\nList of serial killers active in the 2020s\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cycles of Trying to Cope is the sixth studio album by American metalcore band Like Moths to Flames. It was released on May 10, 2024, through UNFD. The album was produced by Carson Slovak and Grant McFarland. It is the band's first album to feature drummer Roman Garcia and guitarist Cody Cavanaugh.\n\n\n== Background and promotion ==\nOn February 7, 2024, the band released two new singles \"Paradigm Trigger\" and \"Angels Weep\" with a corresponding music video for \"Paradigm Trigger\". On March 7, the band unveiled the third single \"Kintsugi\" along with a music video. At the same time, they announced the album itself and the release date, while also revealing the album cover and the track list. On April 11, the band premiered the fourth single \"Dissociative Being\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe album received positive reviews from critics. Anne Erickson from Blabbermouth.net gave the album 8 out of 10 and said: \"Like Moths to Flames are absolutely triumphant on The Cycles of Trying to Cope, and it should be well-received by new and old fans alike. Next time around, it would be nice to see this band dip into more experimentation, as they certainly have the talent to branch out. But, for now, The Cycles of Trying to Cope is more than worthy of repeat listens.\" Katie Bird of Distorted Sound scored the album 8 out of 10 and said: \"Overall, The Cycles of Trying to Cope is cohesive, fun to listen to, and accessible to new fans. Whilst it isn't perfect, as some of the songs in the middle suffer from production issues, the rest of the album is a masterclass in how to balance two genres at once. By scattering elements of electronica throughout the first three songs, for example, it does not feel out of place for the fourth song to have a heavy electronic metal sound. By doing this throughout the album, the band make sure that the genre changes do not sound sudden. The instruments and vocals throughout are fantastic, and the pacing is – mostly – cohesive, and all told this makes for a brilliant addition to the band's discography.\"\nNew Transcendence praised the album saying, \"I was astounded, and continue to be astounded at The Cycles of Trying to Cope. A record I expected to enjoy I've ended up loving, and while there may be one or two songs that fall just flat of the heights set by \"Kintsugi\", \"Gone Without a Trace\" and \"What Do We See When We Leave This Place?\" They are by no means slouches. Like Moths to Flames' sixth full-length record is their finest, and a contender for one of 2024's apex metalcore records with precious little in the way of tangible flaws. It remains to be seen how Like Moths to Flames come to terms with trying to cope, but I can only hope they have cycles of churning out more records like this long into the future.\" Samantha Andujar from Spill gave the album almost a perfect score 4.5/5 and saying: \"The Cycles of Trying to Cope addresses these issues by bringing together these complex emotions and various musical threads to create not just one of their finest records to date, but also a fantastic concept album.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nLike Moths to Flames\n\nChris Roetter – lead vocals\nZach Pishney – lead guitar\nCody Cavanaugh – rhythm guitar\nRoman Garcia – drums, percussion\nAdditional personnel\n\nCarson Slovak – production, mixing, mastering\nGrant McFarland – production, mixing, mastering\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Qatari Almanac (Arabic: التقويم القطري, romanized: al-Taqwīm al-Qaṭari) was an annual almanac authored by religious scholar Sheikh Abdullah Ibrahim Al-Ansari that integrated traditional and astronomical knowledge, offering invaluable insights into prayer timings, seasonal weather patterns, and local celestial navigation across the Persian Gulf region. Following his father's legacy, Al-Ansari published the almanac since 1957–58, incorporating knowledge from ancient Arabic texts and almanacs, including one from 1906 by Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah Al-Uyuni of Al Hasa, which he republished in 1960 under Emir Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani's sponsorship. It was the most widely disseminated almanac among the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. In 1966, the almanac was formally declared as the official calendar of Qatar by Emir Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani.\nThe Qatari Almanac integrated formal astronomical knowledge with local time-keeping systems. It featured charts detailing the zodiacal months, lunar stations, planets, the lunar Hijri and Christian solar calendars, shadow lengths for calculating prayer times, and the navigational system based on Canopus, among other data. It also offered insights into the distances between Doha and other Qatari towns in kilometers and included poetry and sayings reflecting traditional knowledge of environmental shifts with each season.\n\n\n== History ==\nSheikh Abdullah Ibrahim Al-Ansari was born in Qatar in 1919. After initially making a career of pearl hunting, Al-Ansari received a religious education in Saudi Arabia before returning to his home country and establishing the first religious institute in 1954. He was later given a governmental position, being named the Director of the Office for the Revival of Islamic Heritage. He showed a great interest in the Islamic calendar and time-keeping systems, and in 1957–58, took over the publication of the Qatari Almanac from his father Ibrahim Al-Ansari. The almanac would continue being regularly published on an annual basis until Sheikh Al-Ansari died in 1989.\nAccording to researcher Daniel Varisco in 1990, \"[...] the Qatari Almanac has become a standard source for much of the Gulf. Indeed, it is difficult to find an informant in Qatar who is not familiar with the almanac.\" Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Al-Ansari published specialized almanacs for Mecca, Medina and the capital cities of the Persian Gulf countries.\nFollowing Al-Ansari's death in 1989, his son, Mohammed bin Abdullah Al-Ansari, took over the publication of the Qatari Almanac. He also established the Qatari Calendar House in 1990. In more recent times, the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs has assumed control of the Qatari Almanac's publication.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nAl-Ansari's work not only aligned the Hijri calendar with the zodiac but also preserved a treasure trove of star lore dating back to the pre-Islamic period in the Arabian Peninsula, encapsulated in a genre known as anwa. One of the seminal texts in this tradition was the Kitab al-Anwa' by Ibn Qutayba, who provided extensive descriptions of Arabic star names, traditional meteorological beliefs, and seasonal characteristics.\nMost importantly, the almanac chronicled the practical use of shadow lengths to determine prayer times before the advent of modern clocks, a method still observable in many older mosques. The almanac also described local seasonal terminologies and the significant navigational and pastoral practices dictated by the stars, such as the rising of Canopus marking the onset of autumn rains and pastoral migrations. Al-Ansari notes six separate seasons, each spanning two months in length: wasmi (corresponding to autumn rains), shita (winter), rabi (winter to spring), sayf (spring), hamim (early summer), and khareef (late summer to early autumn). Al-Ansari's method of classifying the seasons soon became commonplace, appearing in Saudi Arabian and other Arab almanacs.\nAs modern methods of timekeeping became more prevalent, the almanac was made redundant.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Sheikh Abdullah Al Ansari Complex for the Holy Quran and Science was opened over a 5,000 square meter area in Hazm Al Markhiya, Doha in 2014. Containing many religious and literary works, the complex hosts the Qatari Calendar House, the Center for Islamic Studies, and the Sheikh Al-Ansari Library.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "George W. Kirkman (February 26, 1867 – November 14, 1951) was a thrice-court-martialed U.S. Army officer. In later life Kirkman became an amateur historian of Los Angeles County, California, publishing articles about the pre-statehood and military history of the region.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGeorge Wycherly Kirkman was born in 1867 in Texas, the son of Joel T. Kirkman and Lucy Frances Walker. United States Military Academy Cadet Kirkman was first court-martialed, on charges of drunkenness, in 1887. He was initially to be dismissed but authorities intervened and he was sentenced to four months \"in the light prison\" instead. His Cullum number is 3319. According to the Kansas City Star, Kirkman entered West Point \"in 1884 and was graduated class of 1889. He was commissioned second lieutenant, First Infantry, June 12 in that year and joined for duty in California.\" His first service was at Angel Island. In 1895 he was married at Benicia Barracks in California to Grace Goodyear. According to a history of the Goodyear family published by Grace Goodyear Kirkman in 1899: \n\nHe served in the Sioux Indian campaign, in South Dakota, from Nov., 1890, to April, 1891, and organized, equipped and drilled troop G, Ogalalla Sioux Scouts, for service in that war. Served in command of a detachment on a Southern Pacific train during the Great Strike of 1894...[he] was stationed at Fort Russell, Wyoming, until outbreak of Spanish-American War. Served throughout war in command of Co. C, 8th U.S. Infantry, in Cuba, his record at El Caney being briefly given in the following extract from the official report of his battalion commander:\n\"My battalion at El Caney had the greatest per cent. of killed and wounded, from our being only four or five hundred yards from the enemy, under a deadly fire, for seven hours, a fire more dangerous than any I experienced in the Civil War.\nIn recommending that First Lieutenant George W. Kirkman be granted the brevet of Major, for distinguished gallantry on the field of battle, I deem it only what is due him. In order to get to his position, he made a charge over an open field, in which there was not the slightest bit of cover, and advancing further than any other Company, brought his men up to within three hundred yards of the enemy's forts, leading his men with great gallantry.\nIn this charge he lost eleven men killed and wounded, and sustained during the day a loss of seventeen men out of thirty of his command. He firmly held his position, personally bandaging and caring for his wounded men throughout the day, with no assistance from the medical corps.\nWhen a battalion of another Regiment came up behind us, and fired into us, it was he who went up in front of them and stopped the firing. It is no more than justice that Lieutenant Kirkman should be breveted Major, and I respectfully urge that it be done.\n[Signed]:\nE. B. SAVAGE,\nMajor Eighth Infantry.\"\n\nAfter the battle of El Caney, Lieutenant Kirkman remained in command of his Company through the siege and surrender of Santiago.\"\nOn the way to duty on the Philippine Islands he insulted the papal emissary Archbishop Chapelle to such an extent that Kirkland was arrested and court-martialed. Kirkman had apparently been drunk. He was dismissed from the Army as a result of his conviction, but Senator Hawley successfully pushed for his reinstatement. Around the same time he was also under investigation for unpaid bills due to creditors in Manila.  \n\nIn 1904 Kirkman was wanted for questioning about some bad checks, and shortly thereafter he was arrested for being AWOL. According to the Baltimore Sun, \"About a month after Captain Kirkman's arrest in Baltimore, Brig.-Gen. Frederick D. Grant preferred charges against him alleging that the Captain had been absent from his command without leave since September 23. At the time it was stated in the dispatch from Washington that bills for hundreds of dollars for furniture, said to have been destroyed by Captain Kirkman in a New York hotel, had been received at army headquarters.\" He was court-martialed again, and convicted on 31 counts. He spent roughly three years in Fort Leavenworth, primarily as penalty for misconduct charges involving the suicide of a fellow officer's wife. Meanwhile, the Kirkman marriage produced two children but ended in divorce; Grace Goodyear Kirkman died in 1909 and her sister requested custody of the children.  \n\nIn 1916 Kirkman was remanded to the Cook County Insane Asylum, in part due to excessive alcohol consumption. Kirkman remarried in Los Angeles in 1926, to Cora E. Curtis. Kirkman became an amateur California historian in the 1920s and 1930s, writing long articles for the Los Angeles Times about the rancho era and the pre-settlement Tongva village Yangna, and producing a well-regarded historical map of Los Angeles County. Kirkman died of acute bronchitis and senile emphysema in California in 1951. He was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nKirkman's first wife, Grace Goodyear Kirkman, was editor of the Benecia New Era newspaper prior to her death at Adams Springs at age 40. Kirkman's son Goodyear Kirkman was a naval aviator in the United States Marine Corps. According to the USMC Archives, which has a photo album from his time in that service, \"Goodyear Wycherly Kirkman was born in Florida in 1896. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and, after a brief stint as a Sergeant, was released from his enlisted duties. By June of 1919, Kirkman had been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Aviation section and was stationed at Marine Flying Field, Miami. He was very successful in this relatively new form of warfare, even praised by his brigade commander for his skill and heroism in flying through a stormy night to deliver medicine to a critically ill patient. In 1924, Kirkman was arrested on the charges of drunkenness and of disrespect, and by 1925 he was discharged.\"\nKirkman's half-brother Hugh Tecumseh Kirkman was twice charged with embezzling from the Army. Hugh T. Kirkman was incarcerated at Leavenworth in 1906 and the brothers served time there simultaneously until 1907. Their father, Joel T. Kirkman, was also court-martialed at one time on charges involving another officer's wife. The father retired as a colonel in 1902, after a long career of service, beginning during the American Civil War and continuing for many decades in the regular army. Joel T. Kirkman had three brothers: one was killed by guerrillas around Memphis during the Civil War, one worked for the Freedmen's Bureau in Texas after the war, and the third became a railroad executive with Chicago Northwestern Railroad.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlcoholism in family systems\n\n\n== References ==",

The nearest higher neighbor is Lost Mountain one mile (1.6 km) to the north. Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into the Oak Creek watershed. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 1,570 feet (479 meters) above Boynton Canyon in one-half mile (0.8 km). Bear Mountain is composed of light-colored Coconino Sandstone overlaying reddish Schnebly Hill Formation. The mountain's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Bear Mountain is located in a temperate semi-arid climate zone. Hikers can expect afternoon rain and lightning from the seasonal monsoon in late July and August.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountain peaks of Arizona\n Mountains portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nBear Mountain Trail No. 54: US Forest Service\nBear Mountain Trail Forest Service photos: Flickr",

        "content": "Adolf Schults (5 June 1820 – 2 April 1858) was a German poet.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSchults was born in Elberfeld, Germany on 5 June 1820 to parents of \"little financial means\". His father was a foreman in a silk goods factory, while his more-educated mother came from a French family. After leaving school before reaching the secondary level, he entered his father's business. After marrying in 1843, he left this business six months after his father was forced to resign.\nHe was a deputy editor of the Barmer Zeitung newspaper for a time, but left it sometime before 1848.\nHe mainly worked as an accountant while writing poetry in his free time, in a situation similar to his childhood friend Friedrich Roeber.\nSchults became known primarily for his lyrical works. Among his most famous poems, some of which also contained sociopolitical themes, is the satirical parody Ein neues Lied von den Webern (A New Song of the Weavers), written in response to Heinrich Heine's 1844 poem The Silesian Weavers. Also frequently cited today is his Mother's Day poem Das Mutterauge (Mother's Eye).\nHe was a member of the Wuppertal poets' circle (Wuppertaler Dichterkreis) in the early 1850s. In Schults' estate, the historian Michael Knieriem found the fragment of a drama by Friedrich Engels, entitled Cola di Rienzi. Schults also wrote a poem about Engels in 1848/49.\nHe died on 2 April 1858 in Elberfeld—reportedly \"excessive work, especially at night time, increased his nervousness and ultimately led to the uncanny chest pain [Brustleiden] to which he succumbed\".\n\n\n== Works ==\n— (1843).

        "content": "On 11 October 1987, a Fokker F27 operated by Burma Airways crashed while en route to Pagan from Rangoon, Burma. The regularly scheduled domestic flight was carrying 49 passengers and crew. The aircraft struck a hillside south of Nyaung U Airport, killing everyone on board. It was the second fatal crash involving Burma Airways in four months.\n\n\n== Aircraft and flight ==\nThe accident aircraft was a Fokker F27 Friendship powered by two Rolls-Royce Dart 532-7R turboprop engines. It was manufactured in 1985 with the serial number XY-AEL. Prior to the crash, it had 3,958 of flight hours across 3,799 flights.\nThe routinely scheduled domestic flight from Rangoon to Pagan covered a distance of about 300 mi (480 km). On the day of the crash, the plane carried 4 crew and 45 passengers. Among the 36 foreign nationals on board 14 were Americans; 7 Swiss, 5 British, 4 Australians, 3 Germans, 2 French and 1 Thai. Thirteen occupants, including the crew, and a baby, were Burmese nationals. Of the 12 American victims identified, least eight were residents of California; 2 each from New Orleans and Santa Fe.\n\n\n== Accident ==\nAbout 10 minutes before the plane was expected to land, radio communication with the tower ceased. The plane crashed into a ridge at an altitude of 1,500 ft (460 m) during its approach to Nyaung U Airport about 32 kilometres (20 mi) away. At the time, visibility was low due to heavy monsoon rain. Everyone on board was killed. According to a Rangoon radio report, the crash occurred after an in-flight fire near the village of Phanaung, while other news agencies said they could not establish if the fire occurred before or after the plane crashed. It was the second fatal crash involving Burma Airways in 1987; on 21 June, another Fokker F27 crashed after departing Heho, killing all 45 on board.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe accident aircraft's next scheduled destination after landing at Pagan was Mandalay. After it crashed, passengers expecting the flight traveled to the city via buses.\nA spokesperson for the United States Department of State citing a Burmese investigation team at the crash site said there was \"no evidence of an in-flight explosion, fire or sabotage.\" She added that the likely cause was a stall from attempting to land too early, and the pilots attempted to recover from but the aircraft lost power and crashed.\nDue to the crash occurring outside the city area, accessibility was difficult as local residents reached the crash site before the police. The local residents began looting. The local police brough the bodies to the airport. According to an official at the United States Embassy in Rangoon, the bodies were in poor condition, most decapitated or had lost their hands, making identification difficult. The bodies of all 49 on board were retrieved, and a flight was arranged to transport the remains back to Rangoon on 12 October.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "While many sports have historically had homophobia run deep within them at many levels, Australian rules football has been a particular point of scrutiny by LGBT advocates. The Australian Football League (AFL) is one of the rare fully professional leagues to have no active—or even retired—players to publicly identify as gay or bisexual despite more than a century of elite competition and at least 16,885 players in the VFL/AFL, although multiple players at an amateur level or semi-professional level have come out (specifically, many players in AFL Women's have come out as gay or bisexual).\nPlayers at non-professional level have come out, including Jason Ball, and he launched a campaign to tackle homophobia in Australian rules football. However, the first player to come out to the public was a man named Matt Hall, who contracted HIV in 1996 and was banned from the Victorian Amateur Football Association due to his diagnosis. Hall came out in 2002 and actively worked to fight the stigma until his sudden death in 2023.\nWhile no gay or bisexual professional players have come out, former AFL coach and premiership player Danielle Laidley (formerly known as Dean Laidley) was outed without her permission by a police officer in May 2020 for being transgender; the police officer in question was stood down. The outing occurred after Laidley was arrested and charged with one count of stalking. She did not apply for bail. She was allegedly found with 0.43 grams of methamphetamine in her bra at the time of her arrest. A Victoria Police officer distributed photos of Laidley in women's clothing taken while she was in custody. In December, the officer was charged with unauthorised access and disclosure of police information as well as misconduct in public office. Three other officers were accused of the same breach. In November 2020, Laidley was placed into a diversion program and given an \"adjourned undertaking with no conviction recorded\" on the stalking charge.\nBesides members of the LGBT community, controversy has arisen as former players such as Jason Akermanis—while not homophobic himself—controversially advised in a 2006 article that gay and bisexual players should keep their sexual orientation secret, which ended his career at Brisbane; he doubled down on this stance in 2023.\nIn more recent times, the AFL has taken a strong stance against homophobia, including publicly supporting the Yes vote for marriage equality, including temporarily changing its logo to \"YES\" in support. The survey was ultimately successful in overturning Australia's marriage laws, with more than 61% of respondents voting in the affirmative.\nThe AFL took a particularly strong stance against homophobic slurs in the 2024 AFL season, handing out significant suspensions to players who have used such language. Gold Coast defender Wil Powell was suspended for five games after making a homophobic slur against a Brisbane player in round eight. This came just a month after Port Adelaide's Jeremy Finlayson received a three-game ban for a similar incident against Essendon. The AFL escalated the penalty for Powell to send a clear message that homophobic language will not be tolerated, with general counsel Stephen Meade stating: \"homophobia has no place in our game, nor in society.\"\nMelbourne captain Max Gawn called it \"embarrassing to call yourself an AFL player\" in 2024 after multiple incidents in the year, supporting the league's tough stance. The AFL Players' Association, however, criticized what it sees as inconsistent sanctions and called for a review of the processes. Earlier in the 2024 season, North Melbourne coach Alastair Clarkson was fined A$20,000 for an alleged homophobic comment towards two St Kilda players. The incidents have highlighted the AFL's efforts to create a welcoming environment for the LGBT community. Clubs have condemned the language and vowed to provide education to players.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHomosexuality in association football\nHomosexuality in American football\nHomosexuality in modern sports\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Overwatch Champions Series (OWCS) is a global competitive esports tournament series for the video game Overwatch 2, owned by Blizzard Entertainment. The circuit is divided into three regions: North America; Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa (EMEA); and Asia. The North America and EMEA regions are operated by ESL FaceIt Group, while Asia is by operated by Korean esports tournament organizer WDG.\n\n\n== History ==\nOverwatch initially showed promise for an esports scene during its beta phase in 2015, attracting teams from around the world to compete upon its full release. While an open ecosystem for its esport was quickly established, its publisher Activision Blizzard elected to create the Overwatch League, a franchised league akin to that of North America's NBA, with slots being sold for a reported US$20 million for its inaugural season in 2018. The league faced challenges early on, including a slow start in its inaugural years and logistical issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Additionally, the announcement of Overwatch 2 in 2019 brought about changes to the game's format and gameplay, which received a lukewarm response upon release in 2022. These challenges, coupled with controversies such as the sexual harassment lawsuit in 2021, led to mounting pressure from teams to exit the league. Months before Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, teams were offered the chance to leave the Overwatch League, ultimately leading to its closure in January 2024.\nThe Overwatch Champions series (OWCS) was established in January 2024 following the folding of Overwatch League. Unlike the previous approach of independently managing the league, Blizzard Entertainment opted for partnerships to oversee specific regions, with ESL FaceIt Group operating the North America and EMEA regions, while WDG was selected to operate the Asia region. The Overwatch Champions Series adopted open format, departing from the franchise structure of the Overwatch League. This transition opened up opportunities for both established organizations and new entrants, with teams like ENCE and Team Falcons joining the series well-established teams such as Fnatic and TSM. Former Overwatch League teams such as the Toronto Defiant also remained active after the closure of the Overwatch League, competing with a new roster in the OWCS. Early concerns for OWCS included the lack of well-defined prize pools, the lack of a clear roadmap, and challenges in maintaining consistent viewership, compared to that of the Overwatch League.\n\n\n== 2024 season ==\n\n\n=== Format ===\nThe OWCS follows an open tournament format, allowing any team to compete in open qualifiers that lead into regional and international tournaments. The OWCS is divided into three regions: North America (NA); Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa (EMEA); and Asia. Both North America and EMEA follow the same format structure, with Asia following a different structure due to its size. The 2024 season has two international events: the Dallas Major, which will take place in June 2024, and the Stockholm Finals, which takes place at the end of the season.\nThe Asia region has two competitive stages and is further divided into three subregions: South Korea, Japan, and Pacific. Stage 1 begins with each subregion hosting its respective Open Qualifiers, which then feed into Regional Tournaments. From there, the top teams from each region advance to the OWCS Asia Championship, an eight-team event held at the WDG Esports Studio. Qualification from this championship secures slots in the Dallas Major at DreamHack. Stage 2 mirrors Stage 1's format, with top performers advancing to the Stockholm Finals.\nFor North America and EMEA, the OWCS consists of four stages. Each stage comprises three phases: Swiss, Groups, and the Main Event. The Swiss phase accommodates up to 512 teams, with the top 16 proceeding to the Group stage. From there, teams compete in groups of four, with the top two from each group advancing to the Main Event – an eight-team, double-elimination tournament. Circuit points are awarded to top finishers in the Main Event, determining qualification for international tournaments. Stages 1 and 2 lead into the Dallas Major, while Stages 3 and 4 lead into the Stockholm Finals.\n\n\n=== Broadcast ===\nFor the 2024 season, OWCS matches are broadcast across various platforms. In North America and Europe, matches are broadcast on YouTube and Twitch. In Asia, the broadcast is available on platforms such as YouTube, CHZZK, AfreecaTV (Korean), and Twitch (WDG and PlayOverwatchJP for Japanese audiences). Viewers can earn exclusive in-game rewards, such as OWCS-themed cosmetics, through Twitch Drops during official match streams.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n2024 OWCS Rulebook",

        "content": "Bianca Babb (August 26, 1856 – April 13, 1950) was an American pioneer woman and former captive of the Comanche people. As a child, she was taken captive during a Comanche raid on her family's homestead in Wise County, Texas in 1866. Babb spent seven months living among the Comanches before being ransomed and returned to her father in 1867. She later wrote a memoir that provided a rare first-person account from the perspective of a young female captive, offering insights into Comanche culture and life on the Southern Plains frontier of the late 19th century.\n\n\n== Early Life and capture ==\nBianca Babb, originally named Bianca Louella and also known as Bankuella, Bianca Babb Bell, or simply Banc, was born on August 26, 1856, during her family's journey from Wisconsin to Texas, in a covered wagon near Lecompton, Kansas. Her parents, John S. Babb and Isabel A. Babb, were settlers and ranchers.\nIn her formative years, Bianca resided with her family in a cabin near present-day Chico, Wise County, Texas. The region, situated on the outskirts of non-Native American settlements, was often fraught with tensions and conflicts between settlers and indigenous tribes, particularly the Comanche people who dominated the area.\nThe Babb family experienced tragedy on September 14, 1866, when a band of Nokoni Comanches, led by Persummy, raided their cabin. Bianca's father and eldest brother were away at the time, leaving her mother, Isabel Babb, and Bianca herself, along with her siblings, vulnerable to the attack. Isabel Babb lost her life, while Bianca, along with her brother Theodore Adolphus (\"Dot\") and a young houseguest named Sarah Jane Luster, were captured by the Comanches.\n\n\n== Captivity among the comanches ==\nAfter the young houseguest escaped with Dot's help, prompting respect from the Comanches when the siblings defied execution, Bianca was separated from her brother. The warrior Kerno who captured her gave Bianca as a foster daughter to his widowed sister Tekwashana. For seven months in 1866–1867, Bianca lived immersed in traditional Comanche society, learning skills like camp setup, swimming, and cultural practices like ear-piercing from her adoptive mother. Tekwashana also darkened Bianca's blonde hair. The band followed a nomadic lifestyle, frequently relocating camps across the Oklahoma-Texas panhandle region, allowing Bianca to experience the daily routines, customs, and way of life among the Comanches firsthand.\n\n\n== Ransom and return ==\nAfter Bianca's capture, her father John Babb joined efforts by frontiersmen and Native allies to search for his missing children. Around April 1867, Jacob J. Sturm, a civilian agent from Fort Arbuckle, located Bianca and secured her ransom and release from the Comanches for US$333 (roughly $7,259 today). Sturm then brought Bianca to the fort. Despite her months living with the tribe, Bianca returned willingly to her family. In June 1867, her brother Dot was also ransomed for US$210 (roughly US$4,578 today), with articles of clothing worth US$23.75, and released back to their father.\n\n\n== Later years and memoir ==\nThe Babbs initially relocated to Reedsburg, Wisconsin after the ordeal, though Bianca later returned to Texas in 1881. On June 25, 1882, she married Jefferson Davis Bell, an abstractor of land titles. Bianca attributed her wanderlust and frequent family relocations between various North Texas towns like Henrietta, Denton, Greenville, as well as periods in California and New Mexico, to her nomadic experiences living with the Comanches.\nFrom 1897 to 1900, the former Kiowa-Comanche-Apache reservation lands were divided into household allotments. As a former adoptee, Bianca filed a claim seeking her own allotment and restitution for losses in the 1866 raid, including her mother's death. Though she revisited the reservation and had supportive testimonies from Comanche friends, her allotment claim was rejected.\nIn the 1920s, Bianca wrote an unpublished memoir manuscript recounting her seven months living among the Comanches as a child captive. While circulated in typescript form, it did not receive wide publication during her lifetime.\n\n\n== Reception of memoir ==\nBianca Babb's unpublished memoir manuscript has received scholarly attention as a significant primary source captivity narrative. While the captivity narrative was a popular literary genre in 19th century America, many examples were sensationalized accounts of questionable authenticity. In contrast, Babb's work is viewed by researchers as a credible and insightful first-person perspective.\nThe memoir provides one of the few detailed accounts from the viewpoint of a juvenile female captive adopted into a Plains Indian tribe, differing from the predominant narratives focused on adolescent male captive experiences assimilating into warrior cultures. Babb's recollections center on intimate depictions of domestic life, material culture, and survival skills learned while immersed in traditional Comanche society.\nHaving acquired fluency in the Comanche language during childhood, Babb demonstrated an ethnographic eye for cultural details in her descriptions of practices like kinship systems, religious ceremonies, and subsistence activities. Scholars have corroborated many of her observations against other historical and anthropological sources from this era.\n\n\n== Later life and legacy ==\nUnlike her brother Theodore \"Dot\" Babb who published his own memoirs to fame, Bianca did not widely publicize her remarkable childhood experiences living among the Comanches when interviewed by journalists later in life. She was widowed in 1934 after over 50 years of marriage. Bianca Babb died on April 13, 1950, in Denton, Texas at age 93, recognized as the final surviving American to have been adopted into a Plains Indian tribe as a child captive.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nGelo, Daniel J.

In addition to the standard episodes hosted by celebrity guests and featuring musical acts, the series will also have several months of acknowledgements, leading to a three-hour celebratory special retrospective in February 2025.\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn late 2021, long-time producer Lorne Michaels stated that he was committed to continuing on the series through the fiftieth season (it was then on 47) and suggested that he may retire afterward. The subsequent year, Kenan Thompson speculated that the series may end if Michaels left, saying, \"He's the one that's had his touch on the whole thing... It opens the opportunity for a lot of bullshit to come into the game because he's such a legend that he keeps off those corporate wolves\". During Saturday Night Live season 49, Michaels suggested that 2000s-era member Tina Fey could take over, but insisted that he would finish the next season before any dramatic changes. He reiterated these plans in May, when a 50th anniversary special was announced that would celebrate the series' history on February 16, 2025. Prior to the season start around October 2024, NBC will begin retrospectives on the show with their mid-year coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics and Michaels intends to bring back everyone from the previous decades as well as hosts and a variety of musical guests who have helped shape the show.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSNL Star Kenan Thompson on Season 50 Hype, Bridging Demographics at Bleeding Cool",

        "content": "Jackey Jackey the NSW Bushranger is a 1852 Australian play by James McLachlin about the bushranger William Westwood known as \"Jackey Jackey\" (not the Aboriginal tracker of the same name.) He wrote it in collaboration with Thomas McCombie, after having successfully adapted McCombie's Arabin; or, The Adventures of a Settler.\nThe play was based on McCombie's piece on Jackey Jackey, published in Tait's Edinburgh Magazine in 1844. \nThe play was written that year in Melbourne and submitted for approval to the Colonial Secretary in Sydney for permission to be produced at the Queen's Theatre in Melbourne. This permission was refused on the grounds the play might encourage disrespect for authority, the reasons being \"dramas of analogous character have been prohibited from representation in the United Kingdom, and there are obvious reasons, why the principle which renders them objectionable there should apply with even greater force here.”  \nHowever the play was eventually produced in Melbourne in 1852 after Victoria separated from New South Wales. It was then shown in Geelong in 1853. Author Margaret Williams wrote this marked \"a turning-point for the bushranger as protagonist after a decade of censorship.\" \nWhen the play was produced in 1852 it was advertised as a new drama by McLaughlin. McCombie wrote a letter of complaint to the newspaper stating:\n\nThe drama which was licensed by the Colonial Secretary was \"Jackey Jackey, dramatized by J. R. McLaughlin, from the work of Thomas McCombie Esq.\" and as considerable portions of the drama are almost verbatim from my book, and as I contributed several songs, in order to advance the success of the piece, I leave the public to judge of the motives which could have actuated the manager in thus completely altering the title of the play as licensed. I, however, completely exonerate Mr McLaughlin from, any participation in this fraud, for I know that, he is incapable of being guilty of such conduct; and I have heard that he handed the piece over to the Manager as it was licensed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n1845 piece by McCombie on Jackey Jackey",

Held on 10 May 2024 at the Suheim bin Hamad Stadium, it was the third leg of the 2024 Diamond League – the highest level international track and field circuit. Beginning in 2024, it was sponsored by Seashore Group.\nThe meeting was highlighted by world leads from Kenny Bednarek and Alison Dos Santos, who ran the fastest 400 metres hurdles time set before June of any year. Some non-Diamond League events also served as the West Asian Athletics Championships for 2024.\n\n\n== Results ==\nAthletes competing in the Diamond League disciplines earned extra compensation and points which went towards qualifying for the 2024 Diamond League finals. First place earned 8 points, with each step down in place earning one less point than the previous, until no points are awarded in 9th place or lower. In the case of a tie, each tying athlete earns the full amount of points for the place.\n\n\n=== Diamond Discipline ===\n\n\n=== Promotional Events ===\n\n\n=== U20 Events ===\n\n\n=== West Asian Champs ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Diamond League\n\n\n== References ==\n\nResults\n\"2024 Doha Diamond League Results\".

The religious complex also served as a burial ground for relatives of the rulers of the Mataram Sultanate, which ruled Java from 1586 to 1749.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally, seven Muslim tombs were discovered at the site. These tombs belonged to religious men who spread Islam in West Kalimantan in the 14th century. The current gravestones in the two mausoleums date back to the 15th century, however. Years later, the Sultans of Mataram would bury their relatives in the cemetery around both mausoleums. The religious complex is still a place for ziyarat, with visits by both locals and tourists.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe religious complex comprises two mausoleums and a cemetery.\n\n\n=== The mausoleums ===\n\nThe larger mausoleum, which is 240 m2 in area, is the main buildings and it contains five tombs. Two of the tombs, which date to 1441 and 1437 CE respectively, have Javanese inscriptions on their grave markers. All the tombs are made out of carved andesite.\nThe smaller mausoleum, which is 48 m2 in area, contains only two tombs. One of the tombs is inscribed with year 1365 of the Balinese saka calendar.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nIslam in Indonesia\nMakam Papan Tinggi\nList of mausoleums in Indonesia\n\n\n== References ==",

Just as code-oriented programming divides paradigms into imperative and declarative, and other sub-groups from there, so data-oriented programming groups its paradigms by the data structures they prioritize.\n\n\n== Categorization by data structure ==\nThe sub-groups are similar to the list of database models. The difference is that that list refers to database engines, whereas this is about the languages used; the languages used may or may not be part of a database engine, and one engine may support multiple models.\nSome of the sub-groups are:\n\nTable-oriented programming (TOP) languages, including relational database languages such as SQL,  spreadsheet languages, and general-purpose TOP languages\nGraph query languages, such as Gremlin, and RDF query languages such as SPARQL\nKey-Value based languages, such as MUMPS, Caché ObjectScript\n\n\n== Other ways of categorization ==\nData-centric programming languages are a subset of data-oriented programming; they:\n\nAre typically declarative\nAre typically dataflow-oriented\nTypically live in a data processing engine\nSeem to be Domain-specific languages, rather than general-purpose languages with data-processing features.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Njono or Njono Prawiro (new spelling: Nyono, August 28, 1925 – October 1968) was a labor activist and member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). Njono was known as the Secretary-General and Chairman of the Central All-Indonesian Workers Organization (SOBSI) and a member of the Politburo of the PKI Central Committee who got involved in the September 30 Movement. Previously, Njono was a member of the Indonesian Labor Party (PBI) and served as its interim chairman.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNjono was born in Cilacap 28 August 1925. He was the eldest son of Sastrodiredjo, a railway employee. In 1931, Njono studied at the Sekolah Rakjat (People's School) of Taman Siswa (Taman Muda) and completed it in 1938. He then continued to Taman Guru Muda but did not finish. He then worked as a young journalist at the Asia Raya newspaper in Jakarta during the Japanese occupation.\n\n\n== Early political career ==\nIn the early period of independence, Njono served as a member of the Working Body of Central Indonesian National Djakarta Raya (Greater Jakarta) and concurrently as a member of the Central Indonesian National Committee. Njono also led the Tram Workers Union in Kramat before joining the Indonesian Labor Brigade (BBI) and becoming the leader of the Jakarta branch of BBI. Njono was then elected as the interim chairman of the Indonesian Labor Party (PBI) on 26 July 1946, replacing Sjamsu Harja Udaja, who was arrested after the failed July 1946 coup, with Setyadjit Soegondo as the interim deputy. In November 1946, as part of the negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia leading up to the Linggarjati Agreement, various subcommittees were formed on the suggestion of the joint commission for civil affairs. Njono became a member of the labor affairs subcommittee.\nTo address the party's deteriorating condition, Njono held a party conference in Solo on 5 October 1946 to carry out \"self-correction, selection, and centralization\" by changing the party's direction to a more moderate stance in order to attract broader support from various differences of workers. Policy statements asserting that the party adhered to Marxism–Leninism principles and addressing class conflict were removed. Based on the results of the PBI Congress in Malang on 6 April 1947, Njono was elected as vice-chairman, while Setyadjit became the party's chairman.\n\n\n== SOBSI ==\nNjono became the Secretary General of SOBSI in November 1946. He served as the head of the SOBSI delegation for the 2nd WFTU Conference in Beijing and departed on 5 January 1950. Njono then became the chairman of SOBSI upon his return from the visit on 19 November.  Furthermore, Njono was also appointed as the Vice President of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) since 1953.\nUnder his leadership, SOBSI became increasingly dominated by the PKI, a process that began in late October 1949 when SOBSI resumed its activities after being halted due to the Madiun Affair. By mid-1951, almost all SOBSI members were subject to the leadership of the PKI. The unions under its umbrella also became increasingly dominated or influenced by the PKI.\nIn September 1960, Njono proposed the establishment of workers' councils in every state-owned enterprise with the status of advisory bodies for \"all matters.\" This proposal emerged as an effort by SOBSI cadres to dominate the economic field and provide communist unions with a counterbalance capable of improving the welfare of their members. Therefore, this proposal was immediately supported by communist-affiliated organizations. The government implemented this proposal, but the cadres from labor and peasant unions only served as advisors without having any control over production management, which was far from what SOBSI had hoped for.\n\n\n== Member of PKI ==\nDespite having a close relationship with D.N. Aidit and often being considered to have been a member of the PKI for a long time, Njono officially applied to join the PKI in December 1954. He was elected as a member of the DPR, representing the PKI in 1955. Njono was then inaugurated as a candidate member of the Politburo as a result of the Sixth National Congress of the PKI held on 7–14 September 1959 and officially became a member of the Politburo in February 1963. Njono also became the chairman of the PKI's Greater Jakarta Regional Committee (CDB) in September 1964. Hence, he resigned as Chairman of the National Council of SOBSI.\n\n\n== Involvement in the G30S ==\nNjono played a role in dividing Jakarta into six sectors, where civilian volunteers were prepared as reserves to carry out operations in each sector. Most of the volunteers came from the People's Youth and had received military training at Lubang Buaya. However, only the Gambir sector carried out the task of occupying the Telecommunications Building (now Telkom STO Gambir Building).\nAdditionally, he organized a network consisting of various posts, probably located in members' homes or party offices. These posts would be manned by PKI members at the Section Committee (CS) level, who were instructed to remain vigilant and continuously listen to the radio during the action. Njono planned to mobilize them to hold demonstrations if the movement could endure longer.\n\n\n== Death ==\nDue to his involvement in the September 30 Movement, Njono was arrested by the military on October 3, 1965. On February 14, 1966, Njono faced trial at the Bappenas Building in Menteng and was sentenced to death on February 21 through a verdict of the Extraordinary Military Tribunal (Mahmilub). Njono was eventually executed in October 1968.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNjono had one daughter as his only child and a wife who was also detained since October 1965 at Bukit Duri Prison, before being transferred to Plantungan Camp in April 1971. As his death approached, Njono wrote three poems, one of which was addressed to the family he would leave behind.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliographies ==\n\"Gerakan 30 September\" Dihadapan Mahmilub I: Perkara Njono.

The play was part of the realist drama tradition in Australian theatre at the time.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nVariety said Pullan \"has not mastered stage technique.\"\nThe Bulletin said Pullan \"tells us nothing more than we  have come to expect from the pen of the typical honest, observant pressman. Like him he never really succeeds in getting behind the headlines, but he has raised  \na burning social issue from the printed column to the stage.\" \nA copy of the play is at the Fryer Library, the University of Queensland.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nA girl runs away from a happy home and becomes involved with bodgies.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Johann Friedrich Gerhard Roeber (19 June 1819 – 12 October 1901) was a German writer and historian who participated in literary circles in Elberfeld and Wuppertal, in Germany.\n\n\n== Life ==\nJohann Friedrich Gerhard Roeber was born on 19 June 1819 in Elberfeld, Germany—the son of a woodturner, he attended the Elberfeld secondary school. In 1834, he began an apprenticeship at the Bankhaus von der Heydt-Kersten & Söhne (a credit bank). There he became a clerk, received power of attorney, and in 1872 became a partner. He left the company in 1879 and moved to Düsseldorf in 1894.\nIn the early 1840s, he participated in an Elberfeld literary circle, which included, among others, Adolf Schults, Carl de Haas, and Friedrich Engels. He later distanced himself from Engels, in 1886. In 1847, he married Maria Wilhelmine Elise (née Kretzmann). At this time, he became known as a playwright, novelist, and historian.\nRoeber served as the Procurator for Elberfeld at some point.\nIn the early 1850s, Roeber was a member of the Wuppertal poets' circle (Wuppertaler Dichterkreis). When this dissolved, a Sunday circle (Sonntagskränzchen) was formed, meeting at Roeber's house and consisting of poetry recitations, music and discussions—the formation of which was described by Carl Siebel in a letter to Wolfgang Müller von Königswinter in June 1853:\n\nThe founding of a poets' association [Dichtervereins] has recently been projected by Roeber, Schults, and myself—starting from the idea that all elasticity of the mind is formed purely through the exchange of ideas—we planned to meet every 4 weeks or 14 days to discuss set topics. Each person should draw their acquaintances as corresponding members, thus aiming for the greatest possible expansion gradually.\nBetween 1860 and 1864, he distinguished himself with publications in the literary journal Morgenblatt für gebildete Leser.  A year and a half before his death, Roeber suffered a stroke. In a moment of mental confusion, he burned numerous letters from Schults and de Haas to him.\nHe died on 12 October 1901 in Düsseldorf. Five years after his death, a monument was erected to him on Carnapsplatz in the Elberfeld Nordstadt (later destroyed in World War II). Another monument was erected in Düsseldorf by Karl Janssen.\n\nThe painters Ernst Roeber and Fritz Roeber were his sons.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n— (1856). Tristan und Isolde.

        "content": "\"Mestaniak\" which translates to ″Waiting for You″ in English,(Egyptian Arabic: مستنياك; also transliterated as Mestaniyak, Ana Fi Intizarak, or إنني أنتظرك) is a popular Egyptian song by Aziza Jalal. It was released in January 1983 by Alam El Phan Records.\n\n\n== Composition and legacy ==\nThe song \"Mestaniak\" is one of the most famous Arabic songs. It was sung by the iconic Moroccan singer Aziza Jalal after the release of \"Howa El Hobi Liaba\". It was recorded in Cairo, Egypt, in 1983, two years before the retirement of Aziza Jalal known as the Lady of Tarab or The Tarab ambassador of Arab music or the Angelic Voice of Arabic Music. At 26 years old, she retired at the height of her fame and position on the throne of Arab music in the early 1980s.\nThe song \"Mestaniak\" is written by Abdul Wahab Muhammad and composed by musician Baligh Hamdi  on Maqam Rast.,. Maqam Rast is the main maqam in the Rast Family, and by far one of the most popular and common maqamat in the Arabic repertory. Its scale starts with the root Jins Rast on the tonic, followed on the 5th degree by either Jins Upper Rast (with its tonic up on the 8th degree) or Jins Nahawand. \n\nThe song \"Mestaniak\" was produced by Alam El Phan. Aziza Jalal recorded the song \"Mestaniak\" with Al-Firqa al-Masiya, led by the great Egyptian maestro Ahmed Fouad Hassan and under the lead of the icon Egyptian musician Baligh Hamdi.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe official music video for \"Mestaniak\", produced by Alam El Phan, features Aziza Jalal in a studio as a singer on stage while wearing a glowing and magnificent dress robe soirée.\n\n\n== Aziza Jalal's Mestaniak Chart performance ==\nThe song \"Mestaniak\" remained on the top of the charts on many Arab TV and radio stations for many years . \"Mestaniak\" was a commercial success, topping the record charts and Alam Al Fan Company has also sold millions of copies of the song by the diva Aziza Jalal., \n\n\n== \"Mestaniak\" Aziza Jalal Song and Live Performances ==\nIn 1985, Ms. Aziza Jalal,\n, recorded the song \"Waiting for You\" during a live concert at the Zamalek Club in Cairo, Egypt, accompanied by the most famous Arab orchestra, Al-Firqa al-Masiya, led by the great Egyptian maestro and musician Ahmed Fouad Hassan.\nAziza Jalal, who has kept a low profile for more than 30 years, rekindled emotions as generations were enchanted by her voice and songs.\nShe thanked her fans “for coming to see me after a long hiatus. I’ve never been away from you, you have always been in my heart. I'm back today because of your love for me. I decided to come back to participate in these joyful events in our country.”\nDuring the concert, Aziza Jalal performed \"Mestaniak\" which the audience enjoyed immensely.\n\n\n== Different versions of \"Mestaniak\" song ==\nMany Arab artists have sung the song \"Mastaniak\" at their concerts and artistic gatherings.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPop Culture in North Africa and the Middle East: Entertainment and Society around the World, by Andrew Hammond, Series: Entertainment and Society around the World, 2017 - 319 pages.

        "content": "Sugar Bun Corporation Berhad, doing business as SugarBun is a Malaysian-owned chain of quick-service restaurants that originated in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia. Founded in 1978, it initially operated as an ice cream parlor before transitioning into the fast food industry. While its primary presence is in Sarawak, it also has locations in other Malaysian states, as well as in Brunei and Bangladesh.\nThe menu at SugarBun features a variety of dishes, including fried broasted chicken, savory rice and fish burgers, which have become popular among patrons. In addition to its classic offerings, SugarBun incorporates local Sarawakian and Bornean culinary traditions into its menu, catering to a diverse range of tastes and preferences.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early origin ===\nFounded in 1978 near the Kenyalang Theatre in Kuching, Sarawak, SugarBun originated as an ice cream and snack parlor established by Mr. Wung, an entrepreneur. Influenced by a memorable phrase he encountered during a trip to Taiwan, he named it SugarBun, thus initiating the establishment of the brand.\n\n\n=== Cultural shift ===\nIn the 1980s, while Sarawak had limited fast food options, SugarBun seized the opportunity presented by the local population's growing fascination with contemporary dining experiences, particularly those centered around chicken-based dishes.\nIn the absence of fast food restaurants during that time, Sarawakians' exposure to global culinary trends was primarily through advertisements from international chains like KFC and McDonald's broadcast on the radio stations. Despite the absence of fast food establishments, these promotions piqued the residents curiosity about the concept, laying the groundwork for future developments.\n\n\n=== Innovation ===\nResponding to consumer preferences within two to three years of its inception, SugarBun introduced broasted chicken as a key menu item. This innovative dish, cooked using advanced roasting fryers that combined deep frying and pressure cooking methods, quickly gained popularity with its unique Sarawak pepper-infused flavor.\nThe incorporation of this cutting-edge fryer technology was notably made possible by an American associate who introduced Mr. Wung to the equipment during a visit to the United States. Following this introduction, Mr. Wung successfully acquired the fryer, signifying a notable advancement in SugarBun's culinary offerings and capabilities.\nIn 1981, SugarBun reached a notable milestone as it entered the fast food sector by launching a new venue. At the forefront of this initiative was SB Chicken, positioned as the flagship offering. This expansion represented a significant step forward for SugarBun, enhancing its presence in the fast food market while providing a foundation for further growth.\nFurthermore, Wung's brother introduced an innovative recipe for SugarBun's savory rice, a menu offering that has sustained its popularity throughout the years. Another notable addition during the early stages of SugarBun's establishment was the Hoki fish burger, originally from New Zealand. This fish burger quickly became a signature item on SugarBun's menu.\nBy 1991–1992, there was a noticeable shift in consumer preferences, marked by a surge in demand for chicken dishes. During this period, SugarBun saw a notable increase in business, which mirrored a shifting preference among Sarawakians towards dining establishments that provided freshly prepared meals with minimal oil content.\n\n\n=== Transition and expansion ===\n\nA pivotal moment in the history of SugarBun took place in 1993 when the ownership underwent a transition to new shareholders. This transition occurred alongside a significant milestone for the brand, as it had already established 12 restaurants by that time. This change in ownership marked a crucial juncture in SugarBun's journey, signaling both growth and evolution as it continued to expand its presence in the market.\nIn 1997, SugarBun's parent company, Borneo Oil, reached a notable achievement by being listed on the Second Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).  This event not only reinforced SugarBun's position within the industry but also paved the way for potential opportunities.\nThe year 2001 marked another crucial phase for SugarBun with the introduction of a revamped menu featuring a diverse range of Asian dishes. This menu transformation encompassed additions such as Chicken Mushroom Soup, Sambal Eco Fish, Assam Eco Fish, Nasi Lemak and Chicken Curry, complementing the existing favorites. The introduction of these new offerings not only led to a notable surge in sales but also fostered greater customer engagement with the brand.\nDuring this period, numerous SugarBun outlets were strategically co-located with Applebee's Bakery and Caprilla Ice Cream Cafés, providing customers with a multifaceted dining experience all under one roof. This innovative approach aimed to offer patrons a diverse range of culinary options in a convenient setting. However, despite the success of these co-branded ventures, both Applebee's Bakery and Caprilla Ice Cream Cafés ceased operations by 2005 and have remained inactive since then.\nIn 2003, SugarBun had established a presence in over 50 restaurants domestically and abroad. This figure increased to 61 by 2012, with 53 establishments situated in Malaysia, six in Brunei, and one each in Bangladesh and China.\n\n\n=== Innovative concepts and continued growth ===\n\nSugarBun introduced its inaugural Drive-Thru concept in Malaysia with the launch of SugarBun located at Ulu Oya, Sibu in February 2015. This establishment, spanning two floors and occupying 9,333 square feet, marks the 59th addition to SugarBun's chain of restaurants in Sarawak.\nIn 2016, SugarBun introduced \"SugarBun - Borneo Asian Food\" in Kuala Lumpur, presenting a novel multi-stall concept aimed at enhancing efficiency and reducing service times. This initiative, available in selected outlets, offered patrons a taste of iconic dishes originating from East Malaysia, highlighting the region's unique flavors and culinary traditions. This innovative approach underscored SugarBun's aspiration to promote Malaysian Borneo cuisines on a broader scale.\nMoreover, several SugarBun branches throughout Malaysia have adopted a co-branding approach with Pezzo, a major pizza establishment from Singapore. These brands are affiliated as sister companies under Borneo Oil in Malaysia. This collaborative endeavor sees them operating together from shared premises, reintroducing the concept of co-location in many of their outlets.\nAdditionally, in 2016, SugarBun's total number rose to 84, with two located in the Klang Valley, eight in Brunei, one in Bangladesh and another in Melbourne, Australia. This expansion continued in 2019, reaching a total of 87 outlets.\nSugarBun unveiled \"Broasted by SugarBun\" in 2017, marking its debut location in Gambang, Pahang. This innovative food kiosk adopted the Grab-n-Go model, with the goal of simplifying the SugarBun dining experience and offering convenient access to its signature offerings in a streamlined format. It has since been rebranded as \"Broasted Chicken & Fish by SugarBun\".\nBy 2023, SugarBun's steady growth trajectory brought its network close to reaching 100 outlets, marking a significant milestone in its expansion journey. This achievement underscored the notable progress and success of the company's growth strategy.\n\n\n== Menu and products ==\n\nThe restaurant provides a varied menu to accommodate a broad customer base, from casual fast food to traditional comfort meals. Its production facility, situated in Kota Padawan, Sarawak, responsible for managing the pre-preparation of its menu choices.\nKey highlights of the menu include SugarBun's Broasted Chicken, hailed as their top-selling item; Additionally, patrons have the opportunity to savor a spicy variant of this popular dish known as Lak Lak Chicken. These dishes are often complemented with Savory Rice and pickles, which are considered signature accompaniments. Alternatively, mashed potatoes and coleslaw are available as options to complete the meal.\nFurthermore, the menu features a selection of Western-influenced dishes, including Spaghetti, Fish fillet and savory rice, Chickies (chicken breast fillets) and Fish and chips. Moreover, they also offer a diverse selection of burgers such as the classic Fish Burger, Swingger Burger, as well as Chicken and Beef options.\nPatrons can also enjoy an array of Asian-inspired dishes, such as the Broasted Kano Meal with options for Pedas and Satay sauce. Traditional favorites include Sambal Eco-Fish, Garoupa Fried Rice, Nasi Lemak and Chicken Curry. Moreover, the menu boasts claypot specialties like Chicken Mushroom, Beef Stew and Assam Fish, served with a choice of mixed grain rice or steamed fragrant rice, depends of the outlet. The menu further offers a range of soups, including Chicken Mushroom Soup and Fish Soup.\nApart from its diverse menu offerings, SugarBun also sells Borneo Specialty Sauce. This includes Sabasco sauce, originating from Sabah's momporok chili from Kunak, as well as Borneo Tuhau Wild Borneo Chilli.\nThe fast-food chain also provides a range of beverages, featuring popular choices like the three-layer tea, iced Milo, and three-layer coffee. In 2019, SugarBun's franchisor, SB Supplies & Logistics Sdn Bhd, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Coca-Cola Malaysia. This agreement grants Coca-Cola Malaysia the right to become the official soft drink provider at SugarBun and Pezzo East Malaysia outlets.\nNotably, the restaurant is progressively eliminating the use of flavor enhancers like monosodium glutamate (MSG) in its culinary creations. This aligns with the growing demand for healthier dining options among its patrons.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\n\n\n== References ==",

The by-election was held following the death of incumbent mayor Pat Reilly.\nAlthough she finished in third place on first preferences, Independent Liberal candidate Gail Giles-Gidney won the by-election with 50.8% of the vote after preference distribution.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Pat Reilly death ===\nOn 21 January 2014, mayor Pat Reilly died following a short illness. He had been a councillor since 1987, served as mayor since September 1997, and became the first directly elected Willoughby mayor in 1999.\nReilly's funeral was held one week later on 28 January, and was attended by around 1,000 people, including former prime minister Bob Hawke, then-federal treasurer Joe Hockey, and then-Willoughby MP (and future NSW premier) Gladys Berejiklian.\n\n\n=== Previous election results ===\n\nReilly had most recently been re-elected in 2012, where he defeated his only opponent, Stuart Coppock, with 53.3% of the vote.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n10 candidates contested the by-election, including independent candidates with highly similar names − John C. Owen and John Owens.\nThe Labor Party chose to endorse Independent Labor councillor Nic Wright as their candidate.\nCandidates are listed in the order they appeared on the ballot:\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n2014 Newcastle lord mayoral by-election\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2003, Atkinson returned to his native Queensland to play with the Reds, where he was used in most backline positions. His time at the Reds was impacted by injury, missing most of 2003 with a broken ankle, playing all but one Super 12 match in 2004, before being sidelined for all of 2005 by shoulder surgery. He had a stint in Japan with Kyuden Voltex and was a player-coach for South Darwin on his return home.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTim Atkinson at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "The 2013 Comorian coup attempt was a failed coup d'état in the Comoros against President Ikililou Dhoinine. Motives for the coup include discontent from the dismissals of officials connected with Dhoinine's predecessor Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, such as the head of the army. Former President Sambi, who had backed Dhoinine in the 2010 Comorian presidential election, was sidelined and kicked from his inner circle after the election.\nIn April 2013, state security apprehended as many as sixteen individuals due to suspicions of \"planning a destabilizing act\" within the country. Those detained include the son of former President Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane and a former Minister - Mahmoud Ahmed Abdallah. Foreign nationals were also implicated in the scheme, namely a French national, a Chadian national, and five Congolese nationals. The remaining individuals were Comorian military and civilian personnel. The detainees were then taken into custody in Kandani military camp.\nFrance indicated its willingness to cooperate with the country with the French ambassador pledging the country's support after being informed some of its citizens were involved in the foiled coup. \nThree days after the suspects were detained, Interior Minister Hamada Abdallah confirmed the coup attempt but provided no further details, only assuring that the country was safe, saying \"Be reassured, because the country is safe.\" Though opposition leaders initially criticized the government for their secrecy regarding information around the incident, they later organized protests along with the ruling party to denounce the coup attempt. The united march centered around condemning mercenaries aiming to disrupt political stability within the country as the opposition claimed Patrick Klein, who had worked under the infamous Bob Denard, had significant involvement in the failed coup. Bob Denard was involved in four different coup attempts in the Comoros.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Cremasque Territory (Cremish Lombard: Teretore cremàsch, Italian: Territorio cremasco) is a geographical area located in the Lombardy, corresponding to the northern part of the Province of Cremona, of which it represents the most industrialized and densely inhabited area. Its main center is the city of Crema and currently constitutes one of the 4 employment districts into which the province of Cremona is divided.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe identity of the Cremasque territory and its inhabitants has been formed and consolidated around the city of Crema in the course of a centuries-old history, full of significant and lasting events that have distinguished and characterized this particular geographical area in a specific way.\n\nThe first documentary quotes of the locality of Crema date back to the 11th century and, since 1084, it is constantly defined as castrum Cremæ, that is, a castle or a village protected by a belt of walls. If the historical certification of Crema is relatively late, its development as a center of attraction and power in the Fulcheria Island, the territory with ill-defined borders that surrounded it and to which is well attached the name of \"island\" because it is enclosed between the Adda and Serio rivers whose course widened into large swamps, called Lake Gerundo. The first written testimony of the name Insula Fulchéria (or Insula Fulchérii) dates back to February 1040, when the bishop of Cremona Ubaldo went to the court of Emperor Henry III to submit to him a document that would have granted the Cremonese diocese the districtio on the Insula Fulcherii at the expense of Boniface III of Canossa, margrave of Tuscany, who held it for feudal investiture.\nSince this date, Cremona's interest in Crema and the Fulcheria Island is evident. Located close to the risorgive line, in a dominant position with respect to the waterways and land, at the intersection of the main north–south and east–west communication lines (Bergamo-Piacenza, Milan-Cremona, Brescia-Pavia), Crema and the Cremasque territory were a territory \"in formation\", strategically important although still unsustirable and unsuitable for cultivation because mostly covered by woods and above all by swamps and marshes, heritage of an ancient sea or Lake Gerundo and constantly fed by the numerous fountains. Water was therefore the characteristic element of the whole area, enclosed and intersected by important rivers (Adda, Tormo, Serio and Oglio) and frequently subject to their violent floods if not even bed variations. It is not excluded that a spontaneous or artificial change of the bed of Serio, bringing it very close to the nascent city of Crema, together with the intense reclamations started in that eleventh century, have contributed to stimulating the expansionist aims of the much more powerful nearby cities (Milan and Cremona in particular) in a period in which there is a general degradation of the feudal institutes and the Curtense economy alongside the re-flowering and repopulation of the cities and the strengthening within them of the new grades dedicated to craftsmanship and commerce, that city bourgeoisie that, organized in influential arts and crafts guilds, will obtain increasingly relevant political and economic powers until it achieves effective independence from the feudal \"lord\" and imposes the new municipal structures.\nIn 1335 Crema and its territory were annexed to the Duchy of Milan.\n\nStarting in 1449, the Cremasque territory became part of the Republic of Venice, constituting a quasi-exclave included in the Duchy of Milan; a fortified and manned road, called \"la Steccata\" connected it to the Bergamo territory between Castel Gabbiano and Sola.\nThe Diocese of Crema was erected in 1580. Its borders coincide with those of the ancient Cremasque territory formed in the 11th to 12th centuries as a free municipality of Crema. In the Venetian period the representation of the Territory was entrusted to a council composed of a representative per municipality, who elected four mayors, one per door, who was entrusted with the provincial government. By the mid-eighteenth century, only the 28 main municipalities had retained the right to elect their own territorial councilor.\nFor a short period (from March 28, 1797, to July 10, 1797) Crema was the capital of the Republic of Crema, which was then dissolved and aggregated to the Cisalpine Republic.\nAfter the Congress of Vienna this territory passed to the Austrian Empire who created the Kingdom of Lombard-Venetia. Crema and the territory became part of the province of Lodi and Crema, one of the 9 Lombard Provinces of the Government of Lombardy.\nWith the beginning of the Kingdom of Italy, the Cremasque territory, on request sent to the King and the government by eminent Cremasque personalities, became part of the Province of Cremona, a traditionally enemy city of Crema.\nThe territory has its own dialect, the Cremish dialect.\nThere have been various proposals to make the Cremasque territory a province, but none has ever been successful.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe Cremasque territory is the most densely industrialized and inhabited area of the province of Cremona (despit constituting less than a third of the provincial territory, the Cremasque has 48% of the inhabitants).\nThe main centers, in addition to the capital Crema, are Rivolta d'Adda, Pandino and Spino d'Adda.\nThe Cremasque Territory is located at the beginning of the Lower Po Valley. For its location it is rich in resurgences and watercourses. Remediated the marshy land in the Middle Ages, the territory became very fertile for agriculture and rich in water-meadows.\nFrom Crema there are the former State Road 415 Paullese Milano-Cremona, the former State Road 591 Cremasca Bergamo-Piacenza and the former State Road 235 of Orzinuovi Brescia-Pavia. In Castelleone, Madignano, Crema, Casaletto Vaprio and Capralba there are stations on the Treviglio–Cremona railway line.\n\n\n== Historical subdivisions ==\nIn the fourteenth century, the Cremasque territory was divided into communities, called \"villas\", each of which fell under the jurisdiction of one of the 4 wall gates of the city of Crema:\n\nPorta Tadini (Pianengo)\nAzzano, Bordogna, Campagnola, Campisico, Capralba, Casaletto Vaprio, Cremosano, Farinate, Gabbiano, Pianengo, Pieranica, Quintano, Santa Maria della Croce, Sergnano, Torlino, Trescore, Trezolasco, Vairano, and Vidolasco.\nPorta Revolta (Ripalta)\nBolzone, Castelnuovo, Credera, Madignano, Montodine, Moscazzano, Ripalta Arpina, Ripalta Guerrina, Ripalta Nuova, Ripalta Vecchia, Rovereto, San Michele, and Zappello.\nPorta Serio\nBottaiano, Camisano, Casale, Ceredella, Izano, Offanengo, Portico, Ricengo, Salvirola, San Bernardino and Vergonzana.\nPorta Ombriano\nBagnolo, Casaletto Ceredano, Capergnanica, Cascine Capri and Cascine Gandini, Chieve, Monte, Ombriano, Palazzo Pignano, Passarera, Rubbiano with Cascine San Carlo, Scannabue, and Vaiano.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGiuliana Albini, Da castrum a città: Crema fra XII e XV secolo, in Società e storia, n. 42 (XI), October-December 1988.\nGiancarlo Andenna, Le istituzioni ecclesiastiche dall'età longobarda alla fine del XIV secolo, in Giancarlo Andenna and Giorgio Chittolini (ed.), Storia di Cremona.

        "content": "Table-oriented programming (TOP) is a data-focused programming paradigm (as opposed to code-focused), part of the data-oriented group of paradigms.\nThere are three main subtypes of table-oriented programming:\n\nGeneral-purpose TOP languages with tables built in (xBase)\nSpreadsheets\nRelational database languages: Domain-specific tabular languages, often on a remote server, such as SQL\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Mainframe era: 1960s–1978 ===\nDuring this era, table-oriented programming was called decision table programming.\nThe earliest known reference to Decision table programming is DETAB-X, in October 1962.  This led to languages such as Filetab in the late 60s, whose descendants continued in the 70s and 80s.\nThe spreadsheet stream of TOP seems to have begun in 1969, with LANPAR.\nThe relational database concept  was defined by E. F. Codd at IBM in 1970.\n\n\n=== PC era: 1978–1995 ===\nThe general-purpose TOP languages during this era, when the paradigm was labelled at all, were sometimes called Data-oriented languages.  The primary languages during this era were the xBase family (including Clipper and later xHarbour), and the FoxPro family.\nThis was also an era of rising popularity for spreadsheets.  From the release of VisiCalc in 1979, and continuing to Lotus 1-2-3 and the rise of Microsoft Excel, spreadsheets followed the rise of the personal computer in popularity.\nDuring this era, early versions were released of Oracle (1977 onwards), Ingres (1980s), and other Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs).\n\n\n=== Web 1.0 era: 1995–2008 ===\nDuring the Web 1.0 era, the general-purpose TOP stream fell into disuse.  The reasons were twofold.  One was that the languages didn't move to capitalise on the web the way others such as Java did.  The second was the rise in popularity of object-oriented programming.  While the code-focused languages gave birth to object-oriented descendants (e.g. C to C++ et al., Lisp to CLOS), the TOP languages never did so.  While they had superior data-handling facilities, their code-handling facilities didn't compete with the object-oriented languages.\nOne contributing factor was advocacy by Bryce Jacobs (using the aliases Tablizer and TOPMind); the oppositional nature of these interactions led to TOP being dismissed as inferior to OOP (whereas the concepts of TOP could be quite useful within an object-oriented programming context), and his many valid points being dismissed by those not willing to spend the time deciphering his points.  He does, however, seem to have been the first to use the name \"table-oriented programming\", which is the most accurate label for the paradigm.\nThis was an era of consolidation for spreadsheets; Microsoft Excel became the de facto standard, and was eventually left without competitors.\nOn the relational database front, this was the era when MySQL (1995) and PostgreSQL (1996) became popular.\n\n\n=== Web 2.0 era: 2008–2022 ===\nDuring this era, any necessary table-oriented programming was pushed into the RDBMS, and a standard separation of concerns into \"frontend\", \"backend\" and \"database\" was developed.\nSpreadsheets continued as in the previous era, except on the web.  Finally a competitor arose for Excel: Google Sheets.\n\n\n== Features ==\nGeneral-purpose TOP languages share many features with other general-purpose languages.\nThe core feature of TOP is that tables be given a prominent place in the programming language.\n\n\n== Design patterns ==\n\n\n=== Decision tables ===\nDecision tables are a commonly used pattern, especially in the general-purpose TOP languages.  A decision table is a table with columns (usually multiple) which represent inputs, and columns (typically singular, but many be multiple) which represent the outputs.  Each set of inputs is unique, and the rows of the table should cover all possible combinations of inputs.\n\n\n=== Control tables ===\nControl tables are an expansion of decision tables; instead of having output columns, they have code stored in the table.  When the row for that decision is selected, the code stored in the table is run.\n\n\n== TOP languages ==\n\n\n=== General-purpose TOP languages ===\nDETAB-X (1962)\nFiletab (between 1965 and 1968)\nThe XBase programming language family (1986 and following)\nClarion (1986)\n\n\n=== Spreadsheets ===\n\nCategory:Spreadsheet software\n\nLANPAR (1969)\nAutoplan/Autotab (1968) -\nVisiCalc (1979)\nSuperCalc (1980)\nMultiplan (1982)\nLotus 1-2-3 (1982)\nMicrosoft Excel (1985)\nStarOffice (1985) → OpenOffice.org (2000) → Apache OpenOffice (2012) / LibreOffice Calc (2010)\nGoogle Sheets (2006)\n\n\n=== Relational databases ===\nCategory:Database management systems\n\nOracle Database (1977 onwards)\nIngres (1980s)\nMySQL (1995)\nPostgreSQL (1996)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The following is a list of weather events that occurred on Earth in the year 2000. There were several natural disasters around the world from various types of weather, including floods, droughts, heat waves, tornadoes, and tropical cyclones. The deadliest disaster were the 2000 Mozambique Floods which killed 800 people, and the costliest event of the year was Typhoon Saomai, which caused  $6.3 billion (2000 USD) in damages. \n\n\n== Winter storms and cold waves ==\nIn January, an extremely powerful and historic blizzard, commonly referred to as the Carolina Crusher, hit parts of North Carolina and Central Virginia on January 25, causing thousands of power outages within the area leaving 11 inches of snow in Richmond, VA and 20.3 inches in Raleigh-Durham International Airport before moving out to the Atlantic.\nIn December, a significant nor'easter impacted the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States around the end of the month. It began as an Alberta clipper that moved southeastward through the central United States and weakened over the Ohio Valley. The storm dropped heavy precipitation throughout the Northeast, especially in northern New Jersey and eastern New York, where snowfall often exceeded 2 ft (0.61 m). Even so, as it struck on a weekend, its effects were generally minor and mostly limited to travel delays, traffic accidents, and business closures.\n\n\n== Droughts, heat waves, and wildfires ==\nThe 2000 California wildfire season produced multiple wildfires, killing 1 or more people and injuring multiple others. Over 130 buildings were destroyed during the season, amounting to $154 million (2000 USD) in damages. The Storrie Fire on August 17 caused $22 million (2000 USD) in damages, and burned 55,261 acres of land.\nIn August and September, a large heat wave affected parts of the southern United States, with highs commonly peaking well over 100 °F.\n\n\n== Floods ==\n\nIn February and March, a large and deadly flood in Mozambique killed 800 people. The flood caused $500 million (2000 USD) in damages, and is one of Mozambique's worst-ever floods.\nThe Autumn of 2000 was the wettest recorded in the United Kingdom since records began in 1766. Several regions of Atlantic Europe from France to Norway received double their average rainfall and there were severe floods and landslides in the southern Alps. \nThe United Kingdom saw the most extensive nationwide flooding event since the snow-melt of 1947. Prior to 1947, three similar events occurred in the second half of the 19th century where prolonged rainfall led to widespread flooding throughout England in the month of November, in 1894, 1875, and 1852.\nIn November, a catastrophic flood occurred in Hawaii. The floods led to $70 million (2000 USD) in damage, but there were no fatalities. The flood was indirectly triggered by Tropical Storm Paul. \n\n\n== Tornadoes ==\n\nThere were 1,075 tornadoes in the United States alone, collectively resulting in 41 deaths. \n\nOn February 13 and 14, a deadly tornado outbreak killed 18 people, caused 23 injuries and caused more than $20 million (2000 USD) in damages. It was the  single deadliest tornado outbreak in the United States between June 1999 and October 2002.\nOn March 28, a small but deadly tornado outbreak caused extensive damage in downtown Fort Worth, Texas, causing damage to skyscrapers and other buildings. 2 people were killed by this tornado, and 80 more were injured. $450 million (2000 USD) were recorded. Another F3 tornado touched down as part of the outbreak, but caused little damage and no injuries.\nOn April 23, a tornado outbreak produced 33 tornadoes across Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana, with three of these being rated F3. An F1 tornado moved through Shreveport, Louisiana, injuring six people and causing $10,000+ (2000 USD) in damages. In total, 12 people were injured, but no fatalities were recorded.\nOn May 11 and 12, an F3 tornado killed one person near Cedar Falls, Iowa. Another F3 tornado caused two fatalities in Laguna Park, Texas.\nOn May 17 and 18, a small storm system produced 69 tornadoes. One tornado was rated F3, and caused damage to multiple buildings. 2 people were injured.\nOn July 14 an F3 tornado touched down and moved toward Green Acres Campground at Pine Lake, Alberta. 12 people at the campground were killed and over 100 were injured. Winds of up to 300 km/h (190 mph) caused $15.2 million (2000 Canadian dollars) in damage to the campground. It was the fourth-deadliest tornado in Canadian history.\nOn July 25, a small outbreak produced 12 tornadoes, one of which was a violent tornado that hit the city of Granite Falls in Yellow Medicine County, and the tornado killed one person and injured 15 others. It is one of the strongest tornadoes in Minnesota history.\nOn September 20, an F4 tornado struck Xenia, Ohio , killing 1 person and injuring 100 others. The tornado damaged over 150 homes.\nOn December 16, a mid-sized outbreak produced 24 tornadoes, and an F4 tornado in Tuscaloosa, Alabama killed 11 people and injured 144. It was the strongest tornado to hit Alabama since 1950.\n\n\n== Tropical cyclones ==\n\nDuring 2000, tropical cyclones formed in seven different areas called basins, located within various parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. A total of 140 tropical cyclones formed within bodies of water known as tropical cyclone basins, with 81 of them being further named by their responsible weather agencies when they attained maximum sustained winds of 35 knots (65 km/h; 40 mph). The strongest storm of the year was Cyclone Hudah, peaking with a minimum pressure of 905 hPa (26.72 inHg), and with 10-minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (135 mph). The highest confirmed number of deaths from a storm was from Typhoon Kai-tak, which killed 188 people, however, Leon–Eline may have killed up to 722 people. The costliest storm was Saomai, which caused $6.3 billion in damage. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for the 2000 (seven basins combined), as calculated by Colorado State University was 677.3 units.\nThere was an above-average number of storms during the year; the most active basin of the year was the Western Pacific, where a below-average 23 named storms formed. The Eastern Pacific and the North Atlantic were both relatively above-average, with 19 named storms forming in the Eastern Pacific and 15 in the North Atlantic. The Southern Hemisphere was also relatively average. Three Category 5 tropical cyclones were formed in 2000.\n\n\n== References ==",
