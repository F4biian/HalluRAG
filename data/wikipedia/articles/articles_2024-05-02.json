        "content": "Arsenio Arocha Guillén (22 August 1912 – 14 October 1990) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Madrid FC and Real Betis, winning a Copa del Rey with the former in 1934 and a La Liga title with the latter in 1934–35. He was also known as Arocha II in order to be distinguished from his older brother Ángel Arocha. He later became a manager, taking charge over UD Las Palmas in 1950.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nBorn in Chimiche, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Arocha began his football career at CD Tenerife, where he reached the highest levels in Canary Islands football at that time, becoming a part of the team that for many fans has been the best Tenerife side in its history, which was Champion of the Canary Islands in 1932 and that subsequently participated in the 1932 Spanish Cup.\nThis Tenerife team was made up of players who would soon confirm their category by being signed, most of them, by clubs from the first division, including Arocha, who was signed in 1933 by Real Madrid, where he had few chances. In fact, he only played two matches for the club, one in the cup and one in the Centro Regional Championship, and by playing in these matches, Arocha thus belonged to the squad that then won the titles. Due to the difficulty in finding a place among the starting eleven, he decided to leave the club at the end of the 1933–34 season, and joined Real Betis, for whom he played until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nA few years after retiring, Arocha returned to football as a coach, taking over RCD Córdoba in the 1947–48 season and then UD Las Palmas in the 1950–51 season. When he was the coach of UD Tenerife in 1943–44, Arocha agreed to the request of Luis Molowny, then a boy, to have him play, and after observing his great aptitudes at the end of the training session, Arocha said: \"If you wish, you can consider yourself a player for the youth team CD Tenerife\", and in fact, Molowny triumphed that season as a youth forward and his move to the top team.\nIn January 1950, Arocha, then linked to Atlético Madrid, was chosen as the coach of the Canary Islands autonomous football team for a match against the powerful Argentinian team of San Lorenzo de Almagro, and he formed a Canarian XI made up of seven Gran Canarians, three Tenerifens and one Palmero, which also had the likes of Luis Molowny and Rosendo Hernández, and in the end, his selection and his leadership paid off as the Canaries won 4–2. Speaking of Molowny, it is claimed that Arocha was the one who recommended him to Real.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nMadrid FC\n\nCopa del Rey:\nChampions (1): 1934\nReal Betis\n\nCopa del Rey:\nChampions (1): 1935\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Real Madrid CF players\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Arcadio Arteaga Oñate (6 December 1902), also known by his nickname Quirico Arteaga, was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Athletic Bilbao and Atlético Madrid.\nHe later became a manager, taking charge over Atlético Madrid, Recreativo de Huelva, and Real Valladolid.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nArteaga was born in the Biscayan town of Bilbao on 6 December 1902, and he began his football career at SD Erandio Club in 1922, at the age of 19. While there, he stood out as a solid midfielder, so he eventually became part of the first team of Athletic Bilbao in 1924, making his official debut on 11 October 1925, helping his side to a 5–0 win over Sestao Sport Club. He remained at Athletic Club until 1928, playing a total of 34 competitive matches, including 9 Copa del Rey games and 25 in the Biscay Championship, which he won three times in 1925–26, 1926–27, and 1927–28.\nIn 1928, Arteaga signed for Atlético Madrid, making his official debut as a colchonero on 16 September 1928 in a Centro Regional Championship fixture against the CD Nacional de Madrid, which ended in a 3–1 victory. He then played in the inaugural La Liga season in 1929, although he was unable to avoid his team being relegated to the Segunda División. In Atlético, he formed a memorable midfield with Victoriano de Santos and Eduardo Ordóñez, which became known as the \"three musketeers\". He hung up his boots in 1932, at the end of his fourth season at Atlético. In total, he played 104 official matches, 37 in the Biscay Championship, 11 in the cup, and 56 in the league, 36 of which in the first division, but he never managed to score a single goal.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\nAfter his career as a player ended, Arteaga remained linked to Atlético Madrid as a coach, taking charge of the club for a brief period of time at the end of the 1932–33 season. He oversaw a total of six matches with a balance of three wins, two losses, and a draw, plus 13 goals scored and 9 conceded. After leaving Atlético, he coached another Madrid team, the AD Ferroviaria, before signing in 1936 for CD Badajoz.\nAfter the Spanish Civil War ended in 1939, Arteaga directed Recreativo de Huelva in the 1940–41 season, from where he then moved to UD Salamanca, which he coached from 1941 to 1943 in the Second Division. In his first season at the club, he signed Pruden from Atlético Aviación, the top scorer of the first division in the previous season, and this investment paid off as they ended up having an excellent campaign and qualified in second position to play for promotion to the top division, and although they did not achieve it, Arteaga went down in history as the first sports director in Salamanca's history to compete for a promotion to the top division. In a second unfortunate season, Arteaga was dismissed in May 1943, following its relegation to the third division. Days before his dismissal, Salamanca lost 5–1 to Real Madrid in the first leg of the 1943 Copa del Generalísimo, and he responded forcefully to a question about the return fixture, stating, \"Salamanca in Calvary will, yes, make the greatest of its efforts; because the opposite would not be his norm and would also constitute a serious sin of unsportsmanlike behavior\".\nHis next team was SD Ceuta in the 1943–44 season in the Second Division. Arteaga was then commissioned by Real Valladolid in the 1944–45 season, to raise a team that had just been relegated to third division, but he was not able to achieve it. In 1944–45, however, Valladolid reached the final of the 1944–45 Copa Federación de España, which ended in a 0–1 loss to FC Martinenc. In 1945 his name was considered to be named the Spanish national manager, although he was finally not chosen for the position, which Jacinto Quincoces went on to hold.\nIn 1946 he refused to coach Cartagena FC, accepting the offer of CD Logroñés, which he would coach, in the third division in the 1946–47 season.\nFrom that moment on, there are no more references to his sporting career, nor is there any date on which his death occurred. His name does not appear among those who, starting in 1949, obtained the title of coach in Spain.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Player ===\nAthletic Bilbao\nBiscay Championship: 1925–26, 1926–27, and 1927–28\n\n\n=== Manager ===\nReal Valladolid\nCopa Federación de España: Runner-up in 1944–45\n\n\n== References ==",

The film was produced during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nProduced by Bobby D'Buze, the film brought Shehata international acclaim and introduced Pople and Kenny to worldwide audiences in their featurette film debuts. It was also a festival success, scoring over 25 awards and four nominations at international festivals. Since April 2024, the film is available on Amazon's Prime Video in the UK and the US.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nWhen Lester Landon, a dyslexic criminal working for a dodgy luxury watch dealership, decides on \"the straight and narrow\" he is tasked with one last job before he is set free. Time is running out as the ghosts of his past are coming back to haunt him. It stars Nicholas Pople, Alan Kenny, and Anna Arthur.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nLocations include Mayfair and Chats Palace which were used to stage luxury watch dealerships. Edgware Road and the Victoria Memorial were used for exterior shots featuring the convertible Rolls Royce Corniche. Millennium Bridge was used as the backdrop for one of the climactic action scenes.\nThe film was exclusively shot on a compact Blackmagic Design setup with a Rokinon cine lens set.\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe Swiss newspaper St. Galler Tagblatt called the film \"fast, glamorous, excellent!\"\nThe Austrian newspaper Tiroler Tageszeitung called The Nautilus Mutiny a \"smash hit\" and \"visually stunning\".  The Kronen Zeitung stated that the film is \"packed with action and suspense.\"\nThe highly critical UK film review said \"...The Nautilus Mutiny is a really well made film\" and compared it to Guy Ritchie's and Matthew Vaughn's films from the early 2000s. \nElliot Grove, the founder of the [[Raindance Film Festival] and the British Independent Film Awards said \"The Nautilus Mutiny! In 30 years of running these festivals and the film school, I've never seen anybody create such a high quality film as their first one! It's sparkling!\" \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Nautilus Mutiny at IMDb",

His father was a Presbyterian minister who played a prominent part in the American Revolution and was known as the \"Fighting Parson\". Caldwell's family home was burned by Loyalists in 1780.\nAfter his father's murder in 1781, Caldwell was placed under the care of his legal guardian Elias Boudinot, who sent him to live in the home of Rev. Alexander MacWhorter. Caldwell was later adopted by Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, who took him with his family upon his return to France in 1782. Caldwell was educated in a French boarding school during that period. In 1785, Caldwell and the family of Lafayette dined with John Adams.

        "content": "Lingotto is a neighbourhood in Turin, Italy. The district was first established in the 17th century and saw significant growth when the Fiat Lingotto plant opened. Lingotto contains the Parco Di Vittorio and is close to the Oval Lingotto and the Lingotto multifunctional complex.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn pre-Roman times, the area around modern-day Lingotto was settled by the Celtic population of the Ligoni. Lingotto was established around the 15th century as a rural latifundium between Turin and Moncalieri, taking its name from the agricultural farmhouse that stood along the ancient road connecting Grugliasco to Moncalieri, the current Via Passo Buole.\nAt the beginning of the 17th century the village expanded as artisans and farmers moved in protected both by the feudal dominion of Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy and by the Catholic diocese of Valfré, who evangelized much of the southern area of the Savoy capital. The small church of Lingotto, built in 1686 a few meters from the Cascina, was dedicated to John the Baptist and subsequently destroyed by the aerial bombings of 4 June 1944 during World War II, then replaced by the current Immacolata Concezione e San Giovanni Battista, consecrated in 1978.\nIn 1765, the area passed to Count Carlo Pietro Avenati of the Rebaudengo di Mondovì branch, under the protection of the Savoy. In 1788, the cemetery was annexed to the small Lingotto church, on the south side of the current via Passo Buole, where the Parco Di Vittorio municipal park now stands.\nIn 1915, the newly-established Fiat set up its car production plant on the remains of the ancient farm of Carlo Felice Nicolis, conte di Robilant which took the name of Fiat Lingotto. The factory soon became Fiat's main factory with the transfer of production from the previous workshops in Corso Dante. The district was completed only in 1922; industry quickly transformed the village, making it go from a rural place to a working-class neighborhood. From 1922 to 1936, the presence of Fiat Lingotto, before the birth of the Mirafiori plant, brought rapid economic development throughout the area. In 1982, the factory was closed down as the Fiat Mirafiori plant made it obsolete in the late 1970s.\nIn preparation for the 2006 Winter Olympics, the district saw the nearby addition of the Oval Lingotto and the renovation of the old Fiat Lingotto plant into a multifunctional complex. Since the 2006 Olympics, the Oval Lingotto has been used to host fairs and expeditions.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nLingotto is directly served by the Torino Lingotto railway station and is just west of the Turin Metro's Lingotto, Italia '61-Regione Piemonte, and Bengasi stations.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hermann Epenstein (born 1850 or 1851 in Berlin; died June 5, 1934 in Mauterndorf), known from 1910 until the abolition of nobility in Austria in 1919 as Hermann Epenstein Ritter von Mauternburg; was a German-Austrian physician and merchant.\nHe was best known as the owner of Mauterndorf Castle, which he had extensively rebuilt, refurbished and restored; and for being the godfather, and later stepfather, to Albert and Hermann Göring.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nEpenstein was the son of a Catholic mother and father who had converted from Judaism to marry, and was therefore considered a Mischling (half-Jew) in Nazi terminology. He became a royal Prussian staff physician. Through trade, he became very wealthy and held politically German nationalist views.\nDuring a stay in German South West Africa, he met the local imperial commissioner Heinrich Ernst Göring and his wife Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859–15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant, whom he assisted in childbirth. Back in Germany, the Görings lived in his house in Berlin-Friedenau (Fregestraße 19). Franziska became Epenstein's lover. She openly maintained the relationship with him, staying with him during visits while her husband was accommodated elsewhere. Epenstein became the godfather of all five of Göring's children from his second marriage, including Hermann and Albert.\nIn 1894, Epenstein acquired the dilapidated Mauterndorf Castle in Salzburg and had it rebuilt by 1904. In 1897, he also bought Veldenstein Castle north of Nuremberg for 20,000 marks. He invested over a million marks until 1914 to restore the castle's former appearance. Epenstein made the castle available as a residence for the Göring family. Hermann Göring also visited his \"adoptive father\" Epenstein at Mauterndorf Castle, which he later called \"the castle of his youth.\" Epenstein's fondness for castles and medieval splendor shaped the young Hermann's imagination.\nIn 1909, Epenstein became an Austrian citizen and lived in Mauterndorf after World War I. In appreciation of the reconstruction of Mauterndorf Castle, Emperor Franz Joseph I ennobled him on August 8, 1910, into the knightly rank.\nIn 1913, relations soured between the Görings and Epenstein after he married for the first time at the age of 62: the much younger Elisabeth \"Lilly\" Schandrovich Edle von Kriegstreu (1887–1939).\nAfter the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, Göring found refuge with Epenstein in Mauterndorf. When Epenstein died in 1934, he left the castles to his wife, who in turn appointed Göring, as per Epenstein's wish, as the heir.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Chłop Lake is a ribbon lake located within the Pszczew Landscape Park, in the Lubusz Voivodeship, in the Międzyrzecz County, in the Gmina Pszczew. About 1 km from the northern end of the lake lies the town of Pszczew.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\nChłop Lake is located in the central part of the Pszczew Landscape Park. The southeastern shore of the lake marks the border between the Lubusz and Greater Poland Voivodeships. Chłop Lake is a ribbon lake of glacial origin, quite large and relatively deep. It stretches from north to south and has a well-developed shoreline with a narrow, winding bay in the eastern part, into which the large peninsula known as Jelenia Głowa protrudes from the south. The lake is almost entirely surrounded by forests. Along the eastern shore of the lake, there are elevations, with the highest, Góra Wysoka, rising to 101 meters above sea level. There is one small island on the lake. The bottom of the body of water is diverse, with several deeper spots and numerous shallows. Three small streams flow into the lake, two of which periodically dry up. Excess water is drained to the south by a small stream into Wędromierz Lake.\n\n\n== Hydronymics ==\nThe lake appears in sources as early as 1460, initially as Chlop, and later as: Chlop (1564, 1594), Chłop (1640), Klop See (1845), Klopp See (1940). Currently, the standardized name Chłop is in use, and the national register of geographic names does not list any alternative or additional names.\n\n\n== Morphometrics ==\nAccording to the data from the Inland Fisheries Institute, the surface area of the lake's water mirror is 2.28 square kilometers, while A. Choiński, using a planimeter on maps at a scale of 1:50,000, determined the lake's size to be 2.23 square kilometers. The uniform part of the lake's surface waters covers an area of 215 hectares.\nThe average depth of the water reservoir is 9.0 meters, and the maximum depth is 23.0 meters. The volume of the lake is 20,579.6 thousand m3. The maximum length of the lake is 4.15 kilometers, and the width is 0.97 kilometers. The length of the shoreline is 12.35 kilometers.\nAccording to the Atlas of Polish Lakes (ed. J. Jańczak, 1996), the water level is at an altitude of 53.7 meters above sea level, while according to the numerical terrain model provided by Geoportal, the water level is at an altitude of 52.5 meters above sea level.\nAccording to the Map of Hydrographic Division of Poland, the lake is located in the drainage basin of the tenth level. The identifier is 187875921. The direct drainage basin of the lake covers an area of 77.2 km2.\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn the water management system, the lake forms a uniform water body part with the code PLLW10360. The administrator is the Regional Water Management Board in Poznań, which has established a fishery district covering the waters of this lake called the Fishery District of Chłop Lake on the Struga Wrońska watercourse – No. 1. The fishery management on the lake is conducted by the Trzciel Fisheries Farm.\nThe lake serves recreational purposes. In 2006, there were several recreational centers, two camping sites, and numerous holiday cottages around the lake. On the eastern shore of the water body near Góra Wysoka, one of three identical observation towers built by the Gmina Pszczew is located. The tower measures 18.66 meters.\n\n\n== Water purity and environmental protection ==\nIn the years 1985, 1994, 2000, and 2006, the waters of Chłop Lake were classified as Class II purity. Comparing the results from these years indicates that the water quality of Chłop Lake has not undergone significant changes. Over the years, water transparency has fluctuated depending on the season, ranging from 1.7 to 3.7 meters. Environmental inspectors from the Regional Inspectorate for Environmental Protection pointed out that the construction of a sewage treatment plant for Pszczew in 1996, along with the discharge of treated sewage directly into the Obra river, outside the lake's catchment area, contributed to maintaining water quality. The closure of the distillery in Pszczew, which was discharging sewage directly into the lake, also had a positive impact on water cleanliness.\nChłop Lake has been classified as fairly resistant to degrading external influences, thus falling into the II category of susceptibility to degradation. This means that it is a lake with good natural conditions. Factors negatively affecting this indicator include a low level of thermal stratification and the shoreline-to-volume ratio. On the other hand, factors contributing positively to the lake's resilience include low water turnover (40% annually), a relatively small catchment area compared to its volume, considerable average depth, and the predominance of forests in the immediate vicinity of the lake.\nResearch conducted in 2020 classified the waters of the lake as having a good ecological status, corresponding to Class II quality. The classification was based on the ecological status of macrophytes, ichthyofauna, and benthic invertebrates, while phytoplankton and phytobenthos were assessed as very good. However, the chemical state of the waters was determined to be below good, with exceeding permissible concentrations of PBDE, mercury, and heptachlor in fish tissues. Water transparency was measured at 2.8 meters.\nThe lake is located within the Pszczew Landscape Park established in 1986 and within the boundaries of two Natura 2000 network areas: the Special Area of Conservation Rynna Jezior Obrzańskich PLH080002 and the Special Protection Area Jeziora Pszczewskie i Dolina Obry PLB080005.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Stjepan Matičević (19 December 1880 - 16 June 1940) was a Croatian pedagogue, philosopher, university professor and academic.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStjepan Matičević was born in Gradishte, near Kutjeva, Croatia. After primary and secondary education, he studied philosophy in Zagreb and Vienna, where he obtained his doctorate. For study purposes, he also stayed in Leipzig and Jena. Among other things, he was a professor at the pedagogical high school, then at the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb, where he taught theoretical pedagogy and philosophy. He was the founder of the Pedagogical Institute in Zagreb (1936). He is committed to the autonomy of pedagogy, but linked to axiology and psychology.

        "content": "Raya Wa Sekina (Arabic: ريا وسكينة) is an Egyptian musical comedy play. The theatrical production commenced its run in 1980 at the Freedom Theater in Cairo, and then it was performed at Alexandria, Egypt in the summer of 1982, marking a significant departure for renowned artist Shadia, as it was her sole venture into the realm of theater. Despite her initial reservations, she took on a leading role in the play. Then, the play was performed for many years in the 1980s. The play is helmed by director Hussein Kamal, with the script penned by writer Bahgat Kamar, and It starred well-known Egyptian figures such as Shadia, Soher El Bably, Abdel Moneim Madbouly, Ahmad Bedair, Naeem Issa, and Amal Salem. Set against the backdrop of Cairo, the show offered a blend of humor and music, drawing audiences into its narrative. Among the cast, Saeed Saleh took on the role of a radio broadcaster. The play unfolds over the course of three acts, comprising a total of eight scenes. It unfolds over a duration of 3 hours and 50 minutes. Some critics said that the play is based on the 1953 film and true story of two Alexandrian serial killers, directed by Salah Abu Seif.\nThe play's narrative is anchored in the real-life tale of Raya and Sakina, yet it takes a comedic turn with the introduction of a humorous characters. The storyline centers on two impoverished sisters, Raya and Sakina, who resort to murdering their stepmother, Amouna, when she attempts to coerce them into returning to their homeland. Following Amouna's death, the sisters seize her gold and devise a plan to conceal the crime. Raya enters into marriage with Hasab Allah, while Sakina weds Abd El-'Al, an officer in the police department, in an effort to deflect suspicion. This scheme becomes a pattern for them, as they lure unsuspecting women into their home, subsequently killing them and pilfering their gold.\nShadia, renowned for her prowess in other artistic domains, had adamantly steered clear of theatrical ventures until director Hussein Kamal proposed an unconventional approach. Initially hesitant, fearing a potential dent in her established reputation should she falter on stage, Shadia reluctantly agreed to peruse the script. However, upon immersing herself in the narrative, she found herself drawn to the lead role, prompting her to take a daring leap into the world of theater. As the curtains rose on the play's debut in Alexandria in the summer of 1982, tensions flared between Shadia and fellow actor Hamdy Ahmed, leading to him ultimatum for his exclusion from the production. Her demand was met, and Ahmad Bedair assumed the role, ensuring the seamless continuation of the play's run for several years thereafter.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe play commences by introducing Abd El-'Al (Ahmad Bedair), a new officer in the urban area who hails from a distant village and struggles to adapt to city life. Shortly thereafter, Amouna, the stepmother of Raya (Shadia) and Sekina (Soher El Bably), enters the scene. The two sisters, grappling with poverty, resort to murdering Amouna after she pressures them to return to their homeland, seizing her gold in the process. To dispose of the body, Raya weds Hasaballah (Abdel Moneim Madbouly), who assists in burying Amouna in the basement.\nSubsequently, the trio embarks on a spree of killings in the El Labban neighborhood, targeting women. As reports of missing women escalate, suspicions arise within the police force. To allay these suspicions, Sekina marries Abd El-'Al, and unbeknownst to him, the trio continue their gruesome activities without Abd El-'Al's knowledge. The missing women, often adorned with gold jewelry and carrying substantial amounts of money, are frequently last seen in the company of the sisters. Despite repeated questioning, Sekina manages to evade suspicion until the truth is ultimately revealed to Abd El-'Al and the authorities, leading to their execution.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRaya and Sekina at IMDb \nRaya and Sekina on Netflix\nRaya and Sekina at Rotten Tomatoes",

        "content": "The more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of intellectual history and literary history throughout the 20th century, without any great measure of consensus emerging. That it was part of the Counter-Enlightenment, a reaction against the Age of Enlightenment, is generally accepted in current scholarship. Its relationship to the French Revolution, which began in 1789 in the very early stages of the period, is clearly important, but highly variable depending on geography and individual reactions. Most Romantics can be said to be broadly progressive in their views, but a considerable number always had, or developed, a wide range of conservative views, and nationalism was in many countries strongly associated with Romanticism, as discussed in detail below.\n\n\n== Evolution of the term \"Romanticism\" ==\n\n\n=== Etymology and origins of the term ===\nThe group of words with the root \"Roman\" in the various European languages, such as \"romance\" and \"Romanesque\", has a complicated history. By the 18th century, European languages – notably German, French and Slavic languages – were using the term \"Roman\" in the sense of the English word \"novel\", i.e. a work of popular narrative fiction. This usage derived from the term \"Romance languages\", which referred to vernacular (or popular) language in contrast to formal Latin. Most such novels took the form of \"chivalric romance\", tales of adventure, devotion and honour.\nThe founders of Romanticism, critics (and brothers) August Wilhelm Schlegel and Friedrich Schlegel, began to speak of romantische Poesie (\"romantic poetry\") in the 1790s, contrasting it with \"classic\" but in terms of spirit rather than merely dating. Friedrich Schlegel wrote in his 1800 essay Gespräch über die Poesie (\"Dialogue on Poetry\"):\n\nI seek and find the romantic among the older moderns, in Shakespeare, in Cervantes, in Italian poetry, in that age of chivalry, love and fable, from which the phenomenon and the word itself are derived.\nThe modern sense of the term spread more widely in France by its persistent use by Germaine de Staël in her De l'Allemagne (1813), recounting her travels in Germany. In England Wordsworth wrote in a preface to his poems of 1815 of the \"romantic harp\" and \"classic lyre\", but in 1820 Byron could still write, perhaps slightly disingenuously,\n\nI perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a great struggle about what they call 'Classical' and 'Romantic', terms which were not subjects of classification in England, at least when I left it four or five years ago.\nIt is only from the 1820s that Romanticism certainly knew itself by its name, and in 1824 the Académie française took the wholly ineffective step of issuing a decree condemning it in literature.\n\n\n=== Application of the term to music ===\nAlthough the term \"Romanticism\" when applied to music has come to imply the period roughly from 1800 until 1850, or else until around 1900, the contemporary application of \"romantic\" to music did not coincide with this modern interpretation. Indeed, one of the earliest sustained applications of the term to music occurs in 1789, in the Mémoires of André Grétry. This is of particular interest because it is a French source on a subject mainly dominated by Germans, but also because it explicitly acknowledges its debt to Jean-Jacques Rousseau (himself a composer, amongst other things) and, by so doing, establishes a link to one of the major influences on the Romantic movement generally. In 1810 E. T. A. Hoffmann named Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven as \"the three masters of instrumental compositions\" who \"breathe one and the same romantic spirit\". He justified his view on the basis of these composers' depth of evocative expression and their marked individuality. In Haydn's music, according to Hoffmann, \"a child-like, serene disposition prevails\", while Mozart (in the late E-flat major Symphony, for example) \"leads us into the depths of the spiritual world\", with elements of fear, love, and sorrow, \"a presentiment of the infinite ... in the eternal dance of the spheres\". Beethoven's music, on the other hand, conveys a sense of \"the monstrous and immeasurable\", with the pain of an endless longing that \"will burst our breasts in a fully coherent concord of all the passions\". This elevation in the valuation of pure emotion resulted in the promotion of music from the subordinate position it had held in relation to the verbal and plastic arts during the Enlightenment. Because music was considered to be free of the constraints of reason, imagery, or any other precise concept, it came to be regarded, first in the writings of Wackenroder and Tieck and later by writers such as Schelling and Wagner, as preeminent among the arts, the one best able to express the secrets of the universe, to evoke the spirit world, infinity, and the absolute.\n\nThis chronologic agreement of musical and literary Romanticism continued as far as the middle of the 19th century, when Richard Wagner denigrated the music of Meyerbeer and Berlioz as \"neoromantic\": \"The Opera, to which we shall now return, has swallowed down the Neoromanticism of Berlioz, too, as a plump, fine-flavoured oyster, whose digestion has conferred on it anew a brisk and well-to-do appearance.\"\nIt was only toward the end of the 19th century that the newly emergent discipline of Musikwissenschaft (musicology)—itself a product of the historicizing proclivity of the age—attempted a more scientific periodization of music history, and a distinction between Viennese Classical and Romantic periods was proposed. The key figure in this trend was Guido Adler, who viewed Beethoven and Franz Schubert as transitional but essentially Classical composers, with Romanticism achieving full maturity only in the post-Beethoven generation of Frédéric Chopin, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt. From Adler's viewpoint, found in books like Der Stil in der Musik (1911), composers of the New German School and various late-19th-century nationalist composers were not Romantics but \"moderns\" or \"realists\" (by analogy with the fields of painting and literature), and this schema remained prevalent through the first decades of the 20th century.\nBy the second quarter of the 20th century, an awareness that radical changes in musical syntax had occurred during the early 1900s caused another shift in historical viewpoint, and the change of century came to be seen as marking a decisive break with the musical past. This in turn led historians such as Alfred Einstein to extend the musical \"Romantic era\" throughout the 19th century and into the first decade of the 20th. It has continued to be referred to as such in some of the standard music references such as The Oxford Companion to Music and Grout's History of Western Music but was not unchallenged. For example, the prominent German musicologist Friedrich Blume, the chief editor of the first edition of Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (1949–86), accepted the earlier position that Classicism and Romanticism together constitute a single period beginning in the middle of the 18th century, but at the same time held that it continued into the 20th century, including such pre-World War II developments as expressionism and neoclassicism. This is reflected in some notable recent reference works such as the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and the new edition of Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart.\n\n\n== Challenges in scholarship ==\n\n\n=== Defining the Romantic Movement ===\nArthur Lovejoy attempted to demonstrate the difficulty of defining Romanticism in his seminal article \"On The Discrimination of Romanticisms\" in his Essays in the History of Ideas (1948); some scholars see Romanticism as essentially continuous with the present, some like Robert Hughes see in it the inaugural moment of modernity, while writers of the 19th Century such as Chateaubriand, Novalis and Samuel Taylor Coleridge saw it as the beginning of a tradition of resistance to Enlightenment rationalism—a \"Counter-Enlightenment\"— to be associated most closely with German Romanticism. Another early definition comes from Charles Baudelaire: \"Romanticism is precisely situated neither in choice of subject nor exact truth, but in the way of feeling.\"\n\n\n=== Marking the end of the Romantic Era ===\n\nThe end of the Romantic era is marked in some areas by a new style of Realism, which affected literature, especially the novel and drama, painting, and even music, through Verismo opera. This movement was led by France, with Balzac and Flaubert in literature and Courbet in painting; Stendhal and Goya were important precursors of Realism in their respective media. However, Romantic styles, now often representing the established and safe style against which Realists rebelled, continued to flourish in many fields for the rest of the century and beyond. In music such works from after about 1850 are referred to by some writers as \"Late Romantic\" and by others as \"Neoromantic\" or \"Postromantic\", but other fields do not usually use these terms; in English literature and painting the convenient term \"Victorian\" avoids having to characterise the period further.\nIn northern Europe, the Early Romantic visionary optimism and belief that the world was in the process of great change and improvement had largely vanished, and some art became more conventionally political and polemical as its creators engaged polemically with the world as it was. Elsewhere, including in very different ways the United States and Russia, feelings that great change was underway or just about to come were still possible. Displays of intense emotion in art remained prominent, as did the exotic and historical settings pioneered by the Romantics, but experimentation with form and technique was generally reduced, often replaced with meticulous technique, as in the poems of Tennyson or many paintings. If not realist, late 19th-century art was often extremely detailed, and pride was taken in adding authentic details in a way that earlier Romantics did not trouble with. Many Romantic ideas about the nature and purpose of art, above all the pre-eminent importance of originality, remained important for later generations, and often underlie modern views, despite opposition from theorists.\n\n\n== Relationship to nationalism ==\nIn philosophy and the history of ideas, Romanticism was seen by Isaiah Berlin as disrupting for over a century the classic Western traditions of rationality and the idea of moral absolutes and agreed values, leading \"to something like the melting away of the very notion of objective truth\", and hence not only to nationalism, but also fascism and totalitarianism, with a gradual recovery coming only after World War II. For the Romantics, Berlin says, in the realm of ethics, politics, aesthetics it was the authenticity and sincerity of the pursuit of inner goals that mattered; this applied equally to individuals and groups—states, nations, movements. This is most evident in the aesthetics of romanticism, where the notion of eternal models, a Platonic vision of ideal beauty, which the artist seeks to convey, however imperfectly, on canvas or in sound, is replaced by a passionate belief in spiritual freedom, individual creativity. The painter, the poet, the composer do not hold up a mirror to nature, however ideal, but invent; they do not imitate (the doctrine of mimesis), but create not merely the means but the goals that they pursue; these goals represent the self-expression of the artist's own unique, inner vision, to set aside which in response to the demands of some \"external\" voice—church, state, public opinion, family friends, arbiters of taste—is an act of betrayal of what alone justifies their existence for those who are in any sense creative.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

        "content": "Kelsey Hatzell is an American materials scientist who is a professor at Princeton University. Hatzell studies new materials for sustainable technologies, with a focus on next-generation energy storage. She is interested in the nanoscale phenomena responsible for battery failure.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHatzell studied economics at Swarthmore College and mechanical engineering at Pennsylvania State University. She moved to Drexel University for her doctoral research, where she studied flowable electrodes for water and energy technologies with Yury Gogotsi. Her research involved electrochemistry, materials and colloidal science to create new electrode structures. She developed carbon-based and manganese oxide materials for scalable solid-state energy storage systems. After graduating, she moved to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where she developed soft and hard x-ray techniques to understand the properties of polymers.\n\n\n== Research and career ==\nHatzell was appointed an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University. Hatzell joined Princeton University in 2021. Her research considers new materials for sustainable technologies, with a focus on solid-state and redox flow batteries. She is particularly interested in why batteries fail. She identified that irregularities in electrolytes impacted the movement of ions, which could cause battery failure if the ions all migrated to particular locations. Hatzell has created inorganic membranes for high energy density batteries and grid storage.\nHatzell has developed strategies to minimize the costs of direct air capture systems, which generally require energy-intensive operating protocols to reduce the impact of carbon emissions and remove them from the atmosphere. These systems conventionally rely on heat or pressure changes to release captured carbon dioxide into storage (e.g. solvents heated to high temperatures). Hatzell developed an ion-exchange resin, which efficiently capture carbon dioxide at low humidity and release it at high humidity – without the need for high temperatures.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2015 Drexel Office of Graduate Studies Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award\n2020 Sloan Research Fellowship\n2020 Scialog Fellow\n2021 National Science Foundation CAREER Award\n2021 POLiS Award of Excellence\n2022 NASA Early Career Achievement Medal\n2023 Alfred Rheinstein Faculty Award\n2023 Office of Naval Research Award\n2024 Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nChang E Ren; Kelsey B Hatzell; Mohamed Alhabeb; Zheng Ling; Khaled A Mahmoud; Yury Gogotsi (September 25, 2015). \"Charge- and Size-Selective Ion Sieving Through Ti3C2Tx MXene Membranes\".

Current capabilities for systems modeling include SysML and UML textual notation and diagrams, other modeling diagram types, time-based simulation including discrete-event simulation and continuous systems modeling with system dynamics, system reliability modeling, system cost modeling, and systems engineering process and project management. It is interoperable with other modeling tools.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe goals of se-lib are to\n\nLower access barrier to system modeling with open source tool environment.\nProvide integrated capabilities for systems modeling, analysis, and documentation\nBe digital engineering compliant.\nCompatibility with other modeling tools and libraries\nCompatibility of everything on desktop and cloud platforms\nse-lib development has been supported by the Naval Postgraduate School Foundation for critical technologies and education programs \n. As a seed project it was funded for \"adoption of engineers across disciplines in support of digital engineering practice, teaching and research in the DOD\".\nIt has been used in graduate courses for modeling and simulation, capability engineering, and systems software  engineering at Naval Postgraduate School. se-lib has also been used for masters's capstone projects and research deliverables. It has been the subject of professional training venues for systems engineers with the International Council on Systems Engineering.\nThe Boehm Center for Systems and Software Engineering is a cooperating organization.  The se-lib system cost models in particular have been featured and transitioned through the Center.\nse-lib was originally called the Python Modeling Library (PyML), and was renamed to be more specific for systems engineering applications.\n\n\n== Implementation ==\nse-lib is written in Python, and uses the primary libraries of SimPy for discrete event simulation, PySD for a system dynamics engine, Matplotlib for plotting, and graphviz for generating diagrams.\nIt uses the XMILE format for system dynamics models, making it file-compatible with Vensim and Stella for simulation.\n\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\n=== SysML and UML ===\nThe following generates a use case model diagram:\n\n\n=== Discrete Event Simulation ===\nOnline discrete event modeling examples are available in playground mode at.\nA discrete event model for electric car charging is:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGitHub repository",

It was demolished in 1877, being in poor repair, and considered too small for the village.  A new church on the same site was funded by a bequest from James Brown.  It was designed by C. Hodgson Fowler, and was consecrated on 20 November 1878.  The church was grade II listed in 1987.\n\nThe church, designed in the Gothic Revival style, is built of magnesian limestone with a red tile roof.  It consists of a nave, a south porch and a lower chancel.  The nave roof is 30 feet high, and the building is 81 feet long by 21 feet wide.  On the west gable is a bellcote with a pediment and a cross.  The porch entrance has a double-chamfered surround, and above it is a niche containing a statue.  At the west end is a paired two-light window, and the east window has five lights.  It depicts the Ascension of Jesus, and was designed by Jean-Baptiste Capronnier.\n\n\n== See also ==\nListed buildings in Burton Leonard\n\n\n== References ==",

He has represented England as a youth international at multiple levels.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in London, Acheampong is of Ghanaian descent. He first joined Chelsea's academy as an Under-8.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nOn 3 January 2024, Acheampong signed his first professional contract with Chelsea. Acheampong was included in a match-day squad for the Chelsea men's senior team for the first time on 11 March 2024, being named amongst the substitutes in the Premier League match against Newcastle United; however, he ultimately went unused in that game. On 2 May 2024, three days before his 18th birthday, Acheampong made his professional debut, coming on as a substitute in the 85th minute of a 2–0 Chelsea victory at Stamford Bridge over their London derby rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League. His inclusion in the match-day squad against Tottenham came amidst several injuries to more experienced first-team players.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIn May 2023, Acheampong was a member of the England under-17 squad that finished fifth at the 2023 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. In November 2023 he was selected to represent England at the 2023 FIFA U-17 World Cup and scored a goal in their opening game against New Caledonia.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\nAs of match played 2 May 2024\n\n\n== References ==",

However, the building regularly flooded, and following a major inundation in 1892, it was decided to construct a new building, on a site further from the river.  It was designed by C. Hodgson Fowler, and work started in February 1898.  In December, the Archbishop of York ascended scaffolding to afix a cross to the gable end of the roof.  The church was consecrated on 25 July 1899.  The construction cost £5,893, more than budgeted, which meant that more fundraising was required before a tower could be added.  Ultimately, the Archbishop personally paid for a tower, which was constructed in 1903.\n\nThe church is built of sandstone, with a tile roof.  It is in the Gothic Revival style.  It consists of a nave with aisles, a south porch, and a chancel with a south aisle and north vestry.  There is a tower at the west end, with three stages, diagonal buttresses, and battlements.  Most of the windows have Perpendicular tracery.  It has been grade II listed since 1985.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The 18 September Square (Dutch: 18 Septemberplein) is a square in the Dutch city of Eindhoven. It is the connection between Eindhoven Centraal railway station and the city's shopping center.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe square owes its name to the liberation of Eindhoven on September 18, 1944, during Operation Market Garden. On this date, allied armies entered Eindhoven, liberating one of the first cities in the Netherlands from German occupation. From the north came the United States Army and from the south came the British Army; the British Second Army, including the Irish Guards. The Americans met the British in the center of town.\nEach year, a celebration of Eindhoven's liberation and commemoration takes place on September 18.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe square is characterized by the combination of space, luxurious paving, a special design of the entrances to the bicycle basement, water fountains, trees, art, benches and a dynamic play of lights. The free bicycle basement the Tube is accessible by moving walkways and can accommodate about 1,250 bicycles and 60 mopeds. A characteristic feature of the bike shelter is its unusual entrances, which seem to emerge from the ground like tubes. The 18 September Square is home to a C&A, HEMA, De Bijenkorf and McDonald's, among others. In the middle at the edge of the square is the indoor shopping center Piazza Center. On the Emmasingel, next to the Lichttoren is the Blob, a futuristic, blobitecture building that is particularly striking in its surroundings. Also located on the 18 September Square is the Bubble.\nEvery Tuesday a weekly market is held on the 18 September Square from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and the square is filled with numerous stalls.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

In its 3rd year at the Movistar Arena in Buenos Aires, the ceremony will be broadcast on Star+. The nominations were announced on 30 April 2024; Milo J received the most nominations with fifteen, followed by Emilia with twelve.\n\n\n== Background ==\nFor the 2024 ceremony, three new pop categories were introduced, expanding the total number of categories to 50. This move was interpreted as a response to the criticism faced by the awards in the preceding year for overlooking prominent pop artists, notably Lali, in favor of songs that, while popular, did not strictly fit the pop genre, such as \"Muchachos, Ahora Nos Volvimos a Ilusionar\" by La Mosca Tsé - Tsé. The new categories are Best Urban Pop Album and Best Urban Pop Song, while the category for Best Romantic/Melodic Album was rebranded to Best Traditional Pop Album.\n\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nThe nominations were announced on 30 April 2024 on a livestream by Fede Bareiro, Cris Vanadía, Ceci Mendez and Guille Gilabert. Winners will appear first and highlighted in bold.\n\n\n=== General Field ===\n\n\n=== Pop ===\n\n\n=== Rock ===\n\n\n=== Urban & Reggae ===\n\n\n=== Tango, Jazz, Classical & Instrumental ===\n\n\n=== Folk ===\n\n\n=== Tropical & Cuarteto ===\n\n\n=== Alternative & Dance/Electronic ===\n\n\n=== Live, Music Video, Visual Media & Children's ===\n\n\n=== Package, Concept, Historical & Singer-Songwriter ===\n\n\n=== Production & Engineering ===\n\n\n== Multiple nominations and awards ==\nThe following received multiple nominations:\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ganbare Goemon Kirakira Dōchū: Boku ga Dancer ni Natta Wake ('The Glittering Journey: The Reason I Became a Dancer') is an action-adventure game by Konami, which was released for the Super Famicom in 1995.\nIt is the fourth and final game in the Japanese video game series Ganbare Goemon to be released on the Super Famicom and the sequel to Ganbare Goemon 3: Shishi Jūrokubē no Karakuri Manjigatame.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nLike its predecessor Goemon 2, it also has a stage select screen. Each character starts off marooned on their own planet, which they must conquer individually before being able to reunite as a team. There are not as many levels as Goemon 2, but there are also town areas with mini puzzles to solve. Unlike the prequels, there are no longer any first person Impact fights, however, each boss has a mini game (which can be played with up to 4 players), including Konami's puzzle game Taisen Puzzle-Dama. Another mini game is the bungee jump game where Impact has to catch the sword of an enemy mecha bungee jumper. A remake of Time Pilot is also playable in the game after all other secrets have been unlocked.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nGoemon Impact arrives on a planet where its inhabitants look the same as him. They mistake him for their leader and start worshipping him. The planet is then attacked by Harakiri Seppukumaru. Goemon Impact then flies his friends to the planet in order to save his newfound followers.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nKurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 described the game as \"the best of all of the Mystical Ninja games\" with excellent graphics and sound quality.\nPanda of Consoles + described it as a fun game with all the ingredients from the previous games of the series that made it successful, with the addition of a fun 2 player mode. However, a second opinion given by Niico in the same review said that the game was not of the quality of Donkey Kong Country 2 or Mario, and that it lacked inspiration and was hurt by platforming sections that required millimeter precision. He also said that fans of the series would like the game, but he personally had threw in the towel and was not impressed.\n\n\n== References ==",

The final was contested as a single match between Al-Ahed from Lebanon and Central Coast Mariners from Australia. The match was played at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex in Muscat on 5 May 2024.\nCentral Coast Mariners won the final 1–0 to crown their maiden title and become the first Australian club to win the competition. By also winning the competition, Australia became the first and only nation in the AFC to have had clubs winning both the AFC Champions League and AFC Cup, after Western Sydney Wanderers' win of the 2014 AFC Champions League. It was also the third, and final time, that a club from outside West Asia had won the competition.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n== Venue ==\n\nThe match was originally scheduled to be hosted by Al-Ahed at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium in Beirut, Lebanon; however, due to the ongoing Lebanese liquidity crisis, combined with the ongoing fears of spillover from the Israel–Hamas war, the match was instead played in a neutral ground, which resulted in the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex being selected as the home stadium of the Lebanese side.\n\n\n== Road to the final ==\n\nNote: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\n\n\n== Format ==\nThe final was played as a single match, with the host team (winners of the West Asia Zonal final) alternated from the previous season's final.\nIf the game would be tied after regulation time, the winning team would be decided by extra time and, if necessary, a penalty shoot-out.\n\n\n== Match ==\n\n\n=== Details ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAFC Cup, the-AFC.com\nAFC Cup 2024, stats.the-AFC.com",

The composition of the conference and the schedule were announced on 15 February 2024. The conference games began on 4 May and ended on 12 May 2024.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nDespite being considered the weakest team, the Rivers Hoopers came out with three straight wins. The Hoopers were the first team to clinch a playoffs spot on the fifth gameday. US Monastir, the 2022 BAL champions, lost their first three games. They became the first former BAL champions to lose four games in a row, dating back to the previous season. The game between APR and Rivers Hoopers on May 11 was the first double-overtime game in BAL history. On May 9, Mike Fofana scored a buzzer-beater game winner to give AS Douanes the win over Rivers Hoopers.\nComing into the final game day on May 12, the last two games decided the last two playoffs spots. On the last gameday, US Monastir qualified after finishing with a 3–3 record. AS Douanes and APR battled for the last playoffs spot, with the winner advancing, and AS Douanes eventually secured its spot.\n\n\n== Standings ==\n\n\n== Games ==\n\n\n== Player statistics ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Fix is an English detective from Scotland Yard and suspects that Phileas Fogg is the thief who robbed £50,000 from the Bank of England.\nVerne was inspired by the character Javert from the novel Les Misérables when creating the character Fix.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe is an English detective who attracted by the bounty offered for the capture of the thief of the Bank of England, he is responsible for finding the thief. The description of the latter quickly makes him suspect, upon seeing Phileas Fogg, that the two men are one and that the gentleman only accepted the bet of going around the world in a given time only to hide his escape from the police. Endowed with extraordinary obstinacy, Fix waits for the traveler firmly in Suez. But the arrest warrant not having arrived, he decides to follow Fogg on his journey. Trying by all means to delay Fogg, he goes so far as to get Passepartout drunk in Hong Kong and rejoices in the storm that is assailing the Rangoon, despite the seasickness he feels from it.\nChange of tactics on American soil. Fix does everything necessary to make the trip faster, sensing that the time to return to Britain is approaching. There, he will finally be able to arrest the gentleman without having to wait for a arrest warrant.\nThroughout this journey, Fogg does not seem to notice the detective's schemes and obligingly offers him, at each stage, his help to obtain a place on the ships he borrows. Certainly, sometimes Fix sometimes wonders about the attitude of Fogg, imperturbably continuing his jounaley around the earth, and has doubts about his guilt in the theft of the Bank. However, his professional conscience quickly takes over and, at the end of the journey, when Phileas Fogg discovers that he only has a few moments to take a train, he stops him. But, a few hours later, the detective returns with apologies, having learned that the real thief had just been apprehended. Later, when he realizes his error in calculating the time and his victory, Fogg, unable to blame the detective, will send him a bonus of five hundred pounds.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nClaude Lengrand.

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "In late 2008 and early 2009, nine people died and at least 714 people fell ill due to food poisoning from eating products containing contaminated peanuts supplied by the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA). The real numbers were believed to be much higher, since for every reported case of salmonellosis, on average, another 38 or so cases go unreported, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A combination of epidemiological analysis and laboratory testing by state officials in Minnesota and Connecticut, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC confirmed that the sources of the outbreak of illnesses caused by Salmonella typhimurium were peanut butter, peanut paste, and peanut meal produced by the PCA at its Blakely, Georgia, processing plant.\nOn February 7, 2009, Oregon officials confirmed the first case of salmonellosis in a dog that had eaten biscuits contaminated with the PCA-produced peanut products.\nIn January 2009, the company issued a statement categorically denying the allegations; in January 2009, it shut down production and laid off 50 employees at the Blakely plant.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Aflatoxin suits ===\n\nPCA was sued in 1990 by the American Candy Company after the FDA discovered that PCA's peanut butter exceeded the FDA tolerance level for aflatoxin, a mold-derived toxin common to peanut production; American Candy had turned the peanut butter into 8,000 unshipped cases of \"kisses\" for Wal-Mart. Another lawsuit was brought by Zachary Confections Inc. of Frankfort, Indiana, in 1991, after a 40,020-pound shipment of nuts from PCA was also found to have an unacceptably high level of aflatoxin.\n\n\n=== Nestlé inspection ===\nIn January 2006, Nestlé completed an onsite audit of PCA's Plainview plant, and gave it a \"Does Not Meet Standards\" score on nearly all 40 inspection areas. Months after, PCA hired Kenneth Kendrick as assistant plant manager at the Plainview plant.\n\n\n=== FDA oversight before 2008 ===\n\nIn 2001, FDA inspectors also found that products from the Blakely plant were potentially exposed to insecticides, according to a report obtained by the Associated Press.\nAccording to Virginia state inspection records, the PCA blanching operations in Suffolk, Virginia, had some of the same food safety problems that would be found in the company's Georgia plant (see below). Inspection in 2008 found mold on \"totes\" holding peanuts, counted 43 mouse droppings on the floor, and saw a live bird walking and flying inside the warehouse.\n\n\n== Recall ==\nThis contamination event triggered the most extensive food recall ever in U.S. history. As of April 22, 2009, it involved at least 361 companies and 3,913 different products manufactured using PCA ingredients. The recall included everything produced at the Blakely plant since January 1, 2007, as well as everything ever produced at the Plainview, Texas, plant. Products supplied for some school lunches were pulled, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) even recalled emergency meals sent after a massive ice storm. (Since the storm left many without power, the United States Postal Service went door-to-door in Kentucky to warn residents and hand out 600,000 flyers from FEMA.) Food banks nationwide had to discard thousands of pounds of food in time of high demand from millions of U.S. families in need.\nThe recall did not involve major-brand peanut butters, since PCA primarily served only low-budget and institutional providers, but many consumers reacted by avoiding peanut products altogether, driving down the sales of all brands of peanut butter by nearly 25%.\nThis caused great harm to the industry and farmers, already suffering from low prices due to the 2008 bumper crop and the deepening economic crisis. Losses to the U.S. peanut industry because of this outbreak were estimated to be $1 billion.\n\n\n== 2009 investigations ==\n\n\n=== Georgia ===\n\n\n==== Journalistic ====\nFollowing initial reporting of the contamination's source, reporters and investigators began taking a careful look at the sites run by PCA. The Washington Post reported on February 14, 2009, the view of David Brooks, a buyer for a snack company that had visited PCA facilities in the mid-1980s (when PCA was under Hugh Parnell's control), that \"everybody in the peanut industry\" in the states involved (Georgia, Virginia, and Texas) knew of the serious sanitation issues associated with PCA; Brooks went on to state that PCA was \"a time bomb waiting to go off.\"\nFormer employees interviewed by the Chicago Tribune stated that conditions in the plant were \"filthy and nasty\", and that they would never eat the peanut butter or allow their children to eat it. One employee remembered seeing a family of baby mice in a tote of peanuts, and others recalled having to step over standing water inside the building after heavy rain. Another former employee told CBS News that he saw a rat dry-roasting in a peanut area. Another told ABC News that workers had no idea the company had positive Salmonella tests because \"that information is not for the average employee to see.\"\n\n\n==== Food and Drug Administration ====\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) inspectors reported, following a two-week inspection of the Blakely, Georgia, plant in January 2009, that the company had information that its peanut-butter products were tainted with Salmonella, but shipped them anyway after \"retesting\" them. This occurred at least 12 times in 2007 and 2008. FDA inspectors also found mold growing on the plant's ceiling and walls, foot-long gaps in its roof, dead insects near peanuts, and holes in the plant big enough for rodents to enter. Inspectors found that the company also did not clean its equipment after finding contamination, and did not properly segregate raw and finished products. In 2007, the company shipped chopped peanuts on two occasions even after Salmonella was confirmed by private lab tests. The company had previously refused to divulge production test records until federal officials invoked the food safety provisions of a federal antiterrorism law (the 2002 Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act). As a result of this refusal and the incident in general, the Georgia State Senate passed a bill requiring peanut product manufacturers to report any contamination within 24 hours, failing which felony charges would result.\nOn February 6, 2009, the FDA reported that the company shipped tainted products under three conditions: (1) without retesting, (2) before the retest results came back from an outside company, and (3) after a second test showed no bacterial contamination. In all three cases, the initial positive result means that the product should have been destroyed.\nDocuments released February 11 by the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee showed that the company shipped products to customers even before receiving results of Salmonella tests, and selectively chose laboratiries to mask contamination.\n\n\n=== Texas ===\nThe company had operated a plant in Gorman, where the company originally started in 1977. David Brooks, the snack food company buyer interviewed by The Washington Post after the Salmonella outbreak, said that he inspected this plant three times on behalf of his company in the mid-1980s to determine whether to buy peanuts from PCA. The plant failed his private inspection each time for what he called \"just filthy\" conditions, including dusty beams, leaky roofs, and birds flying through the building. The Gorman operations transferred to Plainview when Hale County officials issued $2 million in tax-free revenue bonds to help the company convert a long vacant Jimmy Dean sausage factory into a peanut plant. Local officials, including a county health inspector, toured the new plant and approved its opening, although the state said it never knew the plant existed. The plant was located along a major highway, across from a large Wal-Mart distribution center; it had four highly visible signs in the front and a billboard bearing a picture of a peanut. A state inspector who drove by the plant \"a few times\" on his way to other inspections never stopped because it was not on his list. State officials said the company was solely to blame for failing to obtain the food manufacturer's license when the Plainview plant opened.\nThe company's plant in Plainview opened in March 2005 and employed 30 people, but was never licensed in that state as a food manufacturing facility; the state had not done any inspections until the problems with the Georgia plant became news. The Texas plant blanched, dry- and oil-roasted, and chopped peanuts, then shipped them to food companies across the country. The plant had been certified for organic production in November 2005, based on what state officials later called incomplete information obtained by an inspector with the Texas Department of Agriculture. However, the company failed to apply for a Texas health certificate, which would have triggered a visit by state inspectors. State health officials were not aware the plant existed until the company released a list of its plants around the country.\nThe Texas inspection in January 2009 found some unsanitary conditions, such as unclean sections of a peanut-roasting line. It also reported that several internal company laboratory tests dating back to November had found no Salmonella or other contaminants. However, on February 10, 2009, company officials announced that the Texas plant had been shut down, after samples taken on February 4 tested positive for Salmonella. Former workers at the Texas plant interviewed by The New York Times said that the facility was \"disgusting\". It said the plant shared many of the problems found in the plant in Georgia, including a badly leaking roof and rodent infestation. A former plant manager told Good Morning America that he had repeatedly complained to the company owner, Stewart Parnell, about unsanitary conditions, including \"water leaking off a roof and bird feces washing in\", but Parnell would not authorise money for necessary repairs.\nOn February 12, 2009, Texan health officials ordered an unprecedented recall of all products ever shipped from the Texas plant since it opened in 2005, after discovering that the plant's air-handling system was drawing in debris from a crawl space containing \"dead rodents, rodent excrement and bird feathers\" into production areas. State health officials said they issued the sweeping recall because they did not know how long the unsanitary conditions had existed at the plant.\n\n\n=== Virginia ===\nThe PCA's peanut blanching operation in Suffolk, Virginia, employed 13 workers and was shut down the day PCA filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\n== Criminal proceedings ==\n\n\n=== Georgia investigation ===\nTommy Irvin, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Agriculture (GDA), requested criminal investigation of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) as the organization responsible for inspections contracted by the FDA. GDA and GBI officials had said they would consider pursuing manslaughter charges if federal authorities did not take up the case. On January 30, 2009, federal health officials announced that a criminal investigation had been launched by the U.S. Justice Department for possible prosecution under provisions of the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. On February 4, Georgia officials said they would not prosecute the company, because the two state laws under consideration (reckless conduct and adulteration of food) were only misdemeanors and would only allow for minor penalties. Vernon Keenan, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, said: \"Any potential prosecution is most appropriately handled at the federal level\".\n\n\n=== Federal prosecution ===\nOn February 9, 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it had joined with the FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI) as part of a criminal investigation of the company. Search warrants were executed on the Blakely plant, as well as PCA's corporate headquarters in Lynchburg. Following a raid by its agents, the Federal Agents sealed off the Blakely plant. On February 21, 2013, four former officials of the company were named in a 75-count indictment on charges related to Salmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut products. The former processing plant manager for Peanut Corporation, Samuel Lightsey, reached a plea agreement on May 8, 2014. Lightsey was then available to the government as a witness at the trial, scheduled to begin in July 2014.\n\n\n=== Convictions ===\nParnell and his brother were convicted in September 2014 of 71 criminal counts, including conspiracy, fraud and other federal charges. In July 2015, Federal authorities recommended a sentence of life imprisonment for Stewart Parnell. Both Daniel Kilgore and Samuel Lightsey (both former plant managers at PCA) pleaded guilty on their related charges and became government witnesses in the case, providing testimony during the 2014 trial, for consideration of limited sentencing.\n\n\n=== Sentencing ===\nIn July 2015, federal authorities recommended a sentence of life imprisonment for Parnell. He faced a statutory maximum of 804 years in prison. On September 21, 2015, Parnell was sentenced to 28 years in prison, the longest punishment ever handed out to a producer in a U.S. foodborne illness case. His brother, Michael Parnell, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and the plant's former quality assurance manager Mary Wilkerson was sentenced to five years. On October 1, 2015, Samuel Lightsey was sentenced to three years in prison and Daniel Kilgore was sentenced to six years in prison. Both men had agreed to cooperate with the government in exchange for leniency.\nU.S. District Judge W. Louis Sands stated during sentencing, \"We place faith that no one would intentionally ship products to market that are contaminated ... Consumers are at the mercy of food producers for the safety of the products. These acts [of the convicted PCA executives] were driven by profit and the protection of profit … thus greed.\" Sands told Stewart Parnell that he had \"taken risks for years,\" that they were \"eventually discovered and traced back\" to his corporation, and that, unfortunately, \"thousands of people suffered and nine died\" from Parnell's knowing disregard for public health and safety.\n\n\n==== Imprisonments ====\nStewart Parnell is currently imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Institution, Hazelton, Michael Parnell is imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix, Daniel Kilgore served his sentence in the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta until he was released on April 13, 2020, Mary Wilkerson served her sentence in the Federal Correctional Institution, Tallahassee until she was released on February 9, 2020, and Samuel Lightsey served his sentence in the Federal Correctional Institution, Forrest City until he was released on September 29, 2017.\n\n\n== Bankruptcy ==\nOn February 13, 2009, less than 24 hours after the Texas recall, Peanut Corporation of America announced it was permanently halting operations and filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Bankruptcy lawyer Andrew Goldstein said that the company had considered filing for Chapter 11, but decided to liquidate because all of its plants had been shut down and there was no way it could carry on business. Consumers Union criticised the move, saying that the bankruptcy filing would shield the company from liability suits, although in reality, the bankruptcy filing merely delays any claims against the company.\n\n\n== Other federal action ==\nParnell served on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Peanut Standards Board, which sets quality and handling standards for peanuts. He was first appointed by Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns to the position in 2005, and was reappointed for another term that would have expired in 2011, but on February 5, 2009, the USDA announced that the new Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack had removed Parnell from the board.\nOn February 5, 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that Peanut Corporation of America and a subsidiary, Tidewater Blanching LLC, were banned from all federal government contracts and subcontracts for one year, saying the company: \"lacks business integrity and business honesty, which seriously and directly hinders its ability to do business with the federal government.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPeanut Corporation of America E-Mails\nPeanut Butter Product Recalls (2009-01-29) - FDA\nMultistate Outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium Infections Linked to Peanut Butter, 2008-2009 (FINAL UPDATE) - CDC\nPeanut Corporation of America\nPeanut Corporation of America\nPCA criminal case\nPCA trial\nPCA criminal appeal\nStewart Parnell | Fortune Archived September 24, 2015, at the Wayback Machine\nPeanut Corporation of America — Blakely, Georgia Plant — archived from 2009.",

        "content": "Achille Germain was a French road and track cyclist.\nA professional from 1905 to 1919, he won many local events but also shone on the velodromes of Paris, where he gained a great reputation in middle-distance races, notably taking third place in the French championship in 1914. Second in the Six Days of Toulouse in 1906, in partnership with Jean Gauban, he also participated twice in the Six Days of New York and took part in the first Six Days of Paris in 1913.\nGermain, nicknamed “Germain de la Flèche” by his followers, also competed in road races, taking part in the 1908 Tour de France, where he placed 16th, achieving his best result with an eighth-place finish on the tenth stage to Bordeaux. \nThe following year, he won a stage in the Circuit de la Loire and finished second overall.\nMobilized as a corporal cyclist with the 317th Infantry regiment during the First World War, he retired from the sport in 1919 following an injury sustained during the conflict. He retired to La Flèche to run a cycle repair shop and became so involved in local life that he was elected town councilor in his final years.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early cycling career ===\nAchille Germain was born in Beaupréau, Maine-et-Loire, on May 5, 1884, but his family moved to La Flèche, Sarthe, when he was still very young. His beginnings in cycling were fairly modest. He took part in his first races in his adopted town in 1902, at the July 14th races held on the Promenade du Pré. He came second in the bonus race.\nThe following year, he joined the newly-formed Union vélocipédique fléchoise (UVF), and at the same July 14 meeting, came second in the speed final and third in the bonus race. On September 20, he finished second in the 100-kilometer UVF Cup behind Mareau from Mance, a member of the Union Auto-Cycliste de la Sarthe.\n\nLike many racers of the time, Germain took part in both road and track events. On April 4, 1904, at the opening of the Fléchois velodrome on rue Belleborde, he scored his first victory in the middle-distance race, which he won by half a lap over his rivals. The same day, he reached the final of the sprint race, where he was narrowly beaten by Tubières from Mance. He went on to achieve good results on the Fléchoise track, finishing third in the Sarthe departmental championship and then in the La Flèche championship in June, and fourth in the regional final the following month, an event won by Nantes rider Hardy.\nOn July 31, Germain scored a prestigious success on the track of the Buffalo Velodrome in Neuilly, clearly dominating the 10-kilometer bonus race. During the event, he won the last five of the ten intermediate sprints, pocketing a ten-franc bonus each time. Back in La Flèche in September, he took second place in the UVF speed championship behind clubmate Albert Leroy, who had just taken part in the Tour de France.\n\n\n== Professional racer ==\n\n\n=== A benchmark in track racing (1905–1907) ===\nIn 1905, Germain, then a third category professional racer, established himself as one of the best cyclists in his region. On the Fléchois velodrome on March 26, he won the speed event, the 45-lap race behind the bike, and the bonus race, a domination he repeated on April 24, when he won the Sarthe departmental speed championship, held on the same track, as well as the 25 km race and the bonus race. At the end of the summer, he scored two further successes, with the Grand Prix de Tours on September 9 and the Grand Prix de Montluçon the following day, both in the middle-distance race. He also distinguished himself in more modest competitions, such as the 4-kilometer cantonal race he won in Verron in early October 5, or at folklore events: the Pinder Circus was visiting La Flèche, and Germain competed with several Fléchois amateurs on the “Canadian track”, a 6.5-meter-diameter construction of wooden rungs spaced ten centimeters apart and inclined at 75 degrees. After an unsuccessful first attempt, he achieved the best performance of the participants, completing eight laps of the track.\nDuring the winter of 1905–1906, Germain trained alongside the best specialists of the day on the Vélodrome d'Hiver track in Paris. Though he could see the gap existing between him and those in the lead, Germain's persistence in training was noticed. Along with Georges Parent, he was chosen to join the coaching team of Henri Cornet, winner of the 1904 Tour de France, in a 50-kilometer tandem match against Karl Ingold. Cornet won by nine laps. At the same meeting, Germain made his mark as an individual in the 15-kilometer race behind motorcycles. Third behind Paul Rugère and Anton Jaeck, his offensive behavior throughout the race was praised by the spectators. On February 18, he teamed up with Denmark's Axel Hansen in the American-style Twelve Hours race, in which the two competitors took turns at will. At the end of the race, fourteen teams were still classified in the same lap: victory was therefore decided over six laps between the best sprinters in each team. Hansen initially placed fourth, but the commissaries were slow to validate the results after a crash on the last lap. The race was eventually canceled. On March 4, a meeting was held at the La Flèche Velodrome, bringing together several well-known riders. On his home turf, Germain took third place in the bonus race behind Charles Vanoni and Victor Thuau, before losing out to César Simar, Olympic medalist two years earlier, in the 10-kilometer race behind the bike.\n\nThe outdoor season brought him many successes. On April 23, 1906, in La Flèche, he won the 15-kilometer race behind motorcycles ahead of Arthur Pasquier, then set the track record over 10 kilometers. The following week, in Tours, he won the 50-kilometer race behind motorcycles, again ahead of Pasquier, then shared victory with Jean Gougoltz in the Grand Prix du Conseil Général in Nantes on May 6. His performances attracted the goodwill of the newspaper L'Auto, which had already dubbed him “Germain de la Flèche”: “The middle-distance race went very easily to the Fléchois crack, Germain. This fellow is about to play a major role\". On June 3, he discovered the Parc des Princes track and took third place in the 30-kilometer race behind Antoine Dussot and Henri Lautier, which earned him selection by the organizers of the Grand Prix de Paris. Thanks to the financial support of Viscount de Lesseville, head of the Union Vélocipédique Fléchoise, he was able to employ several trainers to compete in the one-hour race behind tandems. Competing against two of the best cyclists of the time, Henri Cornet and René Pottier, he was soundly beaten, but as with every one of his outings, his attitude was widely praised by the specialists, and Germain became one of the public's most popular riders. At the beginning of July, at the Vélodrome Buffalo, he failed in his attempt to beat the world record for 10 kilometers without trainers, held by Lucien Petit-Breton, but a few days later he scored a clear success over 15 kilometers behind motorcycles on the same track. On July 15, in La Flèche, in front of an enthusiastic crowd, he won two of the three events organized and took the overall victory. At the end of August, he was the only rider to hold off César Simar over 30 kilometers at Le Buffalo, then clearly dominated Émile Bouhours over the same distance at Tours in early September.\nGermain then took part in the Six Jours de Toulouse, the first race of its kind in Europe, held on the Bazacle velodrome, where he teamed up with local rider Jean Gauban. The duo achieved a promising second place, second only to brothers Émile and Léon Georget. Throughout the event, the Fléchois rider was extremely active, winning numerous prizes, including those for the 47th and 49th hours. On his return, he was triumphantly welcomed back to La Flèche. A few days later, he was sent to Toul barracks, where he was to perform his military service with the 153rd infantry regiment.\nGermain was rarely granted leave, but managed to take part in a few races in 1907: beaten by Arthur Pasquier over 40 kilometers in Tours on April 21, he took his revenge and beat him the following week in La Flèche at the Grand Prix du Printemps.\n\n\n=== Participation in the Tour de France (1908) ===\n\nReleased from military service on March 1, 1908, Achille Germain wanted to take part in more road races: he considered taking part in Paris–Roubaix, but eventually had to give up18. On the velodrome track in La Flèche, in early April, he won the Sarthe speed championship, then finished second to Pasquier in the Grand Prix du Printemps. In May, on the same track, he won a 12-hour race by a clear 16-lap margin over his nearest rival. A few days later, he came second in the 40-kilometer Grand Prix d'Angers with trainers and announced his entry in the Tour de France. It was the only Tour he contested during his career.\nHe had a difficult start to the race: at best, he finished 22nd on the fifth stage from Lyon to Grenoble and was 25th overall on the evening of the sixth stage to Nice. However, race conditions were very tough at the start of the Tour, and only 45 of the 114 entries were still in contention. He went on to achieve some convincing results: 19th in Nîmes and 15th in Toulouse, 17th in Bayonne, and 8th in Bordeaux, having been among the frontrunners throughout the race. Germain finished the Tour de France with three 12th places and one 14th. In the end, he came 16th with 236 points, 200 behind the winner Lucien Petit-Breton. This encouraging participation earned him the congratulations of many specialists, such as L'Auto journalist Charles Ravaud, who considered him capable of achieving excellent results if he chose to devote himself even more to the road. His participation in the Grande Boucle further boosted his popularity: he was carried in triumph on his return to La Flèche station and welcomed into town by over 2,000 people.\n\n\n=== Success on the Road and Six Days of New York (1909) ===\n\nResting during the winter, he made his comeback on April 25, 1909, at the La Flèche velodrome and retained his Sarthe speed champion title. Beaten in Angers by Daniel Lavalade over 40 kilometers behind motorcycles, he distinguished himself at the end of May by taking second place in the Circuit de la Loire road race, run over two stages, having won the first in Loudun. Invited to take part in the eighth stage of the Wolber Grand Prix, organized by Peugeot on June 13 between Paris and La Flèche, Germain placed sixth and, according to L'Auto, earned “his stripes as a great road racer”. He was also invited to take part in the ninth stage to Nantes, where he finished fourth before being downgraded for a course error.\nDuring the summer, he opted out of the Tour de France to compete in a series of lucrative track races. Forced to retire from a 24-hour race in Marseille, he teamed up with Bouteiller for a 12-hour race in Toulouse, taking second place after a hard-fought battle with Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq. In September, he was one of the main favorites for the Bol d'or, held on the track of the Buffalo velodrome. In the lead after the first four hours of the race, run without trainers, he suffered a serious setback and lost contact: he was only in seventh and last place after seven hours. In the last quarter of the race, Germain overtook two rivals and finally finished fifth with a total of 681.6 kilometers, a long way from three-time winner Léon Georget.\nGermain made his return to the road at the end of September with Paris–Tours. His eighteenth-place finish was anecdotal, just as his last few outings on the track were hardly conclusive: he failed twice in his attempt to set the record for the hour without a trainer at La Flèche. In early December, however, he was selected for the Six Days of New York, one of the world's most famous races, where he teamed up with British runner Reginald Shirley. In the 50th minute of the race, Shirley caused a heavy crash when he passed the baton to Germain, who was hit in the right leg. The duo conceded a lap to the other teams, and despite Germain's best efforts, were unable to catch up. At the end of the first day of racing, Shirley retired, suffering from stomach pains. Germain was joined by the Italian Egisto Carapezzi, whose partner had also been forced to withdraw. By the regulations, the new crew received a one-lap penalty, but this was nothing compared to the number of laps Carapezzi regularly conceded during his stints. The duo were 21 laps down after 34 hours of racing. Redoubling their efforts to overcome the deficit, the two men suffered a breakdown at the same time and interrupted their race for two hours. At the end of the fifth day, Carapezzi gave up, and despite Germain's desire to continue the race, the judges deemed him too retarded to continue, his deficit having risen to almost 900 laps.\n\n\n=== Middle-distance specialist (1910–1913) ===\n\nAt the beginning of 1910, Germain once again gave priority to the track. He obtained convincing results at the local level but struggled to confirm his performance in the major Parisian events. In May, however, he competed in the French road championships with coaches. Dropped after the first few kilometers, he eventually came tenth. After a detour to the track and a success in Brest over 25 kilometers at the expense of César Simar, he returned to the road to take tenth place in Paris-Le Mans. During the summer, Germain took several places of honor on the velodromes, coming second in the Grand Prix d'inauguration du vélodrome d'Angers, the Challenge Cointreau in the same town, and the Huit heures de Tours, which earned him selection for the Bol d'or. Ill and suffering from the pace set by Léon Georget, he retired shortly after the halfway mark. As in the previous year, he was selected to take part in the Six Days of New York, this time in partnership with the Belgian Verlinden. The two men never found their rhythm and retired after just eight hours of racing.\nIn 1911, Germain opened a repair shop in La Flèche for bicycles of all makes. At the same time, the J.B. Louvet team hired him to race on the road, but after his withdrawal from Paris-Tours, he gave up on Paris-Roubaix, preferring to take part in a track event in Angers. Germain also became a race organizer, setting up the Grand Prix Jean-Baptiste Louvet in La Flèche on May 7. The 130-kilometer road race, open only to members of the Union velocipédique de France, crisscrossed the region's roads, passing through Le Lude and Baugé.\n\nAfter several middle-distance successes in Angers and Nantes, notably at the expense of American Woody Headspeth, he returned to the road for Paris-Brest-Paris in the road-tourist category. A crash before Rennes destroyed his bike, and Germain had to walk the 14 kilometers to the city. Unable to repair it, he gave up. His winter season began with several places of honor, but it was on December 17, at the Vélodrome d'Hiver, that he won a convincing victory in the Prix Robl, a middle-distance race run over 25 kilometers and organized in tribute to the German champion Thaddäus Robl, who died in a plane crash. Germain not only raced for his account but also regularly acted as a trainer for other riders, as in the Prix de Madison Square at the beginning of the following January, in which American Joe Fogler owed his victory in part to him.\n\nDuring the 1912 season, Germain concentrated mainly on middle-distance running. He racked up successes in Rouen, Paris, and Angers, usually against second-rate opponents. On June 9, on the Parc des Princes track, he took fourth place in the French middle-distance championship, running over 100 kilometers, finishing fifteen laps behind the winner Paul Guignard and seven off the podium. A week later, in Nantes, he finally beat worthy rivals Émile Bouhours and César Simar in a 50-kilometer race. In August, he came third in the Critérium de demi-fond at Le Buffalo, then won the Le Mans meeting on the Jacobins Velodrome. On September 15, he suffered a severe setback in the Grand Prix de France de Vitesse at the Parc des Princes, failing in the heats, but returned to the limelight at the end of the year with a convincing victory in the Prix Stocks, run over 40 kilometers at the Vélodrome d'Hiver. Danish rider Herman Kjeldsen was the only rider to stand up to him in this event, but Germain was the strongest and displayed a radiant form that earned him selection for the first Six Jours de Paris, on January 13, 1913.\nOn the Vél d'Hiv track, during the first two days, Germain, in partnership with Édouard Léonard, animated the race by consistently leading the pack, but the two riders began to lose contact after the 50th hour of the race. The duo finished ninth, six laps behind the winners, but Germain and Léonard were among the race's top prizewinners. After the race, Germain's popularity soared once again, enabling him to negotiate higher participation rates at various velodrome meetings. After successes in Angers in March, he made a strong impression on April 13, winning a 30-kilometer race ahead of Daniel Lavalade and César Simar at the Buffalo. A journalist from L'Auto declared: \"The middle-distance race has returned to the runner with courage personified. My name is Achille Germain.\" Considered an outsider for the French middle-distance championship, he took fourth place, a long way behind the winner Paul Guignard. At the Grand Prix de Paris, he came second in the 50-kilometer race, well ahead of Georges Sérès, but containing the return of several well-known runners. He concluded the season with another place of honor, finishing second in the Grand Prix de clôture de Roubaix.\n\nAs in the previous year, Germain teamed up with Édouard Léonard for the Six Jours de Paris, which started on January 12, 1914. After Léonard dropped out on the second day of the race, Germain teamed up with Charles Meurger and came within two laps of the leaders. Le Fléchois kept the duo afloat, but Meurger, more of a sprint specialist, conceded several laps and eventually retired after the 61st hour. Germain continued the race with a third team-mate, Alfred Beyl, but it was he who finally retired after 102 hours, having won numerous primes. After a series of fine performances at the Paris meetings and a major success at the Grand Prix du Printemps de Limoges, he achieved the best result of his career at the French middle-distance championship on July 19, finishing third in the event, won once again by Paul Guignard.\n\n\n=== World War I and end of career (1914–1919) ===\nA few days later, the First World War broke out and, like his competitors, Germain was mobilized. Assigned to the 317th Infantry Regiment as a corporal cyclist, he was in charge of transporting mail by bicycle. During the war, however, he took part in several races on leave. On November 19, 1916, he took part in a 400-lap American-style race at the Vélodrome d'Hiver. Teaming up with Marius Chocque, he came tenth. In December 1917, on the same track, he won the Prix de la Capitale over 30 kilometers, and the following year he won the Prix d'Avril middle-distance race at the Vel' d'Hiv'. He then beat a Belgian runner in a middle-distance match held at the Beaulieu velodrome in Le Mans.\nDemobilized at the beginning of 1919, Germain returned to racing more intensively. Third in the one-hour Trophée de Paris in May, he won the Grand Handicap de demi-fond at the Parc des Princes on July 6. Although he seemed to be in full possession of his powers, he had to put an end to his career because of a groin injury, contracted during the war, which eventually reopened.\n\n\n=== Reconversion and end of life ===\nGermain then retired to La Flèche to run his cycle repair shop. Very involved in local life, he invited his friend Robert Spears, world track speed champion, to lay a wreath at the cemetery to commemorate the Armistice on November 11, 1920. In 1922, to pay tribute to the veterans of the Great War, he inaugurated a commemorative plaque on the birthplace of Fléchois aviator Charles Godefroy, made famous by his flight under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on August 7, 1919. Two years later, a Poilus banquet was organized on his initiative in the ballroom of the Hôtel du Cheval Blanc. On this occasion, he donated one of his racing bicycles, and offered to the winner of a tombola organized for the benefit of the veterans. Germain was elected vice-chairman of the town's Comité des Fêtes in March 1926.\nBut he didn't give up cycling. In 1920, he took on the role of motorcycle coach to Tunisian Ali Neffati, and in the same year, together with his friends, set up a new multi-sports club, \"La Flèche-Sportive\". Among other achievements, this club organized a road race, Paris-La Flèche, which ran for three consecutive editions. At the same time, Germain was involved in the construction of a new stadium and velodrome to replace Belleborde. After several months of negotiation, work began on a plot of land adjacent to the Route d'Angers: the stadium was inaugurated in November 1921 for a soccer match, while the track was built in early 1922 thanks to the financial support of several great champions, including Robert Spears, Oscar Egg, Maurice Brocco, aviator Georges Kirsch and boxer Georges Carpentier. In 1925, Germain set up the Printania restaurant and dance hall opposite the new stadium, which quickly became one of the city's most popular entertainment venues.\nIn April 1931, he stood as an Independent Republican candidate in the municipal by-elections in La Flèche. Obtaining 1,111 votes, the highest total, he was among the five newly elected. He also ran in the 1932 legislative elections. With 4,108 votes, he came third, more than 5,600 votes behind the incumbent Radical candidate Jean Montigny, who was elected in the first round.\nRe-elected to the La Flèche town council in 1935, still as an independent, he served until his death on April 12, 1938, at the age of 54. He is buried in the Saint-Thomas cemetery. On May 22, 1978, the town of La Flèche paid tribute to him by naming the street of a newly built housing estate after him.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== On the track ===\nThroughout his career, Germain won numerous victories in races of varying importance organized by different velodromes.

        "content": "Cold War Liberation: The Soviet Union and the Collapse of the Portuguese Empire in Africa, 1961–1975 is a book by Natalia Telepneva. It was published by the University of North Carolina Press in 2022. The book explores the Soviet Union's involvement in African anti-colonial movements, specifically in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau. Drawing upon newly available archival sources and interviews with key figures, Telepneva sheds light on the intricate relationships between African liberation leaders and Soviet bureaucrats, highlighting the agency of the former in enlisting Soviet support. Through a reinterpretation of historical events, the book contributes to discussions surrounding Cold War policy-making in the Global South, offering insights into the dynamics of superpower rivalry in sub-Saharan Africa during the mid-20th century.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn 2 May 2023, The History and Public Policy Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars hosted a seminar dedicated to discussing the book. Telepneva as well as two panelist, Eric Arnesen and Christian Ostermann, discussed the book for about ninety minutes. Discussing her book during the panel, Telepneva said that \"much of the book is devoted to explaining how these African revolutionaries navigated both local politics and internal rivalries\" all while keeping and cultivating stronger ties with major international donors like the Soviet Union.\nThe book was published in January 2022 online with the support of the Andrew Mellon Foundation and in hardback by University of North Carolina Press in the 'New Histories of the Cold War\" series in June 2022. It is available in open access.\nThe book launch took place on the 25 April 2022 in a conversation with Arne Westad and David Anderson.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book examines Soviet engagement with African revolutionary movements within the context of the Global Cold War, highlighting the role of ideology and personal relationships in Soviet foreign policy. Telepneva draws from newly declassified Soviet archives and oral history to argue that ideological motivations, alongside pragmatic considerations, drove Soviet interactions in Portuguese Africa. The book explores the involvement of Soviet officials, emphasizing the significance of personal connections with African leaders in shaping policy decisions. The book also reconstructs the dynamics of Soviet involvement in the Angolan Civil War in 1974–75.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nDmitry Asinovskiy thought that Telepneva's narrative emphasized personal relationships and ideological affinities in shaping Soviet policies towards African revolutionaries, yet overlooked the bureaucratic processes within the Soviet system. Asinovskiy judged the book as \"an essential contribution to the historiography of Soviet attempts to engage with the decolonising world.\"\nErin Kimball Damman explained how in her book, Telepneva demonstrated the cautious approach of the Soviet Union post-Carnation Revolution and sheds light on its cooperation with Cuba in arming the MPLA in Angola. Damman thought that despite a complex narrative involving multiple political actors, the book provides valuable insights into Cold War dynamics and Soviet strategies in Africa.\nAlexander Hill praised the book for its significant contribution to studying the Soviet support for national liberation movements during the Cold War, particularly focusing on the collapse of the Portuguese Empire in Africa. Hill highlighted Telepneva's emphasis on \"African agency\" in interactions with the Soviet Union, showcasing the complexity of relationships beyond traditional diplomatic narratives.\nBenedito Machava highlighted how the book reveals the pivotal role of African leaders in securing support for decolonization, emphasizing their agency in navigating global power dynamics. Machave thought that while the book is predominantly focused on male figures, it offers valuable insights into the complex diplomatic maneuvers that shaped the decolonization process in Lusophone Africa.\nIn his review, Maxim Matusevich paised the book's exploration of Soviet involvement in Africa during the Cold War. Matusevich highlighted Telepneva's emphasis on personal encounters and connections within the larger geopolitical context, shedding light on the complexities of Soviet foreign policy and the challenges of understanding African agency. The review underscored Telepneva's examination of the role of individuals, including the \"Cominternians\" and the \"War Generation,\" in shaping Soviet-African relations.\nMatt Mulhern highlighted the book's focus on the pivotal role of Soviet bureaucrats known as \"mezhdunarodniki\" in implementing Soviet policy towards Africa during the Cold War. Telepneva's extensive research sheds light on Soviet assistance to African liberation movements, particularly in Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique, challenging previous narratives that downplayed Soviet involvement after Khrushchev's ouster. The review underscored Telepneva's meticulous examination of Soviet-African relations, emphasizing the overlooked agency of African leaders and the intricate dynamics of superpower competition in sub-Saharan Africa during this period.\n\n\n=== H-Net roundtable reviews ===\nFrank Gerits from the H-Net forums commissioned a roundtable discussion and review of the book. The published piece included an introduction by Lorenz Lüthi (from McGill University), five reviews (Elizabeth Banks, Alessandro Iandolo, Austin Jersild, Artemy M. Kalynovsky, and R. Joseph Parrott respectively), and a response to the reviewers by the author.\nLüthi thought the book is a \"fast-paced and well-researched monograph\". Banks highlighted the book's focus on the shift in Soviet priorities towards military and security support for national liberation movements in Lusophone Africa, challenging previous interpretations of Soviet foreign policy during the Cold War.\nIandolo praised Telepneva's expertise in presenting a thorough examination of Soviet actions in Africa, commending her extensive use of diverse source materials and her ability to construct compelling arguments supported by meticulous detail.\nJersild commended Telepneva's adeptness in weaving together disparate global threads of the Cold War era, showcasing how decolonization and ideological struggles intertwined across diverse regions. However, the reviewer noted a perceived gap in Telepneva's argument, questioning the alignment of mid-level officials' actions with socialist ideology and revolutionary fervor, suggesting a nuanced reassessment may be needed.\nKalinovsky lauded Telepneva's monograph for its comprehensive exploration of Soviet involvement in sub-Saharan Africa, and highlighted her detailed research that went back to the period up to Angola's independence and the collapse of the Portuguese empire.\nParrott noted that the book's focus on Soviet viewpoints may sometimes overshadow the portrayal of African actors and their perspectives.\nTelepneva responded to the reviewers' feedback. She addressed criticisms regarding the attention given to African actors and emphasized limitations in source material but asserting the book's focus on African-Soviet relations. Telepneva also discussed Soviet perceptions of African clients, highlighting the complexities of ideology and agency. She agreed with suggestions for further exploration but defended her book's focus and its contribution to understanding ideology versus strategy in socialist foreign policy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNatalia Telepneva's Profile on The University of Strathclyde Glasgow",

The tournament will take place at the Ostermann-Arena, Leverkusen, Germany from 21 to 23 June 2024. It will feature a field of 48 players and £175,000 in prize money, with £30,000 going to the winner.\nGerwyn Price is the defending champion after defeating Dirk van Duijvenbode 8–7 in the 2023 final.\n\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe prize fund remained at £175,000, with £30,000 to the winner:\n\nPre-qualified players from the Orders of Merit who lose in their first match of the event shall not be credited with prize money on any Order of Merit. A player who qualifies as a qualifier, but later becomes a seed due to the withdrawal of one or more other players shall be credited with their prize money on all Orders of Merit regardless of how far they progress in the event.\n\n\n== Qualification and format ==\nA massive overhaul in the qualification for the 2024 European Tour events was announced on 7 January.\nFor the first time, both the PDC Order of Merit and the PDC ProTour Order of Merit rankings were used to determine 32 of the 48 entrants for the event.\nThe top 16 on the PDC Order of Merit qualified, along with the highest 16 ranked players on the PDC ProTour Order of Merit (after the PDC Order of Merit players were removed). From those 32 players, the 16 highest ranked players on the PDC ProTour Order of Merit were seeded for the event.\nThe seedings were confirmed on 1 May.\nThe remaining 16 places went to players from four qualifying events – 10 from the Tour Card Holder Qualifier (to be held on 8 May), four from the Host Nation Qualifier (held on 19 May), one from the Nordic & Baltic Associate Nation Qualifier (to be held on TBC) and one from the East European Associate Member Qualifier (held on the 7 April).\nThe following players will take part in the tournament:\n\n\n== Draw ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

It is the second tier inter-county Gaelic football competition for male players between the ages of 17 and 20 in Ireland.\nTeams that are eliminated from the early provincial stages of the GAA Football All-Ireland Under-20 Championship qualify for this championship. Four teams currently participate.\nThe final serves as the culmination of a series of games played during the spring months, and the results determine which team receives the cup. The All-Ireland Championship is played on a straight knockout basis whereby once a team loses they are eliminated from the championship. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe All-Ireland Under-20 Football Championship was created in 1964 in response to a Congress motion put forward by the Kerry County Board. Various formats were used in the provincial competitions, however, the All-Ireland series was confined to the four provincial champions. A restructuring of the various provincial championships in 2024 resulted in the creation of Tier 2 competitions for teams who failed to make the latter stages of their provincial series. The four respective provincial Tier 2 champions qualify for the Tier 2 All-Ireland series of games.\n\n\n== Format ==\n\n\n=== Qualification ===\n\n\n=== Championship ===\nThere are four teams in the All-Ireland Championship. During the course of a championship season three games are played comprising two semi-finals and a final. The championship is played as a single-elimination tournament. Each game is played as a single leg.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External link ==\nOfficial GAA website",

        "content": "Filmlovers! (French: Spectateurs !) is an upcoming 2024 docufiction drama film written and directed by Arnaud Desplechin. It stars Milo Machado-Graner, Mathieu Amalric and Françoise Lebrun. It features the character of Paul Dédalus, who appeared in Desplechin's earlier films My Sex Life... or How I Got into an Argument (1996) and My Golden Days (2015). Acoording to Desplechin the film is meant to \"celebrate movie theaters and their manifold magic\".\nIt will have its world premiere in the Special Screenings section at the 77th Cannes Film Festival on 22 May 2024, where it will compete for the L'Œil d'or.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA film lover celebrates the magic of cinema. Memories, fiction and discoveries intertwine in a rapid flow of cinematic images.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nFilmlovers! is Arnaud Desplechin's fifteenth feature film and is an essay film in homage to cinema. It features the character of Paul Dédalus, who is considered Desplechin's alter-ego and who first appeared in his film My Sex Life... or How I Got into an Argument (1996) and its prequel My Golden Days (2015). In Filmlovers!, he returns to the character's childhood, and tells the story of how he got introduced to cinema: first as a spectator, then as a cinephile, and finally a filmmaker. The film is a hybrid of documentary and fiction that incorporates archival footage of film clips and stills as well as interviews with those who accompanied Desplechin in his experiences as a spectator. Ranging from Hollywood blockbusters to Italian neorealism, from the silent era to the cutting edge of contemporary cinema, the film is a journey through the images that shaped the filmmaking eye of Arnaud Desplechin. Desplechin wrote the film's screenplay, in collaboration with Fanny Burdino. The film was produced by Charles Gillibert at CG Cinéma. It is co-produced by Arte France Cinéma, in collaboration with Scala Films, in association with the French fashion house Chanel.\nPrincipal photography began on 17 July 2023 in Avion, Pas-de-Calais, where shooting took place for two days at the cinema Le Familia, which was transformed to resemble the 1960s and 1970s. Filming continued that same week in Roubaix and Tourcoing. Desplechin planned to shoot sequences in his former high school, in which a multimedia room bears his name. Filming then moved to Paris.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was selected to be screened in the Special Screenings section at the 77th Cannes Film Festival, where it will have its world premiere on 22 May 2024.\nInternational sales are handled by Les Films du losange, who will also distribute the film in France.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFilmlovers! at IMDb",

        "content": "Monyak (Bulgarian: Моняк) is a 12th-century medieval fortress in the Rhodope Mountains of southern Bulgaria, mentioned in the chronicles of the Fourth Crusade as Chastel de Moniac in Old French. It had a strategic role protecting the Zhelezna Vrata Pass.\n\n\n== Location and description ==\n\nMonyak is identified with the fortress ruins on a 587 m height rising on the left bank of the river Arda over the modern Studen Kladenets Reservoir. It lies in Kardzhali Province some 4 km south of the village of Shiroko pole and 12 km east from the town of Kardzhali. From Monyak there is an excellent visibility towards the Vishegrad Fortress (306 m) on the right bank of the Arda some 4.5 km to the west, as well as to the fortress of the medieval Monastery of John the Precursor 7.5 km to the west. Monyak and Vishegrad were likely constructed to the protect the region around the mouth of the river Varbitsa and the roads along its course.\nMonyak consisted of a citadel in the eastern highest section and an outer ring. It is difficult to access due to the steep escarpments of the hill. Its remains include parts of the defensive walls, an octagonal tower and water reservoirs dated from the 12th century, probably during and/or before the Third Crusade, built on the foundations of a significantly older Roman castrum. The preserved part of the outer fortress wall along the northern side of the hill is more than 270 m long, and its height in places reaches 7–8 m. It is built of stones welded with lime and sand. The remains of the tower is reach about 3–4 m in height. The entrance is from the west and was protected by two towers. The total area of the fortification is 18,000 m2, including the citadel that encompassed around 600 m2.\nDuring the construction of the fortress, serious attention was paid to the reservoirs. There are two above-ground water tanks. All this is evident of its function as protected habitation for a large number of people and the possibility to shelter an army.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe fortress was mentioned in the chronicles of the Third and Fourth Crusades of the late 12th and early 13th century as Manicaua or Moniac. The eyewitness account on the Forth Crusade On the Conquest of Constantinople by Geoffrey of Villehardouin mentioned the fortress on two occasions in the context of the 1206 campaigns of the Bulgarian–Latin wars between the Bulgarian emperor Kaloyan and the Latin Empire:\n\"Then did Henry, the Regent of the empire, take council with the barons that were with him; and they decided to ride forward. So they rode forward for two days, and encamped in a very fair valley, near a castle called Moniac. The castle yielded itself to them, and they remained there five days; and then said they would go and relieve Renier of Trit, who was besieged in Stanimac, and had been shut up therein for thirteen months. So Henry the Regent of the empire, remained in the camp, with a great part of the host, and the remainder went forward to relieve Renier of Trit at Stanimac.\"\nIt was at Monyak that Henry of Flanders was informed in late July 1206 of the death of the Latin emperor Baldwin I in Bulgarian captivity, who had been captured in the battle of Adrianople in the previous year, and headed to Constantinople for his own coronation:\n\"Then said the barons that they had often heard tell that the Emperor Baldwin had died in Johannizza's [Kaloyan's] prison, but that they did not believe it. Renier of Trit, however, told them of a truth that the emperor was dead, and then they believed it. Greatly did many then grieve; alas if only their grief had not been beyond remedy. So they lay that night in the city; and on the morrow they departed, and abandoned Stanimac. They rode for two days, and on the third they came to the camp, below the castle of Moniac, that lies on the river Arta, where Henry, the Emperor's brother, was waiting for them. Greatly did those of the host rejoice over Renier of Trit, who had thus been rescued from durance, and great was the credit given to those who had brought him back, for they had gone for him in great peril. The barons now resolved that they would go to Constantinople, and crown Henry, the brother of the Emperor Baldwin as emperor...\"\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nБалкански (Balkanski), Иван (Ivan) (1978).

        "content": "SS Nyassa was a steam ocean liner that was launched in Germany in 1906 as Bülow for Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL). In 1916 Portugal seized her, renamed her Trás-os-Montes, and placed her under the management of Transportes Marítimos do Estado (TME). In 1924 Companhia Nacional de Navegação (CNN) bought her and renamed her Nyassa. After a long career with CNN she was scrapped in England in 1951.\nAs Bülow, the ship sailed mostly between Bremen and the Far East. However, she spent 1907 making three return voyages between Bremen and Sydney, and in 1908 she made at least three return voyages between Bremen and New York.\nAs Nyassa, her scheduled route was between Lisbon and Moçambique via Cape Town. In 1941 she rescued survivors from a British merchant ship that had been sunk by a U-boat. From 1940 to 1944 she made numerous voyages taking refugees from Portugal, Spain, and Morocco to the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Palestine.\n\n\n== \"General\"-class liners ==\nBetween 1903 and 1908 NDL took delivery of a class of 11 twin-screw passenger liners, of intermediate size and speed, from four different German shipbuilders. All were named after Prussian field marshals and generals of the 18th and early 19th century, so they were called the Feldherren-Klasse, or in English the \"General\" class. Schichau-Werke in Danzig (now Gdańsk in Poland) built five of the class, including the lead ship, Zieten, which was launched in 1902 and completed in 1903. Joh. C. Tecklenborg in Bremerhaven built three: Roon in 1903, Scharnhorst in 1904, and Bülow in 1906. AG Weser in Bremen built two, and AG Vulcan in Stettin (now Szczecin in Poland) built one.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\nTecklenborg built the ship as yard number 209. She was launched on 21 April 1906 as Bülow, after Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow (1755–1816), a Prussian Army general who served in the Napoleonic Wars. She was completed and made her sea trials on 22 September.\nHer registered length was 462.4 ft (140.9 m), her beam was 57.6 ft (17.6 m), and her depth was 36.0 ft (11.0 m). Her hull had a double bottom and nine watertight bulkheads. The watertight doors in the bulkheads could be closed hydraulically by remote control from her bridge, and she was designed to remain afloat with any two of her compartments flooded.\nShe had berths for 2,044 passengers: 108 in first class; 106 in second class; and 1,830 in steerage. Her amenities included a passenger gymnasium with electric exercise machines. Some of her cargo holds were refrigerated. Her tonnages were 8,965 GRT and 5,034 NRT.\nEach of her screws was driven by a quadruple-expansion engine. The combined power of her twin engines was rated at 760 NHP or 6,500 ihp. On her sea trials she averaged 5,980 ihp, and maintained 16 knots (30 km/h). Her normal cruising speed in service was 15 knots (28 km/h).\n\n\n== Bülow ==\n\nNDL registered Bülow in Bremen. Her code letters were QJFB. On 26 September 1906 she left Bremen on her maiden voyage, which was on NDL's route to the Far East via the Suez Canal.\nAfter her maiden voyage, Bülow made three trips to Australia. On the first she left Bremen on 23 January 1907, carrying passengers including a German grand opera company recruited by the theatre producer George Musgrove. She called at Antwerp, Southampton, Genoa, Naples, and Port Said; passed through the Suez Canal; and called at Aden and Colombo. On 4–5 March she called at Fremantle; on 9 March she arrived off Adelaide; and on 12–13 March she called at Melbourne. On 16 March she reached NDL's wharf at West Circular Quay in Sydney. With Bülow and other ships of similar speed, NDL planned to reduce the journey time between Bremen and Sydney by five days. On her return voyage, Bülow left Sydney on 23 March, called at Melbourne on 25 March, Adelaide on 28 March, and Fremantle on 2 April, and reached Bremen on 8 May.\nOn her next voyage to Australia, Bülow reached Sydney on 3 July with passengers including 112 agricultural labourers for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, who were to change ships in Sydney and continue to Queensland. 104 of them were from Catalonia in Spain. The other eight were from Lincolnshire in England, where they had been earning nine shillings a week. Their contract with the sugar company increased their wage to 22 shillings and sixpence.\nOn her final voyage to Australia, Bülow reached Sydney on 23 October. Her passengers included four German scientists on their way to research in New Guinea. At Circular Quay they transferred to the NDL ship Prinz Sigismund to complete their journey. For her return voyage, Bülow loaded 6,900 bales of wool. She left Sydney on 2 November.\nIn 1908 NDL Bülow made at least three round trips on NDL's main North Atlantic route. She left Bremen on 11 January, on 23 January she arrived off New York, and on 28 January she left New York to return to Bremen. She made another transatlantic crossing that summer. She left Bremen on 25 July, was due in New York on 5 August, and left New York on 13 August to return to Bremen. She left Bremen again on 12 September with 503 passengers, arrived off New York on 23 September, and on 1 October left New York to return to Bremen.\nBy 1911 Bülow was equipped with submarine signalling and wireless telegraphy. By 1913 her wireless call sign was DBW.\nIn 1914 Bülow was on NDL's route between Bremen and Yokohama. Her ports of call were Rotterdam, Antwerp, Southampton, Gibraltar, Algiers, Genoa, Naples, Port Said, Suez, Aden, Colombo, Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tsingtau (now Qingdao), and Kobe. On return voyages she called at Nagasaki instead of Tsingtau.\nOn 2 May Bülow left Yokohama on a return voyage to Bremen via Suez. On 18 June she ran aground in fog on the west side of the Isle of Portland in the English Channel. Tugs rescued her 300 passengers and their baggage, and landed them at Weymouth. Bülow was only slightly damaged, and was the next day she was refloated and anchored in Portland Harbour to re-embark her passengers.\n\nIn July 1914 Bülow left Bremen on her next voyage. When the First World War began on 3 August, she took refuge in Lisbon. On 23 February 1916, the commander of the Portuguese Navy division in Lisbon seized 36 German and Austro-Hungarian ships in the port, including Bülow. On each ship a Portuguese crew was put aboard, the flag of the German Empire was lowered, and the flag of Portugal was raised. An explosive device was discovered in Bülow's boiler room, which was designed to detonate if the ship were moved. The Portuguese prevented it from being detonated, but her machinery was damaged.\n\n\n== Trás-os-Montes ==\n\nThe Portuguese Government assumed ownership of all the German and Austro-Hungarian ships, and founded a state-owned enterprise, Transportes Marítimos do Estado (TME), to manage them. Bülow was renamed Trás-os-Montes, after the region of the same name in northeastern Portugal. She was registered in Lisbon. Her code letters were HTOM.\nAfter the First World War, TME tried to start several scheduled liner routes. Trás-os-Montes was one of the ship that it put on a route between Lisbon and Rio de Janeiro via Funchal, Recife, and Salvador (see advertisement). However, TME ceased trading, and from 1922 Trás-os-Montes was laid up in Lisbon.\n\n\n== Nyassa ==\nIn 1924 Companhia Nacional de Navegação (CNN) bought Trás-os-Montes and renamed her Nyassa, after Niassa Province in northern Moçambique. CNN put her on its route between Lisbon and Moçambique, serving various Portuguese islands and African territories of the Portuguese Empire en route. By January 1938 her ports of call were Funchal, São Tomé, Pointe-Noire, Luanda, Porto Amboim, Lobito, Moçâmedes, Cape Town, Lourenço Marques (now Maputo), Beira, and the Island of Mozambique.\nBy 1932 the combined power of her twin engines had been reassessed as 1,170 NHP. By 1934 the refrigerated capacity in her holds was 13,014 cu ft (369 m3). Also by 1934, her wireless call sign was CSBJ, and this had superseded her code letters. By June 1938 she was equipped with an echo sounding device.\n\n\n=== 1940 refugee voyage ===\n\nPortugal remained neutral in the Second World War, and at first Nyassa remained on her scheduled route. However, in November 1940 she was diverted to take refugees from Europe to the United States. She left Lisbon on 23 November carrying 458 passengers, many of them refugees from German-occupied Europe, and some of whom had been held in insanitary internment camps in France. They included the electrical engineer and inventor Georges Lakhovsky, composer Oscar Straus, the son-in-law and daughter of the former President of Lithuania Antanas Smetona, and 27 Thais on a long and indirect journey home to Thailand. On 2 December her steering gear from her bridge froze in sub-zero temperatures. From then on she was steered from the emergency steering wheel on her poop, guided by telephone from her bridge. On 4 December she reached the quarantine station at Hoffman Island, New York, flying the signal flags for \"I am out of control\".\n\n\n=== Andalusian rescue ===\nOn the evening of 17 March 1941, U-106 made a torpedo attack on Convoy SL 68 off the coast of French West Africa, sinking two cargo ships. They included Ellerman & Papayanni Lines' Andalusian, which sank at position 15°50′N 20°42′W. There were no fatalities, and the 42 crew abandoned ship in two lifeboats. Her Master commanded the starboard lifeboat, carrying 23 men; while her Chief Officer commanded her port lifeboat, carrying 18 men. Overnight the two lifeboats became separated. The Chief Officer's boat headed for Cape Verde, and landed on Boa Vista on 20 March.\n\nThe Master's boat set sail for Bathurst (now Banjul) in Gambia. On 20 March Nyassa sighted the boat and rescued its occupants. Nyassa was en route to Lisbon via Funchal and Casablanca, where she was to disembark 400 Frenchmen who had refused to serve with the Free French forces. Andalusian's survivors feared being captured in Vichy-ruled Morocco, so they disambarked in Funchal. A few days later they continued their voyage aboard Lima, which reached Lisbon on 29 March.\n\n\n=== 1941 refugee voyages ===\nTwo dormitories were created in Nyassa's cargo holds, one forward and the other aft, to carry an additional 400 steerage passengers. On 16 April she left Lisbon carrying 816 passengers. Fares ranged from $160 for a berth in one of the dormitories, to $480 for a berth in a first class cabin. Passengers included the historian Julius Brutzkus, art dealer Herman Rothschild, and the 83-year-old father of shipping entrepreneur Arnold Bernstein. Passengers in the dormitories complained of a lack of light, ventilation, and space. One passenger said conditions were \"abominable\", and led to \"several clashes between the passengers\". Nyassa reached New York on 25 April.\nNyassa next left Lisbon carrying refugees on 25 May, and reached New York before 16 June.\nIn July 1941 Nyassa left Lisbon carrying passengers including 400 refugees. She called at Casablanca, where the passengers she embarked included another 200 refugees. She arrived in New York on 9 August carrying a total of 690 passengers. Among them was Hedwig Ehrlich, who was the widow of scientist Paul Ehrlich and sister of industrialist Max Pinkus. As Nyassa steamed up the East River to her pier, the New York pilot in charge of her miscalculated the state of the tide. The top 10 feet (3 m) of her foremast hit the Brooklyn Bridge, and was bent over at 90 degrees.\nOn 9 September 1941 Nyassa left Lisbon carrying 540 refugees. On 22 September she called at Havana, Cuba, where 318 of them disembarked. The remainder continued to New York.\n\nOn 12 November 1941 Nyassa left Lisbon carrying more than 600 refugees, most of whom were elderly. She disembarked 400 of them in Brazil, and then took more than 200 to Buenos Aires, where she arrived on 7 or 8 December. Argentinian immigration officers let 185 of them disembark on arrival, but 31 were at first denied permission to disembark. Most were in transit to either Colombia or Paraguay, and were allowed to disembark by 16 December. Three were detained in the Hotel de Inmigrantes, and one married couple was sent back to Europe because the wife was suffering from trachoma.\n\n\n=== 1942 refugee voyages ===\nNyassa left Lisbon in January 1942, and sailed via Casablanca to North America. On 3 March she reached Veracruz in Mexico, where disembarked 48 Spanish Republican refugees and a number of Jewish refugees. She also disembarked Jewish refugees at Newport News, Virginia on 17 March, and at Ciudad Trujillo (now Santo Domingo) in the Dominican Republic on 20 March. Her passengers on this voyage also included Jewish refugees destined for Cuba.\nOn 3 June 1942 Nyassa reached New York with 64 passengers after another voyage from Lisbon via Casablanca and Veracruz. At Veracruz she disembarked 865 Spanish Republicans. In New York she embarked 180 or 200 German nationals for repatriation to Europe, and left on 13 June.\nOn 10 July 1942 Nyassa left Lisbon, and a few days later she called at Casablanca to embark refugees who had arrived there from Marseille. On 21 July she arrived in Bermuda, where the United Kingdom authorities held her for five days. On 30 July she arrived in Baltimore carrying nearly 800 refugees, of whom 350 were Jewish and 198 were children. On arrival, two sick passengers were removed from the ship on stretchers. One, Bertha Klein, was taken by ambulance to the Marine Hospital in Baltimore, where she was declared dead on arrival. US authorities held the remainder aboard the ship, while US Navy intelligence, US Army intelligence, the FBI, and Baltimore Police Department checked each passenger. By the next day, nearly 200 passengers had been detained at Fort Howard.\nThe United States Customs Service seized jewellery from one refugee aboard Nyassa who had failed to declare them. At first it was reported that he had concealed diamonds, emeralds, rings and brooches worth a total of $50,000. On 11 September 1942 he pleaded guilty to smuggling uncut diamonds worth $9,000. US District Court judge William Calvin Chesnut fined him $1,000 and sentenced him to 30 days' imprisonment, after which both the defendant and his wife were to be deported from the US.\n\n\n=== 1943 refugee voyages ===\nNyassa left Lisbon in April 1943. By 7 May she had arrived in the US, carrying refugees including Oliver Freud, one of the sons of psychologist Sigmund Freud. On 24 June she left Lisbon with another party of refugees travelling to the US.\n\n\n=== 1944 refugee voyages ===\n\nNyassa left Lisbon on 25 January 1944 carrying 172 Jewish refugees, some of whom had been in Portugal since 1933. She then called at Cádiz, where she embarked another 570 refugees. On 1 February she reached Haifa in Palestine, where she disembarked 754 refugees. She was then to continue through the Suez Canal to Portuguese India and return via Moçambique to Portugal, repatriating civil servants who were long overdue home leave because of the war. The voyage made Nyassa the first merchant ship to make a commercial voyage through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal since Italy joined the Second World War in June 1940.\nIn June 1944 Nyassa left Lisbon carrying 75 refugees and 25 US citizens. On 8 July she reached Philadelphia after a 17-day crossing. On 18 September she left Lisbon with 118 passengers, including 95 refugees. On 1 October she reached Philadelphia. 13 of her refugees were to join relatives already living in the US. The remainder were to travel onward to Canada.\n\n\n=== Final years ===\nAfter the Second World War, Nyassa returned to her scheduled route between Lisbon and Moçambique. More than four decades after she was built, her machinery was still capable of 14 knots (26 km/h). From January 1950 she was laid up in Lisbon. In 1951 she was scrapped in Blyth, England.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSS Lourenço Marques\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHughes, David; Humphries, Peter (1977).

        "content": "The Jewish Baseball Museum is a virtual museum which is dedicated to the preservation of Jewish history in the sport of baseball. It was founded in 2016 by Chicago-based real estate developer and baseball fan Jeff Aeder who was an enthusiastic collector of Jewish baseball memorabilia.\nThe museum showcases the importance of baseball in the Jewish American community and history and has a vast collection of artifacts that provide a direct connection to the history of the game, including those related to Sandy Koufax and Hank Greenberg, the only two Jewish players in the Baseball Hall of Fame. It also lists every Jewish player who played in Major League Baseball and their biographies, as well as other notable figures in the sport, such as executives and umpires.\nThe museum is sponsored by both donations from fans and by Milt's Barbecue, a kosher barbecue restaurant in Lake View, Chicago, which was also founded by Aeder. In 2017, a year after the online museum was lauched, Aeder founded Milt's Extra Innings, a baseball-themed kosher deli situated next to the restaurant. The deli held a baseball exhibition in which the Museum's collections were on display until it closed 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Jewish Major League Baseball players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nJewish Baseball News, the Museum's Official Newsletter",

        "content": "The São Brás Market (Portuguese: Mercado de São Brás) is a historic building located in the Brazilian city of Belém, in the state of Pará. It was built during the Amazon rubber cycle. Construction began on May 1, 1910, and was completed on May 21, 1911.\nThe market was built to accommodate the large amount of trade generated by the Belém-Bragança Railway, whose last stop was in the São Brás neighborhood. It was also designed to expand the city's supply, which until then had been concentrated in the Ver-o-Peso Market. The structure is made from iron and mixes art nouveau and neoclassical elements, with sculptural details also in iron and decorative tiles.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Antônio Lemos, the mayor of Belém, granted the land to build the market. Materials and workers were imported from Italy, and the work was executed by the Italian engineer Filinto Santoro, who was also responsible for the Augusto Montenegro Palace and the Gentil Bittencourt School.\nIn 1988, during the administration of Mayor Fernando Coutinho Jorge, the market underwent a major renovation with significant changes to spatial aspects and use. After the intervention, the current building included spaces for theater, marketing and municipal administration workshops. Due to the acoustics and the amount of traffic, the theater was shut down and the market temporarily closed. The fish market, flanked by kiosks of the same style, form the cultural complex of the São Brás Market.\nThe second renovation took place between 1998 and 1999 under Mayor Edmilson Rodrigues and included the restoration of the roof, waterproofing and painting. At the time, due to the increase in informal work in the area, street vendors were relocated to the market.\n\n\n== Preservation ==\nThe São Brás Market is managed by Belém City Hall through the Municipal Secretariat for the Economy (Secon). The São Brás Market Architectural and Landscape Complex was listed as a historical heritage site by the Pará State Heritage Department on July 2, 1982. The building is currently suffering from poor maintenance by the public authorities. There are evident signs of deterioration in the space, with problems such as leaks in the walls and an accumulation of garbage. Despite the intense flow of people, the area around the building lacks security, which has led to frequent assaults and thefts in Floriano Peixoto Square, located near the market. The poor state of repair of the square also directly affects the market, as it is used as a shelter by homeless people.\n\n\n=== Structure and services ===\nToday, the São Brás Complex is composed of areas including a market, a fish and meat market, handicrafts, a grocery store and a food court. The structure comprises three pavilions with vaulted brick roofs and white marble decoration. It is located close to Almirante Barroso, José Bonifácio and Magalhães Barata avenues.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Belém\nCulture and tourism in Belém\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eitan Okun (born in 1978) is an Israeli neuroimmunologist, a professor at Bar-Ilan University.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nEitan Okon received his bachelor's degree in biology in 2003, his Master's in Immunology in 2004, and his Doctorate in Immunology in 2007, all from Bar-Ilan University. From 2007 to 2011, he was a post-doctoral fellow in neuroimmunology at the National Institutes of Health in Baltimore, Maryland.\nIn August 2011, he was appointed as a senior lecturer in the Faculty of Life Sciences at Bar-Ilan University. In February 2017, he was promoted to associate professor. His research, at the Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, focuses on Alzheimer's disease and investigates how immune system cells communicate with the brain during aging, in people with Alzheimer's disease, and individuals with Down syndrome. Another research focus is the connection between pregnancy with a Down syndrome fetus and the increased risk of cognitive decline in the mother.\nIn December 2022, he was appointed as co-editor-in-chief of the journal Neuromolecular Medicine.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nEitan Okon is married to Sarit, and they have four daughters and a son. They live in Kibbutz Alumim near the Gaza Strip, where Sarit's parents are founders.\nOn October 7, 2023, with the start of the Hamas-led attack on Israel at 6:30 AM, Sarit and the children took shelter in their home's safe room, while Eitan, as part of the kibbutz's emergency response team, went out to combat the dozens of militant who had infiltrated the area of the kibbutz and its surroundings. Only after five hours of fighting did a reinforcement team from the Masada unit arrive, followed by forces from Yahalom and the Paratroopers Brigade. Okon's combat in the battle of Alumim ended at 10:30 PM.\n\n\n== References ==",

In preparation for resale to retail, they \"broke\" the meat down from quarters to subprimal cuts and boned them prior to shipping. Retailers used these meat jobbers since they offered flexibility in cuts, and independent packers used them since they had to do minimal processing, requiring minimal capital investment.\n\n\n== References ==",

It fruits in April and May, producing yellow-orange drupes. Common names for this plant include yellow root (East Kalimantan), akar palo (Aceh), and akar kuning (Central Kalimantan). \n\n\n== Research ==\nThe plant is used in Indonesian traditional medicine, primarily because it contains berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid under preliminary research to identify its possible properties. \nDuring a field observation, a male Sumatran orangutan, known to researchers as Rakus, chewed vine leaves and applied the masticated plant material to an open wound on his face. According to primatologists who had been observing Rakus at a nature preserve, \"Five days later the facial wound was closed, while within a few weeks it had healed, leaving only a small scar\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Fibraurea tinctoria at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Genevoise sauce or Geneva sauce is a type of French brown sauce made from fish fumet, mirepoix, red wine, and butter usually accompanied with fatty fishes such as trout and salmon. Some versions use white wine instead of red wine. \nThe sauce was originally made from the braising liquid from dishes prepared \"à la genevoise\" popular during Marie-Antoine Carême's time. One of the first recipes for the sauce was given by the eighteenth-century French chef and writer Louis Eustache Ude who used white wine instead of red wine. \nThis sauce was later further popularized by the French chef and writer Auguste Escoffier in his book Le guide culinaire.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nFish bones (ideally salmon heads) and mirepoix are first sautéed in butter. The pot is then deglazed with red wine and reduced by half. Fish fumet is then added and simmered for about 40 minutes. The sauce is then finished with cold knobs of butter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFrench cuisine\nSauce Espagnol\nFrench mother sauces\nVelouté sauce\nSauce Bercy\nFish fumet\nBrown stock\nDemi-glace\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Edwin Sydney Jackson (17 May 1922 – 10 April 2016) was a Canadian actuary who served as president and chairman of Manulife. Jackson joined the Manufacturers' Life Insurance Company in 1948 in Toronto, and during the 1950s and 1960s rose through the company's ranks. In 1970 he was elected a director, and in 1972 was appointed president. After the death of Manulife's chairman in 1978, he became acting chairman of the board. In 1985, Jackson stepped down from the presidency and was elected chairman. He served in that role until 1990, through he stayed on as a director. After the abrupt resignation of chairman Thomas di Giacomo in August 1993, Jackson served as the interim chairman until March 1994. That year, aged 72, Jackson retired from Manulife.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nEdwin Sydney Jackson was born on 17 May 1922 in Regina to Edwin Jackson (1882–19??) and Dorothy Hazel Bell (1892–1974). In 1940 he graduated from Regina Central Collegiate. From 1943 to 1945, Jackson served as an officer in the Canadian Army.\nAfter the war, Jackson enrolled at the University of Manitoba, and in 1947 graduated Bachelor of Commerce. Following graduation, he taught actuarial studies for a year. In 1948, he moved to Toronto where he joined the actuarial department of the Manufacturers' Life Insurance Company. In 1952 he became an assistant actuary, in 1956 an actuary, and in 1964 an actuarial vice-president. In 1969 he was appointed a senior vice-president, and in 1970 became an executive vice-president and was elected to the board of directors. For the 1966–67 year, he served as president of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries.\nOn 1 January 1972, Jackson succeeded Alfred Thomas Seedhouse as president of the company. At this time, Seedhouse was elected chairman of the board. When Seedhouse died on 12 February 1978, Jackson became the acting chairman.\nIn August 1985, Jackson stepped down from the presidency and was elected chairman of the board and chief executive officer. The presidency was assumed by Thomas Anthony di Giacomo, who gained the chief operating officer title also. In January 1987, Jackson ceded the chief executive role to Giacomo. Effective 1 May 1990, Jackson stepped down from the chair, and Giacomo was elected chairman in addition to president and chief executive. On 19 August 1993, Giacomo resigned from the company, leaving the offices of president, chairman, and chief executive vacant. Giacomo's resignation came after a falling out with the board that had begun in November 1991. Upon Giacomo's departure, William R. C. Blundell was appointed interim president, while Jackson became interim chairman. In early 1994, Manulife recruited Dominic D'Alessandro, then president of the Laurentian Bank of Canada, as its next president, while Blundell was elected chairman of the board. After Blundell's election, Jackson announced his retirement from the company.\nOn 19 May 1948, Jackson married Nancy Joyce Stovel (1927–1998) of Winnipeg. The Jacksons had three daughters: Patricia, Barbara, and Catherine. Sydney Jackson was a member of the Granite Club, Toronto Club, and United Church of Canada. He died at his home in Toronto on 10 April 2016, a month short of his 94th birthday.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jonas Žilinskas (1888–1956) was a military officer and the first head of the interwar Lithuanian intelligence service, the Unit of Intelligence (Žvalgybos skyrius).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJonas Žilinskas was born in 1888 in the village of Smalininkai in Congress Poland. Žilinskas was a law student in the Saint Petersburg State University and an officer in the Russian Imperial Army. He became famous for organizing a small Lithuanian volunteer force around the area of Kalvarija. In 1918, then-Colonel Jurgis Kubilius received notice about Žilinskas. Žilinskas was called to Vilnius and ordered to \"be a permanent, now paid official of the Supreme Military Council\". The assignment date of Žilinskas, 27 October 1918, is considered the start of Lithuanian military intelligence activities. On 1 December 1918 Žilinskas officially joined the Lithuanian army. According to Žilinskas's memoirs, Liudas Gira, a local of Vilnius, advised Žilinskas on what individuals to trust in the new endeavor. Žilinskas and his team would send information to Prime Minister Augustinas Voldemaras. To cover the true nature of his work, Žilinskas was officially named a \"special affairs officer\". On 6 January 1919, the News unit (Žinių dalis) was established in Kaunas, which would later divulge into an organized intelligence agency. In the beginning, a total of four agents worked in the agency. On 12 May 1919, the News unit was re-established as the Unit of Intelligence. However, Žilinskas at that time was ill, and so had to be often substituted by Mikalojus Lipčius, who would become Žilinskas's official successor on 12 July 1919. After his service in military intelligence, Žilinskas was made the chief censor. He also served in the 7th Infantry Regiment. After being demobilized in 1922, Žilinskas worked at the Bank of Lithuania. After the 1926 Lithuanian coup d'état, Žilinskas was made chief of the railway police. From 17 October 1929 he worked in Kaunas as a notary.\n\nIn 1944 Žilinskas moved to Germany, and later to the United States. Žilinskas died in 1956.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Konstal 114Na (after modernization 114Na – MF 12) is an articulated low-floor tram, manufactured in 1997 by Konstal works in Chorzów, in a quantity of 2 units for the Gdańsk Municipal Transport Company. It is the second low-floor tram type produced in Poland after the 112N. A significant part of the solutions was taken from the previously produced single unit of the 112N type.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nIn the late 1960s, the production of the first Polish modern trams, Konstal 13N, was completed, and work was underway on further tram models. Among many projects, only Konstal 102N and its modified version, Konstal 102Na, were successfully implemented. However, the production of these trams did not meet the current needs, so in 1973, the prototype of the Konstal 105N tram was developed. The model was put into production in 1974 and was well received by transportation authorities due to its modern design. Despite this, significant changes were introduced to the design after just 5 years, resulting in the most popular model in the Konstal 105Na family. Vehicles of this generation were still being produced in the 1990s, although they were considered outdated and underwent various modernizations.\nIn September 1992, a GT6N tram from Bremen was tested in Warsaw; however, the city authorities did not purchase any new low-floor trams. In 1995, Konstal produced its first tram with a low-floor section, the two-section model 112N, which was sold to Warsaw.\nDuring this time, trams in Gdańsk were in poor condition, both in terms of rolling stock and infrastructure. The Gdańsk authorities began to modernize their public transportation fleet. The new tram utilized many elements from its predecessor, including the entire front section and the end section of the rear part, effectively being a three-section version of the 112N.\n\n\n=== Production ===\nIn 1997, two trams of a new type were produced, which were structurally developed from the 112N tram. The 114Na tram is distinguished primarily from its predecessor by the additional middle section, which houses a low floor. The prototype entered the tracks in Gdańsk on 20 March 1997, while the second one on 18 April 1997. Thanks to this design, Gdańsk became the second city in Poland to have a partially low-floor tram and the first to have more than one such type.\nProduction ceased after the introduction of the low-floor trams Konstal 116N and Konstal NGd99 into the market.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe 114Na is a three-section, unidirectional, single-sided tram with 13% low floor accessibility. Compared to its predecessor, an additional section was added, and the low-floor section was placed in the middle compartment. This allows wheelchair users (with the assistance of another person) and strollers to enter. Despite similarities, the body structure was made using a different technology than the Konstal 105Na model. The body is made of closed profiles and represents a structural development of the Konstal 112N tram. The connection between the sections is made using double articulation, previously unused in Poland, allowing for quick uncoupling and coupling of the mechanical and electrical parts.\nThe floor is made of plywood-rubber panels and covered with anti-slip flooring. The flooring is smooth and folded onto the walls to facilitate interior cleaning. The tram is equipped with five doors, each 1,300 mm wide, folding outwards, secured with a triple system to prevent passengers from being caught (sensitive edges, phototube, overload switch). The doors can be opened centrally by the driver and by passengers using buttons.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe tram features exclusively single seats, mostly facing forward. The seats were specially designed for this vehicle and were among the most modern seats used worldwide at the time of production. They are vandal-resistant yet covered with elegant fabric. One of the tram's advantages is its large capacity, able to accommodate a total of 285 passengers. This is more than two times the capacity of the 105Na and slightly less than three times the capacity of the 105Na.\nThe tram is equipped with forced air heating. There are no ventilation or air conditioning devices inside the carriage; only natural ventilation is possible through tilting windows and roof hatches.\nThe 114Na is equipped with fluorescent lights illuminating the interior of the body as well as additional lights illuminating the doors.\n\n\n=== Propulsion system ===\nA thyristor-based traction control system is employed, capable of energy recuperation during braking. The entire system is mounted on four traction bogies.\nThe tram is equipped with a control panel allowing for maneuvering at a speed of 10 km/h.\n\n\n== Exploitation ==\n\n21/22 March 1997 marked the delivery of the first tram to Gdańsk, followed by the second in April. They were assigned serial numbers 1501 and 1502, respectively, and were directed to the Wrzeszcz depot to serve on line no. 12. Initially, due to numerous breakdowns, the trams spent more time in the depot than on the tracks. Thanks to the arrival of these vehicles, plans to build the line to Chełm were resumed. However, an expert analysis conducted at the Gdańsk University of Technology revealed that the 114Na trams, like all others in service at the time, were not suitable for operating on such a line profile. In 1999, Gdańsk purchased additional trams tailored to the needs of disabled people – the Konstal NGd99, which could safely operate on this line.\nDuring the initial period of operation, these trams were characterized by a high incidence of electrical system failures, which prompted a modernization by the Municipal Transport Company in Łódź in 2000. It was decided to replace the IGBT transistors with GTO thyristors, which had proven successful in the 105N2k and 116N models. In the following years, the incidence of failures decreased, although it was not eliminated. During this overhaul, the trams were repainted in colors different from the standard Gdańsk livery.\nOn 10 January 2002, tram no. 1501 was involved in a minor collision. The tram stopped at Błędnik Street, then rolled into an NGd99 tram. As a result of the collision, the bumper of the 114Na was slightly damaged.\nIn 2008, tram no. 1502 was taken out of service for repairs. The downtime lasted 4 years and was accompanied by a minor modernization. Seats were replaced, and the livery was changed to something more akin to the colors used on Gdańsk buses. A similar scope of repairs was carried out on the second tram at the Wrzeszcz depot.\nDue to an extensive overhaul at their own facilities, tram 1501 was sent for major repairs to Modertrans in February 2012. During this repair, the tram received front panels similar to those used in the Moderus Beta MF 01, sandboxes were built, seats were replaced, and LED displays were installed. Despite these upgrades, the vehicle cannot operate on the Chełm line due to insufficient power. After the modernization, the tram was designated as 114Na – MF 12. In March 2016, Gdańsk Public Transport Authority announced a tender for the modernization of the second tram, similar in scope to the one carried out in 2012 by Modertrans. In early July, Modertrans won the tender as the sole bidder. The refurbished tram returned to Gdańsk in late July and early August. During the overhaul, the focus was on the interior and electronics, aiming to preserve as much of the original appearance as possible, as the carrier plans for the tram to become a historic vehicle in the future.\nIn December 2015, tram no. 1501 was named after the Polish writer Stanisława Przybyszewska.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hauxley Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located at the village of Low Hauxley in the county of Northumberland. A lifeboat was first stationed here in 1852.\nHauxley lifeboat station was closed, when a motor-powered lifeboat was placed at Amble in 1939.\n\n\n== History ==\nA lifeboat was placed at Hauxley in 1852, managed by the Newcastle Shipwreck Association (NSA), initially to co-exist with the existing NSA station at Amble, only a couple of miles further north. But there was some belief that Hauxley was better suited as a location for a lifeboat, and this was borne out, with Amble being closed in 1856.\nA site at Hauxley was provided by Capt. S. F. Widdrington, RN. A boathouse was constructed, and a 34-foot self-righting lifeboat, costing £200, was commissioned with Teasdel of Great Yarmouth, all funded by local dignitary, Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland. The boat arrived at Hauxley on the 8 September 1852, and was named Warkworth. In 1853, the station became part of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS), which would become the RNLI in 1854.\nWarkworth would serve for three years at Hauxley, launching on service only 4 times, but saving 20 lives. Remarkably, all 4 launches were within a 5-day period. In a storm of 6 January 1854, Warkworth was launched to the aid of the Monarch of Guernsey, rescuing all 10 crew. Later the same day, a second launch saved 6 from the Earl of Newburgh, of South Shields.The storm raged on, and on 9 January, the lifeboat saved the crew of 4 from the Heroine of Burnham. Sadly, the lifeboat launched on its fourth service on the 10 January 1854 to the Catherine Maria of Odense in Denmark, but the ship broke up, and all lives were lost.Awards were made, see Station honours.\nHauxley would receive a replacement lifeboat in 1855, a 30-foot unnamed Peake-class lifeboat, built by Forrestt of Limehouse and costing £155, once again funded by the Duke of Northumberland. She was transported from London on the steam ship Pioneer to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, from where she was towed north, arriving in Hauxley on 7 August 1855. On 4 January 1857, she would be launched twice, firstly being taken 3 miles down the coast, and launched to the aid of the Sophie of Oporto, rescuing the crew of 11. The lifeboat would then go the aid of the Georgina of Inverness, rescuing a further 5 men. For these services, Capt. Hipplewhite received the RNLI Silver Medal\nIn 1865, Hauxley would receive their third lifeboat. A 34-foot Self-righting (P&S)  boat constructed by Forrestt at a cost of £295, she arrived in Hauxley in 1866 after being conveyed by the Great Northern and North Eastern Railway companies free of charge. Modification were carried out to the boathouse, and a new carriage was required, costing £163 in total. The recently deceased Duke of Northumberland had been president of both the RNIPLS and the RNLI, and all costs were met by his wife, Eleanor Percy, Duchess of Northumberland, in memory of her late husband, the boat being named Algernon and Eleanor.\nA further two lifeboat would be supplied to Hauxley. In 1887, a 37-foot 12-oar  Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, costing built by D & W Henderson of Partick, Glasgow, and again named Algernon and Eleanor (ON 195). Then in 1902, a 34-foot 10-oar Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat, constructed by Thames Ironworks at £598. Provided by a legacy from Miss M Andrew, of Hale, Cheshire, the boat was named Mary Andrew (ON 483). Two coxswains would be awarded the RNLI Silver Medal for their long service, James Armstrong in 1885, and later Andrew Oliver in 1899.\nThe Hauxley lifeboats were launched a total of 81 times, and save 246 lives. It was only when the RNLI decided to reopen the station at Amble with a motor powered 45ft Watson-class lifeboat, the Frederick and Emma (ON 659), that Mary Andrew was withdrawn from service, and the Hauxley station was closed in 1939. The lifeboat house still exists, and today is a private residence.\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Hauxley\n\nRNLI Silver Medal\nMiddleton Henry Dand, Land Owner - 1849\nMiddleton Henry Dand, Land Owner - 1854 (Second-Service Clasp)\nCapt.

        "content": "Jean Barbara Wainwright  (born in June 1954) is a British professor and curator in London. As an art historian and critic she has specialized and exhibited her expertise regarding Andy Warhol's life and work. Her method  features interviews with artists, photographers, filmmakers and curators known internationally. Wainwright ’s archives contain over 1,000 interviews of which many have been published in numerous catalogues and books. She had contributed such work to the Tate Gallery's archives with over 170 interviews also available on the Internet. With special interest in art-world connectivity, her many interviews done for Audio Arts have created a twenty-year profile of art at large. Knowledge of the art world has expanded considerably, academically, through her archive beginning in the 1960s, since then developing into her roles in teaching, supervision and as a consultant.\nWainwright has published considerably and contributed to many catalogues and books.  She also regularly appears on television and radio, most notably on Channel 4, the BBC, Open University, Resonance FM and BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The lists of her artist interviews and titles are extensive.\nWainwright's doctorate was on Warhol's audio tapes. She has become a senior lecturer at UCA Rochester and as an art critic often works with Art Newspaper TV. While she did exhibitions with Tracey Emin, the frequency  of Warhol mentions awakened Wainwright's interest in Warhol's films, looking at their relationship to young British artists. In New York and Pittsburgh she got involved with the family and a grant came through for her for work on a PhD involving sound, so she zeroed in on Warrhol's tapes. Her job is to lead a department of cultural studies and clear the way for students to contextualise their work in photography. She is very fond of teaching and speaking and closeness to creative processes.\nJean Wainwright is Director of the Fine Art and the Photography Research Centre at UCA. She has focused on photography and the emergence of new themes and processes, including contemporary and political work by Dagmar van Weeghel, Bettina von Zwehl, Emily Allchurch, Julia Fullerton-Batten and contrasting Karine Laval as well as Michele Cirillo.\nWainwright's Audio Arts Archive begun in 1996 continues to grow and she went online at the Tate in 2014.  Her international exhibitions include My Search for Andy Warhol’s Voice 2011–2012, Ship to Shore: Art and the Lure of the Sea 2014, Gestures of Resistance 2017, Powerful Tides, 400 Years of Chatham and the Sea 2018, Another Spring 2018 and Documents from the Edges of Conflict 2021–2022. She covers major art fairs and events interviewing artists. Her contributions have included corporate projects such as  Crossrail, The Eden Project, Heathrow Terminal 2 (Slipstream), Ebbsfleet Valley and BT Connected World for FutureCity and FuturePace. Events she has covered include Frieze (London), Art Basel in Miami and Basel, the Venice Biennale and The Armory (New York).\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a black mountain between Al-Arj and Al-Ruwaitha, to the right of who ascend from Medina to Mecca, it's water streams to Rathm.\"\nAram ibn al-Asbag mentioned in the names of the mountains of Tihamah: The first mountain he meets on his left is Wareqan, which is a large black mountain, which starts from its stream to Al-Mu'tashi which also called Al-gyi, between Al-Arj and Al-Ruwaitha. I has all kinds of fruitful trees including qarad, sumac, pomegranate, and khazm. It has also sweet water springs.\nKhazam is s a tree whose leaves resemble papyrus, and has a stem like the stem of a palm tree.

It contains sumac, and qard, It also has water springs. The inhabitants of Wareqan are the Banu Aws bin Mazinah, the people of Amud. Asadi said: It is to the left of the road when you come out of Sayyala, and it's connects to Mecca. Araam mentioned that it is the mountain that is next to Al-gyi Al-Qudsan and is separated from it by Okbat-rukuba. Mentioned also in Al-Tabarani's hadith that Wareqan is one of the mountains of paradise according to him. And in the hadith of Muhammad when he said that \"The best mountains are Uhud, Al-Ash'ar, and Wareqan\" and that it is one of the mountains that fell in Medina as one of the mountains to which Allah manifested himself to him according to Muhammad. In tradition, it is one of the mountains from which the Kaaba was built. Also in the Islamic narrative in the hadith of Muhammad he said: \"Do you know what the name of this mountain?\" meaning Wareqan \"This is Hamat, a mountain from paradise, may Allah bless it and bless its people\". Then he said, \"This is Sajasaj al-Ruha'a, this is a valley of paradise.\"\n\n\n=== Al-Baladi Al-Harbi ===\nAl-Baladi Al-Harbi said: \"It is a grizzled mountain, not a black one, as reported in the books of the ancients.

The people sing of its difficult and impenetrable terrain. It is today for Awaf from a Harb tribe. It's waters divided between Ghor and Jalas al-ghor in Al-Safra valley and Al-Jalas in Al-Furaish valley, then Malal and Idam.

        "content": "Friedrich Wilhelm Meves (April 14, 1814 – April 9, 1891) was a German naturalist, ornithologist and entomologist. He worked as a curator of birds at the Swedish Museum of Natural History. He experimentally demonstrated cosmetic colouration in lammergeiers and mechanical sound production involved in the drumming displays of snipes.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nMeves was born in Delligsen, in the duchy of Braunschweig to pastor Ludvig Christian Friedrich and Augusta Wilhelmine née Lüders. Even as a child he took an interest in insects while his mother harvested potatoes. His father died in 1827 and Meves was taken care of by his maternal grandfather pastor Lüders in Braunschweig. At fifteen he went to study pharmacy at Elbengerode am Harz and graduated after a five-year apprenticeship. He continued to study and also observe birds in the field. He went to the University of Kiel in 1840 where he was employed as an amanuens by Friedrich Boie. He then left his pharmacy studies and improved his skills in the preparation of skins and in taxidermic mounts. When Carl Jacob Sundevall visited Kiel in 1841 he offered Meves a position at the Riksmuseum in Stockholm. Meves moved to Sweden in 1842 and worked there until his retirement in 1877. As part of the museum work, he collected extensively across Europe and Russia and published extensively on his findings. He took a special interest in the immature stages of birds and their plumages. He was a founding member of the Stockholm Entomological Society in 1879. Among his major works was a manual of taxidermy that he published in 1882. The African starling Lamprotornis mevesii was named in his honour.\nMeves was able to demonstrate using chemical analysis that the reddish coloration of adult lammergeiers and of their outside of the eggs was caused by iron oxide. Meves was also the first to identify the source of the drumming sounds of snipe as the tail feathers. He had observed it first in the field in 1856 but he attached the outer tail feather with a fine thread to a steel wire and attached it to a stick and was able to move it rapidly through the air to recreate the bleating sound.\nMeves married Ida Lappe, daughter of Karl Lappe, in 1844 and became a Swedish citizen in 1865. Ida was an active translator of poetry. She died a year before him. He bequeathed his personal collections of birds eggs and butterflies to the Swedish museum. He had no children of his own but adopted a nephew Julius Seelhorst-Meves (1844–1926) who became an entomologist.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKurzer Leitfaden zum Präpariren von Vogelbälgen und zum Conserviren und Ausstopfen der Vögel (1882)",

Based on the game show with the same name, the game released on November 16, 2012, worldwide, for the Nintendo 3DS, the PlayStation 3, and Wii. The game also released on the Nintendo Switch on December 2, 2022.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn The Cube, players navigate through a series of puzzles and obstacles within a cube-like structure. The objective is to escape by progressing through chambers and levels. The gameplay involves solving puzzles, overcoming obstacles, and manipulating the environment to unlock pathways forward. Puzzles vary in type, including logic challenges, spatial problems, and platforming sequences.\nPlayers have to navigate three-dimensional environments and adjust the cube's layout to reveal hidden pathways. Players must also engage in platforming and exploration, avoiding hazards while searching for hidden secrets and collectibles. Difficulty increases gradually as players progress, with puzzles becoming more complex over time. The game features a total of 33 challenges. If the Cube is beaten, Extreme Mode is unlocked, featuring more extreme versions of five games: Revolution, Pathfinder, Perimeter, Rebound, and Momentum.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe 3DS version of The Cube received \"generally unfavorable\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.\nDaan Koopman for Nintendo World Report rated the game 5/10, stating that \"Considering the only person to win The Cube was a double Olympic gold medalist, I'm not surprised the game would be hard.\"\nPeter Willington for Pocket Gamer rated the game 1 and a half out of 5 stars, stating that \"Extremely short if you can get the hang of the infuriating mini-games, The Cube is a cynically produced tie-in of a ropey-looking British TV show.\"\nAdam Riley for Cubed3 rated the game 6 out of 10 stars, stating that \"Only some poor touch screen implementation and a lack of motivation for constantly coming back to replay to better scores mar what is otherwise a faithful accompaniment to The Cube on TV.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Cube at MobyGames",

        "content": "Hareket (Turkish: Action) was a monthly conservative political magazine which was published between 1939 and 1982 in Turkey with some interruptions. The magazine is known for its support of the Anadoluculuk (Turkish: Anatolianism) approach.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nHareket was established by Nurettin Topçu, a conservative intellectual, in Izmir in 1939. The first issue of the magazine appeared in February 1939. Its title was a reference to the action theory of Maurice Blondel who was the teacher of Topçu. The magazine was edited by Nurettin Topçu. From the sixth issue the headquarters of the magazine moved to Istanbul.\nHareket temporarily ceased publication in May 1943 and was restarted in March 1947. Its publication again ended in June 1949. The magazine was revived in December 1952, but ended publication June 1953. The magazine was restarted in January 1966 and continued its publication until March 1977. The magazine was again restarted in March 1979 and permanently folded in March 1982 after producing a total of 187 issues.\nBoth the title and subtitle of the magazine were changed during its run. It was Hareket: Fikir-Sanat (Turkish: Action: Idea-Art) between February 1939 and May 1943. Its subtitle was Fikir-Ahlak-Sanat (Turkish: Idea-Ethics-Art) from March 1947 to June 1949 and Aylık Siyasi Mecmua (Turkish: Monthly Political Journal) from December 1952 to January 1953. Then it was redesigned as Aylık Fikir Mecmuası (Turkish: Monthly Journal of Ideas) in February 1953 and was used until June 1953. The magazine was renamed as Fikir ve Sanatta Hareket (Turkish: Action in Art and Idea) in January 1966, and that title was employed until its closure in March 1982.\n\n\n== Contributors ==\nTopçu published many articles in Hareket and discussed metaphysical and practical issues about the state and social structure that the Turkish nation should have. Major contributors of Hareket included Mehmet Kaplan, Hilmi Ziya Ülken, Ahmet Kabaklı, Ali Fuat Başgil, İsmail Kara, Beşir Ayvazoğlu, Mükrimin Halil Yınanç, Süleyman Uludağ, Ayhan Songar, Halit Refiğ, Yaşar Nuri Öztürk, Orhan Okay, Mustafa Kara, Cemil Meriç, Emin Işık, Hüseyin Hatemi, Hüsrev Hatemi, Ziyaeddin Fahri Fındıkoğlu, Ali Bulaç, Hüseyin Batuhan and Remzi Oğuz Arık.\n\n\n== Content and views ==\nHareket featured articles by Turkish writers and thinkers. In addition, it published interviews and translations of the work by Western and Eastern writers, including Stefan Zweig, Oscar Wilde, Paul Valéry, René Wellek, Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore, Jacques Prévert, Edgar Allan Poe, Blaise Pascal, Charles Péguy, Frederick Mayer, André Maurois, Irving Kristol, Karl Jaspers, Immanuel Kant, Victor Hugo, Charles Baudelaire, Raymond Aron, Julien Benda, Anton Chekhov, Miguel de Unamuno, Will Durant, Mahatma Gandhi and André Gide.\nSince its early issues, Hareket attached new meanings to the concepts of religion, nationalism, social order and revolution which differed from the official views. It promoted an understanding of nationalism which was different from Ziya Gökalp's nationalism. For Hareket a national history existed within the borders of Anatolia, and this approach is called Anadoluculuk (Turkish: Anatolianism). In this approach Turkishness develops within Islam.\nAlthough Hareket was a political publication, it did not support any political party.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Earfood is a jazz album by the Roy Hargrove Quintet, issued by the EmArcy record label in 2008. The album was a return to Hargrove's enduring interest in hard bop, following several albums in which he explored jazz within a hip-hop and R&B context.\nEarfood is notable for the inclusion of the composition, Strasbourg / St. Denis, which has since emerged as a modern-day jazz standard.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCritical perspectives of Earfood were largely positive upon its release. Writing for The New York Times, jazz critic Nate Chinen selected Earfood as his critics' choice. Chinen declared the album to \"attest to a classic jazz ideal\" while \"rarely sound[ing] as if [Hargrove] stepped out of a time machine\". Chinen attributed this to Hargrove's successful merging of his \"hard-bop and groove-orientated sides\". Hargrove's success at melding hard-bop with modern jazz was also observed in a positive AllAboutJazz review, which noted Hargrove's success was \"redefining the hard bop of the 1950s and 1960s through the post bop lense of the 1980s and 1990s\".\nSome jazz critics, though enthused by Hargrove's approach to Earfood, were less so by its execution, with John Fordham from The Guardian describing the exceptional musicianship as creating an \"atmosphere of infallibility\" and giving the session an \"unjazzy character\". This criticism was noted elsewhere, with others assessing the overall feel of the album to be \"too sterile\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll compositions by Roy Hargrove except as indicated.\n\n\"I'm Not So Sure\" (Cedar Walton)– 5:46\n\"Brown\" – 4:30\n\"Strasbourg / St. Denis\" – 4:38\n\"Starmaker\" (Lou Marini) - 7:54\n\"Joy Is Sorrow Unmasked\" – 4:46\n\"The Stinger\" - 4:57\n\"Rouge\" - 2:46\n\"Mr. Clean\" (Weldon Irvine Jr.)- 5:51\n\"Style\" - 6:35\n\"Divine\" – 5:10\n\"To Wisdom The Prize\" (Larry Willis) - 5:43\n\"Speak Low\" (Kurt Weill, Ogden Nash) – 5:16\n\"Bring It On Home To Me (Sam Cooke) – 3:00\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nMusicians\n\nRoy Hargrove  – trumpet, flugelhorn\nJustin Robinson  – alto saxophone, flute\nGerald Clayton  – piano\nDanton Boller  – bass\nMontez Coleman  – drums\nProduction\n\nLarry Clothier – producer\nRoy Hargrove - producer\nJacques Muyal - executive producer\nAl Schmitt - recorded & mixed\nSteve Genewick - engineer\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Remember My Song is the fifth studio album by British musician Labi Siffre. Released in 1975, it was the first of Siffre's two albums released that year, the other being Happy.\nDespite having some notable backing musicians such as Big Jim Sullivan co-producing, Brian Bennett of the Shadows on drums, and Chas & Dave who would become well known in their own right, the album did not chart.\nThe album garnered a resurgence of interest in 1999, when its opening track \"I Got The...\" was sampled by American rapper Eminem on his first hit \"My Name Is\", eventually leading to the whole album being reissued in 2006.\n\n\n== Composition and recording ==\nIt was co-produced by session guitarist Big Jim Sullivan and record producer Derek Lawrence. Siffre wrote or co-wrote all tracks on the album with the exception of \"Old Time Song\", which was written by studio musicians Chas Hodges and  Dave Peacock, who later became known as the duo Chas & Dave.\nLike all of Siffre's albums from before, Remember My Song was released on the Pye International record label.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe album lingered in obscurity for many years until 1999 when the beginning song \"I Got The...\" was sampled by the American rappers Eminem and Dr. Dre for Eminem's first hit single \"My Name Is\". The hook played by Hodges and Peacock featured prominently and was heavily repeated throughout the single in a replayed sample.\n\nThis newfound interest in Siffre's work led to \"I Got The...\" being released as a single in 2003 on the Stateside record label, with a larger collection of Siffre tracks being reissued in 2006.\n\"I Got The...\" was also sampled a few years earlier by another rapper Jay-Z on the track \"Streets Is Watching,\" from his 1997 album In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, although he used a different part of the song than Eminem.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlbum of the Year\nDiscogs",

        "content": "Tanshihuai (136–181) was a Xianbei chieftain who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty period of China. It was under Tanshihuai when the Xianbei became a unified polity and posed a constant threat to the Han dynasty's northern borders for many years. After his death, however, his state quickly fell apart as his grandsons failed to maintain the support of the tribes.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early life and rise ===\nTanshihuai's mother was the wife of a man named Touluhou (投鹿侯). While Touluhou was serving in the Xiongnu army for three years, his wife gave birth to him at home. When he returned, Touluhou believed Tanshihuai to be the product of an affair and wanted to kill him before his wife intervened. She claimed that while she was out in the day, she had heard the sound of a thunderstorm. When she looked up, a piece of hail fell into her mouth, and she became pregnant with Tanshihuai after she swallowed it. Although Touluhou did not believe her, he decided not to kill him, only forcing her to send him away. The wife secretly gave Tanshihuai to her parents for them to raise.\nAs Tanshihuai was growing up, he was described as brave, strong and resourceful. At the age of 14 or 15, a leader from a different tribe robbed his grandfather's cattles and horses. On horseback, Tanshihuai chased them down and recovered all the stolen animals, which made him renown among his people. As an adult, his laws and judgements were fair, and his followers did not object to them, so he was elected to be the main leader of his tribe. He moved his base to Mount Danhan (彈汗山; in present-day Shangdu County, Inner Mongolia), where he built a court on the banks of the Jieqiu River (歠仇水).\nTanshihuai's soldiers and horses were strong, and many of the tribes in the east and west submitted to him. He conducted raids on the Han dynasty's borders and blocked the Dingling's encroachment from the north. He also repelled Buyeo's attacks from the east and attacked the Wusun in the west. His territory was comparable to the former Xiongnu empire, covering more than 14,000 li from east to west and 7,000 li from north to south including mountains, rivers, swamps and salt lakes.\n\n\n=== War with the Han dynasty ===\nIn 156, Tanshihuai led around three to four thousand cavalry to invade the Han dynasty's Yunzhong County. He led more attacks on the Han's northern borders in 158, 159 and 163. In 166, the Xianbei allied with the Southern Xiongnu and Wuhuan to attack nine border commanderies, plundering them and killing many of the local officials and people. The Han sent the general, Zhang Huan, to attack them, and the Xianbei withdrew from the border fortresses. Fearing their inability to restrain him, the Han sent their envoys with official seals and ribbons to Tanshihuai, offering him the title of King in hopes of reaching a peace agreement. However, Tanshihuai rejected them and only intensified his intrusion.\nTanshihuai divided his domain into three sections; from Youbeiping to the east up to Liaodong, encompassing over twenty cities including the Buyeo and Yemaek tribes, formed the eastern part. From Youbeiping to the west up to Shanggu, including over ten cities, formed the central part. From Shanggu to the west up to Dunhuang and the Wusun, including over twenty cities, formed the western part. Each section was governed by a chieftain appointed by Tanshihuai, who swore fealty to him.\nDuring the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, the Xianbei attacked the border commanderies of You, Bing and Liang provinces, leaving countless dead and devastating the regions. In 177, the Han launched a counterattack on the Xianbei. They sent the generals Xia Yu, Tian Yan and Zang Min, along with the Southern Xiongnu chanyu, Tute Ruoshi Zhujiu to venture beyond the Great Wall. The Han army marched over 2,000 li before facing Tanshihuai in battle and were heavily defeated. Only one-tenth of the Han army returned safely, and later that winter, the Xianbei raided Liaoxi.\nIn 178, the Xianbei raided Jiuquan Commandery. At the time, the Xianbei population had grew to the point that farming, herding and hunting alone could not longer sustain them. Therefore, Tanshihuai went to the Wuhouqin River (烏侯秦水; modern-day Laoha River, Liaoning) to promote fishing, but initially had no success. Hearing that the Han people (汗人, not to be confused with 漢人 Han people) were excellent fishers, he led his cavalry to attack them in the east and captured thousands of them. He relocated them to live along the Wuhouqin River to fish for the Xianbei and alleviate their food shortage. While the earlier Records of the Three Kingdoms refer to these captured people as \"Han people\", the later Book of the Later Han refer to them as \"Wa people\" (倭人), with \"Wa\" being an old term for Japan. K. H. J. Gardiner and Rafe de Crespigny reason that it is feasible that \"Han people\" refers to the people of Panhan county (番汗縣) in Liaodong Commandery, which was well within Tanshihuai's area of influence, and the far-fetched suggestion that Tanshihuai invaded Japan by sea could hardly be considered when the Xianbei at the time could not effectively fish for themselves.\n\n\n=== Death and descendants ===\nTanshihuai died at the age of 45 in 181 and was succeeded by his son, Helian, signifying an attempt at shifting away from the elective-based system of succession to a hereditary system. However, in the coming decades, the vast state that Tanshihuai had built would quickly fall apart. After Helian was killed during a raid on Han, the chieftains acclaimed his nephew, Kuitou as his successor since his son, Qianman, was too young at the time. Once Qianman became of age, however, he challenged Kuitou's succession and caused many of the Xianbei chieftains to break away. Following Kuitou's death, his domain was divided between his brothers, Budugen and Fuluohan, but by 233, both were killed by a rival chieftain, Kebineng, who absorbed their remaining territory.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nChen, Shou (3rd century).

While Makin Island has a well deck, the earlier two Flight 0 America-class ships USS America and USS Tripoli were designed and built without a well deck to make space for aircraft and aviation fuel.\nShe will be the second Flight I America-class ship, and as such will include a well deck. The design of the Flight I America-class ships, including that of Helmand Province, adopts a compromise, incorporating a slightly smaller aircraft hangar as well as smaller medical and other spaces to fit a small well deck for surface connector operations. The island structure will also be modified to free up more room on the flight deck to accommodate maintenance of V-22s, compensating for some of the lost aircraft hangar space.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe then-LHA-10 was authorized by the United States Congress in 2023, providing $US 1.38 billion for her procurement.\nThe ship was named by Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro on 2 May 2024, intending to honor the US sailors and marines who fought in the strategic Helmand Province Campaign during the War in Afghanistan.\n\n\n== References ==",

Her first artistic appearance on television was in the movie “The Promised Night.” Zayed gained prominence for her roles in the series \"Tears in Shameless Eyes\" and \"Heat Wave,\" as well as her part in the theatrical production \"Extra Sugar.\" Her career in cinema commenced in 1987 with her debut film \"Life is Wasted, My Son.\" Notably, she rose to fame for her performances in \"The Egg and the Stone\" and \"Those Gentlemen,\" the latter being a groundbreaking Egyptian film that addressed the subject of gender-affirming surgery (female-to-male) in Arabic societies.\nShe died on November 10, 2014, following a long battle with the Lung cancer. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nZayed was born on November 5, 1953, on Champollion Street in central Cairo, into a family with a rich tradition in acting, writing scripts, and singing.

        "content": "Bajirao's Konkan campaign  usually referred as Janjira campaign  or Janjira War\nThe succession war after the death of Sidi Rasul Yakut in February 1733 ignited a complex and protracted conflict for control over Janjira, marked by intrigue, shifting alliances, and external interventions. Abdulla, the rightful heir, found himself challenged by his own kin, including his son Sidi Rahman, amidst the ambitions of rebellious governors like Shaikh Yakub Khan. The situation escalated with the involvement of the Marathas, led by Baji Rao and later joined by the Pratinidhi, in a campaign against the Sidis. Despite initial successes, including the conquest of key fortresses, the conflict endured due to the resilience of Janjira fortress and external support sought by the Sidis from European powers and regional rulers\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe death of Sidi Rasul Yakut in February 1733 triggered a civil war for succession in his kingdom. His son Abdulla, the rightful heir, faced challenges from his brothers and even his own son Sidi Rahman. The situation worsened with the rebellious governors, particularly Shaikh Yakub Khan, who was ambitious and had a Hindu convert background. Intrigues by Prabhu Sardar Yashwant Rao  further fueled the internal conflict, leading to Sidi Rahman and Shaikh Yakub Khan aligning with the Marathas. Baji Rao was tasked by Shahu to lead the expedition against the Sidis, with FattehSingh Bhosale joining later.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\n\nBaji Rao seized the fortresses of Tala and Ghosala in the Konkan, then clashed with Saikhoji Angre at Dandrajpuri. Siddi Abdulla was killed at Janjira, prompting a siege. Despite efforts by Baji Rao and Manaji Angre, the fortress held, with the Siddi seeking help from the Portuguese, English, Mughals, and Nizam. Marathas raided various places, but outside aid was limited. The Portuguese sent ships under the guise of mediation, the Mughals urged English assistance, but focused on trade. Ultimately, the siege ended without resolution\nThe Pratinidhi, led by Anand Rao Sarlaskar and Krishnaji Dabhade, joined Baji Rao's campaign on May 20. However, Baji Rao's enthusiasm waned upon their arrival. Despite this, the Pratinidhi's clever intrigues led to the conquest of Raigad on June 8, 1733. Bankaji Naik further strengthened the Maratha cause by capturing Bankot and Mandangad fortresses, then defeating the Sidi at Goalkot on July 8. Although the Sidi fled to the fortress, they did not surrender.\nBy July, most of the Sidi's dominions had fallen to the Marathas, alarming the English who had suffered from Angre's actions. They sent a battleship to aid the Sidi against Angre's siege on Underi island, but failed. In September, another squadron was dispatched, coinciding with Saikhoji Angre's death, leading to internal conflicts among the Marathas. Shahu refrained from appointing a single Commander-in-Chief, causing a loss of command at sea to the Sidi and the English, who formed an alliance. The Nizam supported the Sidi, prompting Chimnaji Appa to stay in Poona. Additionally, conflicts between Maratha factions and indifference from allies led to a decline in Maratha activities. Despite attempts to take Janjira, quarrels between the Angre brothers appeared to be failure of the Konkan campaign.\nIn December 1733, realizing the challenges including loss of sea control and lack of cooperation, BajiRao sought an honorable peace, recognizing Abdul Rahman as chief of Janjira. Despite this, tensions persisted, leading to ongoing conflict. Efforts to remove Sidi Sat from Anjanwel and Goalkot were hindered by quarrels and lack of siege equipment. In 1736, Shahu dispatched Chimnaji Appa to halt Sidi Sat's aggression. A decisive battle ensued on April 19, resulting in Sidi Sat's defeat and death, along with Sidi Yakub, the fort commandant.\n\n\n== Result ==\nIn 1736, the Marathas secured victory at a high cost, leading to the death of Siddi Sat and easing Brahmendra Swami and Shahu's concerns. Siddi Rahmakh of Janjira proposed peace terms, ending the war on the condition of friendship with the Peshwa. Despite retaining control of Anjanwel and Goalkot, the Siddi's power declined, confirming the Peshwa's supremacy in the Konkan. The Peshwa's dominance was further solidified due to internal conflicts within the Angre family, which weakened their position. Baji Rao seized the opportunity to intervene in the Angre quarrel, dividing authority and possessions between Sambhaji and Manaji Angre, ultimately diminishing the Angre's strength and resources.\n\n\n== Maratha Portuguese relations after and during the Campaign ==\n\n\n=== First Phase ===\nBy 1736, Baji Rao had significantly weakened the Sidi and Angre powers, leaving only the Portuguese as a concern. The Portuguese had intervened in domestic disputes among the Angre brothers, aggravating tensions with the Marathas. Their power, established in India since 1498, had declined by the late 17th century, coinciding with the Marathas' ascent. The Portuguese had alienated their Hindu subjects through forcible conversions, destruction of temples, and other oppressive measures. Seeking refuge in Maharashtra, some Hindus, like the Pathare Prabhus, aimed to overthrow Portuguese rule. Gangaji Naik sought support from Sambhaji, Kanhoji Angre, and Khanderao Dabhade without success. In 1720, Baji Rao's influence in Kalyan prompted efforts to engage the Portuguese. Antaji Raghunath and Ramchandra Raghunath of Malad urged Baji Rao for action. Baji Rao, recognizing his growing power, sent Pilaji Jadhav and reinforcements against the Portuguese in 1731, achieving significant victories.\n\n\n=== Second Phase ===\nThe passage describes the strategic movements and battles during the Maratha campaign against Portuguese strongholds in the Konkan region in 1737. Beginning with the gathering of Maratha forces under Baji Rao's command, it details their surprise attacks and captures of forts such as Thana, Salsette, Dharavi, and Arnala. Despite initial successes, delays due to the rainy season and Baji Rao's departure led to a temporary halt in the campaign. However, reconnaissance efforts continued, leading to eventual resumed attacks on Bassein in the following cold weather season.\n\n\n=== Fall of Vasai ===\nDuring the siege of Baçaim in May 1739, Maratha forces, led by Chimaji Appa, breached the walls near the towers of São Sebastião and Nossa Senhora dos Remedios. Despite fierce Portuguese opposition, the Marathas eventually succeeded, demolishing the tower of São Sebastião and compelling the surrender of the fort on May 16. The remaining garrison left with honors on May 23, with the saffron flag raised over Baçaim.\n\n\n== Maratha English Relations After Campaign ==\nIn May 1739, the English, alarmed by the Portuguese's downfall, dispatched two embassies: one to the Peshwa and the other to Shahu. Captain Inchbird's mission to the Peshwa failed, while Captain Gordon succeeded with Shahu, securing an alliance due to Nadir Shah's impending invasion of Maharashtra. Shahu, relieved by Nadir Shah's departure and the Portuguese's defeat, warmly welcomed the English envoy, prompting an alliance granting free trade throughout the Peshwa's domains. By June 1739, the Peshwa's authority extended over the North and the Konkan.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nDuring the fallout with the Sidi, Sambhaji aimed to weaken the Angres by fueling their conflicts. Exploiting their discord, he instigated a clash in 1734, attempting to seize Anjanwel from Sidi Sat. Manaji, eager for power, betrayed Sambhaji, aligning with the Portuguese against him. Sambhaji's subsequent retaliation was initially repelled, but when Manaji failed to honor his agreement with the Portuguese, they withdrew support, allowing Sambhaji to reclaim Kolaba. Manaji, realizing his mistake, sought aid from the Peshwa, offering territory in exchange. The Peshwa intervened, granting Kolaba to Manaji and Suvarnadurg to Sambhaji, seeking to balance power between them.\nSambhaji and his ally, the Pratinidhi, opposed the division of power and possessions of Anges, despite Shahu's approval. Baji Rao's actions in the Konkan in 1736 led to conflict with Sambhaji and sparked a war with the Portuguese. Even after the Portuguese defeat in 1739, internal strife persisted, ultimately leading to the downfall of the Angre family. This decline, starting in 1735, culminated in their complete destruction in 1755\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Henry Kassagi (born Abd El-maǧīd al-QaṣʿAǧī, 28 September 1932 – 23 June 1997), known as Kassagi, was a Franco-Tunisian magician, painter, actor, author and former pickpocket.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHenri Kassagi was born Abd El-maǧīd al-QaṣʿAǧī in Halfaouine, a district of Tunis. At the age of 12 he witnessed a magic trick and from that moment knew his vocation: he had already trained his hands in dexterity by pickpocketing in the streets of Tunis.\nAt the start of the 1950s, he left Tunisia for Paris, where he continued to earn his living as a pickpocket. There he met the film director Robert Bresson, who gave him the position of technical advisor to perfect the actions of the thieves in the film Pickpocket, as well as appearing as instructor and accomplice to the main character.\nAfter Pickpocket, Kassagi's face and techniques were too well known for him to continue with his old trade, and he changed career to become a stage magician. In the following years, he made a name for himself in the world of magic shows and conjuring in France and around the world. His speciality resembled the technique of pickpockets, described in the Grand Larousse encyclopédique.\nKassagi appeared in photo comics published in the magazine Télé Poche, and was invited to appear in television shows such as Télé Dimanche. He was successful and made several world tours.\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, he bought the house of the priest of Bonnefoi in Orne, which he restored.\nHis career declined at the end of the 1970s. In 1981 he decided to return to his native country, intending to build an entertainment centre including a casino, a restaurant, an exhibition hall, a nightclub and a theatre in Hammamet. This ambitious project did not come to fruition and he returned to France.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHis first wife was his French assistant Hélène Chauvel, the mother of their son Dominique (born 1956). After their divorce, Kassagi met a German woman, Marion König, in Berlin during an engagement In the city. She became his assistant on and behind the stage, and they married on 29 February 1980. In the same year their daughter Vanina was born. They separated in 1991 and the divorce was finalised later.\nKassagi died at the age of 64 in his apartment at 6, boulevard Jourdan in the 14th arrondissement of Paris and was found on 23 June 1997. The forensic pathologist attributed the death to cerebral infarction, which had occurred three or four weeks before the discovery of the body. A funeral at Père-Lachaise Cemetery was organised by his ex-wife Marion and his daughter; however, after the intervention of his Tunisian family and son and the Consulate General of Tunisia in Paris, his body was transferred to Tunisia. He is buried at the Djellaz cemetery in Tunis.\n\n\n== Fimography ==\nPickpocket (1959)\nNavarro (TV series), season 7, 1995: episode 2 – \"Coup bas\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\"Kassagi\".

        "content": "The Huni Kuin Artists Movement (MAHKU) is a group composed of Huni Kuin artists and researchers, an indigenous people living in the Brazilian Amazon, between the state of Acre and Peru. The group's origins are linked to Ibã Sales Huni Kuin's research on the Huni Meka, ayahuasca chants in the Hãtxa Kuin language. The artists seek to transform and create bridges with the non-indigenous through murals, drawings, and paintings, hence building alliances and strengthening their own strategies of autonomy. The group is constituted by founder Ibã Huni Kuin, Kássia Borges, Acelino Tuin, Cleiber Bane, Pedro Maná, Yaka Huni Kuin, Rita Huni Kuin, Cleudo Txana Tuin, and Isaka Huni Kuin, represented by the Carmo Johnson Projects gallery\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 2000s, leaders amongst the Huni Kuin people, especially Ibã, began conducting workshops to translate Huni Kuin chants, myths and practices into drawings, involving his son Bane, nephew Acelino and relative Maná. Many of MAHKU's works are visual translations and interpretations of Huni Meka chants, traditional knowledge accompanying Nixi Pae rituals utilizing ayahuasca, a tea composed of amazonian vegetation with hallucinogenic potential, used for centuries by varied South American tribes.\nIn Huni Kuin iconography, the area of uncertainty between dreams and myths is often depicted through geometric framing that is adapted according to the artwork's structure and imagery, guaranteeing free expression and autonomy within a non-linear story. Within the Miração(vision's) perimeter, there are no hierarchies between the represented beings, as the threshold between abstraction and figuration loses all meaning. What we find is the result of an image-process, stemming from dialogue and learning among those involved, whose ultimate goal is healing, both for the artist and the observer interpreting it, allowing a spiritual experience.\nThe group seeks to build bridges between indigenous and non-indigenous worlds, between the visible and the invisible. Through partaking in exhibitions, the group has found sustainable paths in extending traditional lifestyle, setting in motion alligators, snakes, and vine teas, therefore disseminating its myths, stories, and art.\nIn 2012, Ibã, along with anthropologist Amilton Pelegrino de Mattos, professor at the Federal University of Acre, decided that the group's work had the means to expand beyond Acre, creating a blog and sharing it with those who might be captivated by indigenous culture, not limited to other anthropologists. In the same year, the blog reached both curator and anthropologist Bruce Albert, and artistic director Hervé Chandès at Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain, inviting the founder to participate in Histoires de voir, Show and Tell.\nIn 2014, MAHKU's work was selected for the exhibition Made by... Made by Brazilians, curated by Marc Pottier, at the former Matarazzo Hospital in São Paulo. Ibã, Bane, and Isaka painted panels on the walls of three rooms and, at the end of the event, sold their first piece, a 5-meter canvas. The proceeds from this sale were invested in the purchase of the first 125 acres of land. Since then, they have sold about 15 works, but in smaller sizes and values, and more lands have been bought.\nIn 2017, the collective launched at the 35th Panorama of Brazilian Art, curated by Luiz Camillo Osorio, the Ibã Huni Kuin Wall Project(Isaías Sales), who is a txana, master of chants in the tradition of the Huni Kuin people. This led to the creation of The Spirit of the Forest Project, curated by Ibã and his son, exploring the Huni Kuin imaginary through unorthodox storytelling given western parameters.\nIn 2018, the exhibition Through the Poetics of MAHKU was held with artists Ibã Huni Kuin and Bane Huni Kuin. Curated by Roberta Paredes and Amilton Pelegrino, the works exhibited at the Arts Gallery of the Federal University of Amazonas were part of the Spirit of the Forest project collection.\nIn 2020, they launched the exhibition Vaivém at the Bank of Brazil's Cultural Center, in Belo Horizonte. Curated by Raphael Fonseca, the produced canvas was inspired by the concept the exhibition's central theme; that peoples emerge from intricate social webs, that cycles of life and death occur in such webs, and that their existence allow for the survival of traditions, as Amerindian culture is narrated through webs of storytelling, acting as a societal cornerstone.\nIn 2021, Carmo Johnson Projects Gallery began representing MAHKU, presenting work in the exhibition Everything is Dangerous, Divine, and Wonderful, curated by Daniel Dinato. The demonstration sought to engage in dialogue between the collective's representation of ancestral strength in myths and chants with Bruno Novelli's hybrid imaginary of beasts and tropical landscapes.\nIn 2022, they launched the exhibition Chants of Images, curated by Ibã Huni Kuin and Daniel Donato, being co-produced between Casa de Cultura do Parque and Carmo Johnson Projects. The paintings and installation were complemented by the experience of Huni Meka chants, demonstrated live during the event. Later that year, the group presented the exhibition MAKHU: Sells Paintings, Buys Land at the SBC Contemporary Art Gallery in Montreal. Curated by Ibã Huni Kuin and Daniel Dinato, the central theme relied on the use visual art as a weapon in the struggle for the political, ecological, and cultural autonomy of the Huni Kuin people.\nIn 2023, they launched the exhibition Mirações (Visions) at São Paulo Museum of Art, which brought together about 120 paintings and drawings on paper and canvas, three of them produced for the show, commissioned by the museum, as well as sculptures, audio recordings of chants, a documentary video, and a large-scale painting directly elaborated on the sides of the museum's red staircase. In the same year, the group presented Choreographies of Impossible at the 35th São Paulo Art Biennial. It consisted of a series of eighteen newly commissioned paintings, each 220 centimeters wide by 260 centimeters high, arranged side by side in a semicircular format that covered the closing of the purple floor's ramp in continuing format.\nIn 2024, the collective was invited to participate in the 60th International Art Exhibition of the Venice Biennale: Stranieri Ovunque - Foreigners Everywhere, by Brazilian curator Adriano Pedrosa. The group gained prominence by presenting a 750 square meter painting on the facade of the Biennale's central pavilion in the Giardini, titled Kapewë Pukeni (alligator-bridge), engulfing the viewer in the Huni Kuin's myth of origin. The myth tells the tale about the intercontinental separation between peoples and the consolidation of Huni Kuin identity. Kapewë Pukeni thus becomes a central image in reinforcing ties between foreigners worldwide and in the role of art as a means of resistance.\n\n\n== References ==",

He attempts to get back to Spain to reunite with his pregnant partner Mariama.

Distributed by Filmax, it was released theatrically in Spain on 12 April 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJavier Ocaña of Cinemanía rated the film 2½ out of 5 stars, writing that there were \"little cinema and a lot of good intentions\", while also assessing the film to be the worse picture so far of Zambrano's solid career.\nSalvador Llopart of La Vanguardia rated the film 2 out of 5 stars, lamenting that \"the protagonists turn out to be schematic ideas rather than real characters\".\nLaura Pérez of Fotogramas rated the film 3 out of 5 stars, assessing that it \"is overly explanatory\", but also writing that \"it takes flight in the sequence of the fence jumping\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Spanish films of 2024\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A biscuit warmer (also bun warmer) is a kitchen utensil, a container with a kid and an insert pan. Typically the pan is constructed of wire mesh, and the cover has openings for ventilation. The early warmers, also known as folding biscuit boxes, were placed by the fire in order to keep biscuits inside warm. The warmers were made from various materials such as ceramic, metal, or fabric, and come in different sizes and designs to suit preferences and decor of the user.\n\n\n== General use and functionality ==\nBiscuit warmers are commonly used during meal times, especially for breakfast or brunch, to ensure that biscuits remain warm and fresh until they are served. They are typically placed on the dining table or buffet to keep the biscuits easily accessible during meal times.\nThe primary function of a biscuit warmer is to keep biscuits warm and fresh until they are served, by insulating the biscuits and retaining the heat generated during baking. Some biscuit warmers may have lids to help trap heat and moisture, further preserving the biscuits' texture and flavor.\n\n\n== Design ==\nBiscuit warmers are of a variety of designs. They can range from being simple and functional to decorative and elaborate. Some biscuit warmers may also have handles or knobs for easy handling. Sizes range from small individual warmers designed to hold a few biscuits to larger ones suitable for serving a whole batch.\nDifferent materials, including ceramic, metal, fabric, or a combination of materials are used in making the biscuit warmer. Ceramic biscuit warmers are popular for their ability to retain heat well, while metal ones may offer durability and often have decorative designs. Fabric biscuit warmers typically have a cloth lining to help keep biscuit warm and refreshingly edible. \n\n\n== See also ==\nBread warmer\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 11th Federal Assembly of United Left was held in Madrid from 4 June to 5 June 2016, to renovate the governing bodies of United Left (IU) and establish the party's main lines of action and strategy for the next leadership term. A primary election to elect the new general coodinator of the party was held from 26 May to 29 May 2016. This was the first leadership election in IU's history in which all the party members were allowed to vote.\nThe congress was held just before the 2016 Spanish general election, which IU contested in a coalition with Podemos. This decision produced an internal rift, leaving the party divided into three factions. The first one was composed of incumbent General Coordinator Cayo Lara and members of the old guard who were radically against any alliance with Podemos. The second was led by IU's spokesman in the Congress of Deputies Alberto Garzón—who was contesting the general election for Unidos Podemos—and received the support of the majority sector of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and of most of the IU federations. The third sector was made up of members of Open Left (IzAb), the party led by former general coordinator Gaspar Llamazares, a longtime critic of Lara's leadership.\nThe leadership election saw a generational renovation with Garzón becoming the new general coordinator in a landslide as he received 74.7% of the members vote. Meanwhile, the candidacy of Paloma López Bermejo—supported by Lara and the old guard—received 20.8% of the vote and the candidate of IzAb, Tasio Oliver, finished last with just 4.6% of support.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\n\n\n== Endorsements ==\n\n\n=== Total ===\nCandidates seeking to run were required to collect the endorsements of at least 400 party members or 5% of the total Federal Political Council (CPF) members.\n\n\n=== Public endorsements ===\n\n\n==== Alberto Garzón ====\n\n\n==== Paloma López Bermejo ====\n\n\n==== Tasio Oliver ====\n\n\n==== Álvaro García Mancheño ====\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Peoria Blades were an American semi-professional ice hockey team located in Peoria, Illinois. The team played in the Continental Hockey League for 10 seasons and was the most successful franchise in the history of the league, winning 3 championships.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormer teammates with the Pekin Stars, Pete BardezBanian and Mark Olson formed the Blades in 1971 as an independent outfit at an outdoor rink. A little over a year later, the two were able to get agreements from several other local teams to form a new league called the Continental Hockey League. While still playing for the club, BardezBanian became the team's president while Olson worked as the head coach and general manager. Olson's three sons Joe, Mike and Ric, all played for the Blades and they quickly turned the team into a league powerhouse.\nThe Kenosha News reported Peoria as winning the league championship in 1974, though other contemporary accounts were contradictory. What is certain is that Peoria finished as runners-up in 1975 before winning three consecutive league championships. Before the title run, Ric Olson was on the United States national team during the run up to the 1976 Winter Olympics. He was the final defenseman cut from the team which would go on to finish 5th.\nAfter the club's fifth trip to the finals in 1981, ice hockey had become so popular in Peoria that the Blades became victims of their own success. A brand new arena, the Peoria Civic Center opened in 1982, and the International Hockey League took note. The IHL placed an expansion team in Peoria that fall and the Blades, unable to compete with the pro team, ceased operations. As a nod to the team that had made it all possible, Ric Olson was a member of the Peoria Prancers for its inaugural season and played in four games.\nFor their efforts with the team, both Mark Olson and Pete BardezBanian were later inducted into the Peoria Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Season-by-season record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHockey DB",

        "content": "\"The Mediterranean\" is a 1933 poem by the American writer Allen Tate.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\"The Mediterranean\" is written from the perspective of an American in correspondence with a classical heritage, especially Virgil's Aeneid. The protagonist visits a vaguely Aeneidean setting at the Mediterranean Sea and ponders about himself, the mythic dimension of classical culture, and the United States.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe poem has an epitaph which is a modified version of a line from book I of the Aeneid, where Venus pleads with Jupiter for her son Aeneas and his men. The original quotation is Quem das finem, rex magne, laborum?, meaning \"What end, great king, do you set to their ordeals?\" In Tate's version, laborum (labor) has been replaced by dolorum (pain). According to Lillian Feder, this change was a way for Tate to say that modern man cannot really justify labor because he lacks a \"heroic goal\", and is left only with pain.\nIn The Kenyon Review, Vivienne Koch described the poem as \"Coleridgean in form, and Arnoldian in symbolism\". Robert Dupree wrote in The Southern Review that \"The Mediterranean\" stands out, together with \"The Cross\" and \"The Last Days on Alice\", as a poem where Tate explores \"the difference between merely perceiving (erkennen) lifeless units and truly understanding (verstehen) vital forms\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFull poem - Poets.org",

        "content": "Elsa Alsen (7 April 1880 – 31 January 1975) was an American dramatic soprano and concert singer, born in Prussia, best known for her Wagnerian roles. \n\n\n== Early life ==\nAlsen was born in Obra, Prussia, the daughter of a French mother and Norwegian father.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAlsen made her operatic debut in 1902, in Heidelberg. She sang as a contralto early in her career, then as a dramatic soprano, often in Wagnerian roles, especially Brünnhilde and Isolde. She appeared with various German opera companies for twenty years before her American debut in 1923, while touring with the Wagnerian Opera Company. She sang with the Chicago Civic Opera Company from 1925 to 1928.\nAlsen gave a concert at New York's Aeolian Hall with Georg Liebling in 1925. She was \"acclaimed with deafening applause\" at a 1928 appearance in Detroit, sang with the Washington National Opera in February 1928, and sang arias at the Milwaukee Sängerfest later that year. In 1929 she sang at a large Memorial Day event in Los Angeles. She was a \"favorite\" at the Hollywood Bowl by 1930, and in the 1930s she sang at four concerts with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and was a concert soloist with Paul Althouse at several events, including a Sängerfest in St. Paul in 1932, and with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in 1934.\nAlsen made several recordings in the 1920s, all on the Columbia label. She appeared in an early sound-era film, The Rogue Song (1930). She was featured on radio programs in the 1930s. She was appointed director of the Cecilia Music School of the Madonna House Settlement in 1937. She taught voice students in New York City, into her eighties.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAlsen married Richard Henneberger in 1913. She became a naturalized United States citizen in the 1930s. She died in 1975, at the age of 94, at a nursing home in New York City.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nElsa Alsen at IMDb\n\"Caro mio ben\" and \"Lascia ch'io pianga\", 1926 recordings of Alsen singing, via Internet Archive\n\"Musicians at the Hollywood Bowl campaign committees breakfast, Los Angeles, 1930\", photo including Elsa Alsen, from the UCLA Library Special Collections",

        "content": "The Jason Hargrove Transit Center (JHTC) is a major public transit station in Detroit, Michigan, United States. It is the third iteration of the State Fair Transit Center, located at the old Michigan State Fairgrounds, near the intersection of 8 Mile Road and Woodward Avenue. It serves as the secondary hub for the Detroit Department of Transportation bus network, as well as a major transfer point for the suburban SMART network, served by 13 bus routes between the systems.\nThe JHTC repurposes the former Dairy Cattle Building, the last remaining structure from the Michigan State Fair at the site.\n\n\n== Services ==\nServices from the transit center include 13 bus routes, 10 of which terminate at the station. As of May 2024, the transit center is expected to serve 25,000 passengers per week.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Fairgrounds ===\nThe Michigan State Fairgrounds, an approximately 160-acre (65 ha) site at 8 Mile Road and Woodward Avenue, hosted the annual Michigan State Fair from 1905 to 2009. The fair went on hiatus in 2009 amidst funding difficulties, and returned in 2012 at a different site. Under the administration of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, the northwestern portion of the site was redeveloped into a shopping center, anchored by a Meijer store. Additional redevelopment proposals were made in the late 2010s, and much of the site was redeveloped for industrial uses by 2023.\nThe redevelopment of the State Fairgrounds was controversial. Following the construction of the shopping center, the proposals to redevelop the rest of the site for industrial use were met with resistance. Preservationists highlighted the historic value of the buildings on the site, which included the Michigan State Fairgrounds Coliseum, the Dairy Cattle Building, and a historic band shell. In 2021, the plans for the State Fairgrounds redevelopment were revised, which included retaining the Dairy Cattle Building as a new transit center, and relocating the band shell to Palmer Park. The Coliseum was demolished in 2022.\n\n\n=== Transit center ===\nThe original State Fair Transit Center, located at what is now the corner of Woodward Avenue and Remington Street, had existed since the era of the Department of Street Railways, and was once served by streetcars. Amid construction at the Fairgrounds site, which necessitated a new access street, the original Transit Center closed permanently on November 6, 2022, with only one week of public notice, and was demolished soon thereafter. A new, temporary transit center entered service the next day.\nConstruction on the new transit center began in May 2023, with extensive interior demolition of the Dairy Cattle Building. The station features a heated indoor lobby, with a ticket office and vending machine, public restrooms, and artifacts preserved from the Coliseum, including a sign, stadium seats, and a scoreboard.\n\n\n== Namesake ==\nThe transit center is named for DDOT bus driver Jason Hargrove, who died in April 2020 from complications of COVID-19. Hargrove, a father of six, had worked for DDOT since 2016, and was an active member of the Amalgamated Transit Union. He gained national attention from a viral video he posted on Facebook, in which he described being coughed on by a careless passenger, and advocated for stronger protections for DDOT bus drivers in the then-early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hargrove's video was the subject of national media coverage, highlighting the serious nature of the COVID-19 crisis, and its effect on frontline workers.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Fiorinia phantasma, the phantasma scale, is an invasive and polyphagous scale insect, apparently native to parts of south-eastern Asia and some Pacific islands. It has invaded other parts of the Pacific, Asia, the Indian Ocean, Europe and the Americas, spreading with the trade of ornamental plants. It has caused serious outbreaks on palm trees, but also infests various other woody plants, including a number of ornamentals and fruit trees like mango or lychee. \n\n\n== Distribution ==\nFiorinia phantasma was described from the Philippines in 1915, where it had been collected from Neolitsea. The first documented occurrence outside the Philippines and the first case of invasion was reported from the Hawaii Islands, where heavy infestations were reported from Oahu Island on Ligustrum japonicum in 2004, and on Pittosporum tobira in 2008. Subsequently, it was collected from 15 other plants, including a serious infestation on areca palms in 2011 on Maui Island. \nF. phantasma was again described as Fiorinia coronata from the Solomon Islands in 1988, where it infested coconut palms. It has been subsequently reported as an introduced pest from different parts of the world and seems to spread easily through the international trade with ornamental plants. It is now recorded as widespread in south-eastern Asia (southern China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia), on various Pacific islands from Papua New Guinea in the west to French Polynesia in the east, on several islands in the Indian Ocean (Maldives, Reunion), and on indoor or glasshouse plants from parts of Europe (France, Netherlands, U.K.).\nIn the Americas it has been reported from several Caribbean islands (Saint Martin, Grenada) and has also invaded Florida on the U.S. mainland. In Florida, it was first recorded as causing a serious infestation on Canary Island date palms (Phoenix canariensis) in 2018, and was later also reported from other palms and various ornamentals.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe scale cover excreted by the second instar females of F. phantasma is elongated, about 1.2 mm long and light to dark brown with a weakly developed longitudinal ridge. The body of the adult female inside the 2nd instar exuviae is wide at the thorax, but narrows abruptly at body segment III, tapering to a narrow, almost pointed pygidium at the posterior end. The body of the adult female may be yellowish, reddish or may have reddish transverse stripes. Male scales have a white scale cover like in several other species of Fiorinia.\n\nThere are several morphologically similar species of Fiorinia which cannot be separated by their scale covers or their host plants. For example, in North America Fiorinia phantasma is very similar to Fiorinia fioriniae and both commonly infest ornamental palms. However, as of 2024, F. phantasma has been only reported from Florida. For a reliable identification of F. phantasma, a slide mount and microscopic examination of the morphological details is required using the available keys. For routine field surveys, a temporary slide mount may be sufficient.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nFiorinia phantasma is polyphagous and infests the underside of the leaves, but might spread to the upper side in dense populations. It has been mainly reported from tropical woody ornamental plants, especially palm trees. ScaleNet list 25 plant families and 54 plant genera as host plants, the large majority of them from the family Arecaceae (palm trees). Infested crops include cultivated palms like coconut and areca palms, as well as fruit trees like mango or lychee. \nAs with other scale insects, only the first instar, the crawler stage, is mobile and can move to other parts of the host plant or spread by wind. The crawlers settle after a few days and start feeding on the leaves with their piercing and sucking mouthparts. The scale feeds mainly on parenchymal cells or vascular bundle tissue. Females only moult twice, to the second instar nymph and to the adult female which remains within the exuviae of the 2nd instar. Males have 2 additional instars.\nLong distance spread happens by human transport of host plants. F. phantasma is often intercepted by quarantine and also spreads frequently during the distribution of nursery plants.\n\n\n== Damage and management ==\nSerious outbreaks have been mainly reported during the first years after an introduction of Fiorinia phantasma into a new area. Infested leaves become yellow (chlorosis), they drop prematurely, and host plants may wilt and die due to the attack. In the Maldives, approximately 6000 coconut palms were heavily infested on one island, affecting fruit production. Nurseries of ornamental plants may be seriously affected, promoting spread of the pest.\nManagement of infestations is difficult, due to the scales being protected by their wax cover and important natural enemies being sensitive to chemical pesticides. Treatments with horticultural oils and insecticidal soaps as foliar spray, preferably when crawlers are most abundant, is often the best approach. Some pesticides may be suitable for soil drench.\n\n\n== Natural enemies ==\nA number of predator insects and parasitoids have been reported as natural enemies of Fiorinia phantasma. Infested plants on which abundant beneficial insects are present should not be treated with pesticides. The natural enemies include predacious lacewings, ladybugs, thrips and mite species, as well as parasitoids from the genera Aphytis and Encarsia.\n\n\n== References ==",

The team played in the Continental Hockey League and was active for two seasons in the 1970s.\n\n\n== History ==\nPekin was founded in 1964 and joined the Continental Hockey League in 1977. Their debut was a rough one, as the team lost all 34 games they played that season, though some were by forfeit as the club suspended play in early February. A change in ownership brought about a remarkable turnaround for the following season and Pekin won the league championship. Unfortunately, their success was short-lived and when further financing could not be arranged the team ceased operations after their title.\n\n\n== Season-by-season record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHockey DB",

        "content": "The 2000 Izu Islands earthquakes is an earthquake swarm that occurred around Miyake-jima, Kōzu-shima, and Nii-jima in the Izu Islands after 26 June 2000. The largest earthquake was Mw 6.5, and six earthquakes with a maximum JMA seismic intensity of Shindo 6- and Modified Mercalli intensity of VI–VII, resulting in a large-scale earthquake swarm.\n\n\n== Cause ==\nAn earthquake swarm is believed to be strongly related to volcanic activity on Miyake-jima. When seismic activity began around 18:30 JST (09:30 UTC) on 26 June, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued an volcanic information announcement at 19:33 JST (10:33 UTC) on the same day, calling for caution regarding volcanic eruptions on Miyake-jima. However, there was no immediate eruption on Miyake-jima, and the next day, discoloration of seawater believed to be caused by submarine volcanic eruptions was confirmed about 1 km off the west coast of Miyake-jima. It was believed that the seismic activity moved northwestward and the possibility of an eruption on Miyake-jima decreased, but on 8 July, an eruption occurred at the summit of Miyake-jima. The depression grew with frequent phreatic eruptions to a 550m–deep–caldera with adiameter of about 1,600 m. There were small eruptions on 13 August, 14, and on 18 August, the largest eruption occurred, followed by the second largest eruption on 29 August, leading to the evacuation of all residents on the island.\n\n\n== Seismic activity ==\nFrom around 18:30 JST (09:30 UTC) on 26 June 2000, small-scale seismic activity began with the epicenter located in the southwest of Miyake-jima. On the 27th, the epicenter shifted to the west of Miyake-jima offshore. The seismic activity also spread northwestward and intensified. From late June to August, it became significant seismic activity in the waters off the west coast of Miyake-jima, as well as near Nii-jima and Kōzu-shima. There were 30 earthquakes with a maximum JMA seismic intensity of Shindo 5- or higher (Shindo 6- occurred 6 times, Shindo 5+ occurred 7 times, and Shindo 5- occurred 17 times). The total number of earthquakes reached 14,200. Seismic activity gradually subsided after September.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nThe earthquake swarm caused collapsed houses and landslides on Nii-jima, Kōzu-shima, Shikine-jima, and Miyake-jima. The July 1 earthquake killed one person in a landslide at Kōzu-shima Village. This was the first fatality caused by an earthquake in Japan since the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995. It also injured 15 people, destroyed 15 houses, severely damaged 20 others and damaged 174 more.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of earthquakes in 2000\nList of earthquakes in Japan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe International Seismological Centre has a bibliography and/or authoritative data for this event.",

        "content": "The American League of Colored Laborers was a short-lived labor union established in New York City in 1850. It is notable for being the first union created for African Americans in the United States. Social reformer Frederick Douglass assisted in organizing the group, which held its first meeting at the Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church on June 13, 1850. Its initial officers included Samuel Ringgold Ward as president, Douglass and Lewis Woodson as vice presidents, and Henry Bibb as secretary, and during the first meeting, an executive committee was organized that was composed of several notable social reformers and abolitionists. In addition to union activities, the league was also envisioned to serve as a benefit society for black tradespeople and entrepreneurs, and to this effect, its leaders planned to establish a mutual savings bank and hold an industrial fair. Despite these plans, the union faltered shortly after its creation, and it would take until 1869 that the first successful national labor union for African Americans, the Colored National Labor Union, was formed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nIn the pre-Civil War era, many free black workers in the United States faced economic competition from both native-born white Americans and European immigrants, including Irish Americans. Additionally, African Americans were barred access to many labor unions, which only admitted white members. As a result of this, many African Americans formed mutual organizations and benevolent societies in order to assist each other economically. Examples of these organizations include the Coachman's Benevolent Society (established 1825) and the Humane Mechanics (1828) in Philadelphia, the Baltimore Caulker's Association (1838) in Baltimore, and the Colored Sailor's Home (1839) in New York City. According to historian Gerald D. Jaynes in the Encyclopedia of African American Society, these organizations can be considered \"forerunners\" or \"predecessors\" to labor unions, while labor historian Philip S. Foner stated that these groups \"resembled fraternal lodges more than trade unions\".\n\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nOn June 13, 1850, in response to the difficulties faced by African Americans in joining existing labor unions and as part of a wave of efforts towards black economic self-sufficiency and cooperation, several noted social reformers and black activists met at the Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church at the intersection of Leonard Street and Church Street to establish the American League of Colored Laborers (ALCL). The national organization would represent free African Americans who were employed in skilled trades, such as mechanics, and it is considered by historian Lerone Bennett Jr. to be the first labor union established for black people in American history. Social reformer Frederick Douglass was instrumental in establishing the organization, alongside other noted reformers and activists of the era, such as George T. Downing, Charles Bennett Ray, Charles L. Reason, James McCune Smith, and Samuel Ringgold Ward. At the initial meeting, officers for the new group were selected, with Ward as president, Douglass as vice president (a position he shared with Lewis Woodson), and Henry Bibb as secretary. Additionally, an executive committee of 23 members was selected, with plans for this group to meet monthly to discuss league business. Douglass's involvement with the organization, as well as the participation of several editors from African American newspapers, helped the union to garner fairly widespread coverage in the black press.\n\n\n=== Goals ===\nDespite being a labor union, the league had goals that differentiated it from more traditional organized labor groups. In addition to its goal of promoting unity and cooperation among black mechanics and tradespeople, the union placed a great deal of emphasis on promoting more educational opportunities within the African American community, primarily in the fields of agriculture and industry. Douglass and Ward also envisioned that the league would eventually serve as a loan-giving organization for African American entrepreneurs, and starting with their initial meeting, the union announced plans to establish funds to provide money for people trying to open their own businesses. At an 1851 meeting, the union proposed the establishment of a mutual savings bank. Additionally, the union planned to hold an industrial fair in May 1852 to showcase black industry, with the proceeds from the fair being split between the tradespeople and the union. These goals have led several historians to question how to properly categorize the league.\n\n\n=== Demise ===\nUltimately, the planned 1852 industrial fair never took place. Ultimately, the ALCL was a short-lived organization, with historian John Ernest writing in 2011 that the league disbanded shortly after its initial meeting and historian Stuart McElderry saying it \"ceased to exist during the later half of the 1800s\". Multiple reasons have been given for the league's downfall, with many historians noting that one of the largest issues facing the union was the small number of black artisans working in cities at the time. The league additionally suffered from the growth of white-only craft unions and increased European immigration that stifled the development of black industry, and McElderry additionally cites \"poor leadership and internal disputes\" within the organization. Historian Leslie M. Harris wrote in 2003 regarding the union, \"The group united reformers who held varying views regarding ways to assist black workers, but does not seem to have attracted any workers\". Ultimately, the union's demise was typical for black economic cooperative organizations of the era, as almost all such groups during this time were short-lived. Multiple historians have noted that the league's demise could be viewed as indicative of a growing class divide between the workers and the social reformers in the African American community during this time.\n\n\n=== Later African American unionization efforts ===\nIn the years following the ALCL's demise, unionization efforts continued among African Americans, in particular among longshoremen in port cities such as Charleston, South Carolina, and New Orleans. In 1869, the Knights of Labor became the first white union to allow black people to join, though the union offered little support to its black members, as demonstrated in the events leading up to the Thibodaux massacre. Also in 1869, black activists met in Washington, D.C., in a conference that eventually led to the creation of the Colored National Labor Union, which Bennett cites as \"[t]he first major national effort\" towards a black nationwide union. Douglass would later serve as president of this union. As of 2019, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists represents the interests of many African American union members in over 50 different unions, with labor journalist Kim Kelly calling the group \"a bridge between the labor movement and the black community\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nAfrican Americans in New York City\nColored Conventions Movement\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nChandler, D.

After heating the ingredients with black pepper and salt, the food is ready. You can also use pumpkin instead of eggplant. Yatimcha is very similar to the French dish of ratatouille.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChighitma\n\n\n== References ==",

This new work imagines what the masks would have said.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\"Under the White Mask\" is a short film that uses excerpts from \"Under The Black Mask\", a 1958 film about Congolese art, directed by Belgian artist Paul Haesaerts and considered colonial propaganda. This new film imagines what the masks, now subjects and no longer objects, would say. \"Under the White Mask\" limits itself to elements that already existed in 1958.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was produced by Cobra films with help from the Museum aan de Stroom. The masks used in the film are from the Museum aan de Stroom. In addition, Aimé Césaire's book \"Discourse on Colonialism\" is discussed in Lingala.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe film can be seen on the New York Times series called Op-Docs.",

        "content": "The Captaincy of Alagoas (Portuguese: Capitania de Alagoas) was created on September 16, 1817, from the dismemberment of the Captaincy of Pernambuco. The capital was located in the current city of Marechal Deodoro under the name of Santa Maria Madalena da Lagoa do Sul.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe coast of the current state of Alagoas was reached by Portuguese navigators in 1501. At the time, it became a target for European brazilwood smugglers. In 1534, after the Portuguese Crown established the Hereditary Captaincy system for the colonization of Brazil, the territory of Alagoas became part of the Captaincy of Pernambuco. Its occupation dates back to the foundation of the town of Penedo in 1545 by the donatário Duarte Coelho Pereira, located on the banks of the São Francisco River, and to the establishment of sugar mills by the German Cristóvão Lins in the southern region of the territory.\nIn 1556, the site witnessed the sinking of the ship Nossa Senhora da Ajuda and the massacre of the survivors, including the bishop Dom Pero Fernandes Sardinha, by the Caeté people. The episode provided motivation for the war of extermination waged against the indigenous people by the Portuguese Crown. At the beginning of the 17th century, the Alagoas region produced a significant amount of sugar cane, manioc flour, tobacco, cattle and dried fish. During the second Dutch invasion of Brazil, the coast became the scene of violent fighting. Inland, the quilombos established by Africans escaping from the mills of Pernambuco and Bahia proliferated. Palmares, the most famous, numbered 20,000 people. In 1711, the territory became the Comarca of Alagoas, still subordinate to Pernambuco.\nOn September 16, 1817, after the Pernambuco Revolution, Alagoas achieved independence. The first governor, Sebastião Francisco de Melo e Póvoas, took office on January 22, 1819. The first capital was established in the town of Santa Maria Madalena da Lagoa do Sul, later called Alagoas (now Marechal Deodoro). On February 28, 1821, it became a province. During the Empire, it suffered the effects of movements such as the Confederation of the Equator and the Cabanada. The Provincial Law of December 9, 1839, transferred the capital of the province from the city of Alagoas to the village of Maceió, which was elevated to city status. In 1889, after the Proclamation of the Republic, it became a state.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCaptaincies of Brazil\nHistory of Alagoas\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAlves Filho, Ivan (2000).

        "content": "Postwar World (Korean: 전쟁 이후의 세계) is a Korean-language book by Pak Noja, Russian-Korean scholar and professor of University of Oslo. It discusses the impact of the 2022 to present Russian invasion of Ukraine and its impact on the world order.\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\nHe argues that major wars between powerful nations tend to happen every 30 to 50 years, as the dominant world order weakens.\nHe points several historical examples:\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars led to a two-power system with Britain and Russia at the center. But the Crimean War chipped away at Russia's dominance, allowing Britain to take the lead.\nGermany's victory in the Franco-Prussian War challenged Britain, but Germany's defeat in World War I also led to Britain losing its top spot to the United States.\nAfter World War II, the US and the Soviet Union became the two superpowers during the Cold War. But with the Cold War's end, the US emerged as the sole superpower.\nHowever, Park observes that this US-led unipolar system is being challenged by major non-Western powers like China, Russia, and Iran. This is reflected in ongoing conflicts between major powers, such as the Israel-Palestine conflict, the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and the recent war in Ukraine. Park suggests that these events signal a shift towards a new multipolar world order, beginning around 2022.\nIn addition, unlike some Korean \"left\" figures who evaluate the Russia-Ukraine war as \"Russia's self-rescue measure against the West\" and the Putin regime as a \"progressive alternative\" to neoliberalism, he strongly criticizes the unethical nature of the Putin regime. The reality of Russia, where the rights of non-regular workers and platform workers are violated and the oppression of democratic unions is fierce, and the massacres, targeted assassinations, illegal confinement, and forced migration committed by the Putin regime in Ukraine are mentioned. But some Korean leftists have positive views on Putin's Russia. He emphasizeds that these illusions must be abandoned. Nevertheless, the author argues that for the peace on the Korean Peninsula, although Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a clearly crime, South Korea must abandon \"blind obedience to the United States\" and restore diplomatic relations with Russia.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nReporter Kim Han-byeol of the JoongAng daily agreed with the author's explanation on why the war continues despite the international sanctions against Russia and why support for the war is high within Russia. But he disagree on the argument that for peace on the Korean Peninsula, \"blind obedience to the United States\" must be abandoned and relations with Russia must be restored.\nYang Seon-ah, a reporter for the Hankyoreh newspaper, said that in this book, the Russian author kindly pointed out the ideological identity and goals of the regime deep in the consciousness of the Putin regime. At the same time, it also reported the current status of Russian civil society and wrote that it well explains why there is no noticeable strong anti-war movement or movement against the regime in Russia even though the surveillance and oppression of the Putin regime continues.\nThe left wing Korean newspaper, Redian reviewed that this book will serve as a reliable compass for readers who are curious about what the ‘postwar world’ will look like and the path Korea should take.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Lonely at the Top\" is a song by Nigerian artist Asake from his second studio album Work of Art (2023). The song was released on June 16, 2023, through YBNL Nation and Empire Distribution. It was the first song to hit 100 million streams on Audiomack. As of September 2023, the song was the longest-running number-one song on Nigerian Radio Chart. It was also number one on the TurnTable Official Top 100, an aggregate chart that combines TV, radio and streaming platforms. It spent 12 weeks at number one. It was also one of the most streamed songs on Spotify in Nigeria.\nIt was also the most searched song of 2023 in Nigeria.\nOn November 15, 2023, a remix of the song with American R&B singer H.E.R was released. In April 2024, British rapper, Stormzy, sampled the song in his track \"Cry No More\", featuring British rapper Headie One.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe song addresses the feelings of loneliness, emptiness and distrust associated with success and therefore being at the top.\nKareem of The Guardian explains that the song explores themes of ambition and resilience in Asake's pursuit of success, making the song relatable. Asake mentions the challenges he faced in the pursuit of success through lyrics like \"I would cheer on the road chasing my dream because I know no one can chase it for me\"  Alexis Petridis of the Guardian explains that the lyrics suggest that Asake is unbothered by the alienating effects of fame and looks forward to being an even greater celebrity\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe song produced by Blaisebeatz is described to have a \"backing choir\" and \"introspective instrumentation\". Tomide Marv of Zikoko Magazine, describes Lonely at the top as a solemn but groovy song.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nRolling Stone named it as one of the best 40 Afropop songs of 2023, terming it as a refreshing detour from the usual amapiano sound that Asake is known for.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\nOn July 2023, Asake performed a live medley of \"Lonely at the Top\" on Vevo Ctrl. In November 2023, Asake and H.E.R, had an acoustic performance of the remix which was uploaded on YouTube.On 1st February 2024, Asake performed the song on the Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "King Baabu is a play by Wole Soyinka amongst his others plays including  The Lion and the Jewel,A Dance of the Forests, and The Strong Breed. Wole Soyinka was the first African to win the Nobel Prize award in 1986. King Baabu is a satirical play that mirrors the rule of General Abacha in Nigeria through absurdity and humor. It follows the transformation of General Basha Bash into King Baabu, portraying his  reign with a cast of characters speaking in a childish language. Through comedy and storytelling, the play critiques power, corruption, and the cult of personality, leaving a lasting impression as a poignant commentary on political absurdity.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKing Baabu takes center stage on serving as a mirror reflecting the dictatorial rule of General Basha Bash, a thinly veiled portrayal of Nigeria's General Abacha. The play starts with General Basha Bash, who, following a military coup, sheds his military garb for regal robes and crowns himself King Baabu. With his newfound power, Baabu plunges the nation into a surreal world of  tyranny.\nAs King Baabu's regime runs out of control, the people, once oppressed by General Basha Bash, now find themselves subjected to the whims of a ruler even more absurd and outrageous. Yet, despite the absurdity, they had no choice than to compile\nThrough \"King Baabu,\" Soyinka blends satire, comedy, and social commentary, offering an indictment of dictatorship and the abuse of power. As the curtain falls, the audience is left to ponder the timeless lesson in the theater of politics, absurdity often reigns supreme.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nKing Baabu (formerly General Basha Bash): The central character of the play, a cruel ruler who seizes power in a coup and transforms himself into a flamboyant king.\nPotipoo: The court jester, whose antics provide comic relief throughout the play.\n General Uzi: A loyal lackey of King Baabu, known for his blind allegiance and unquestioning obedience.\n\n\n== Setting ==\nKing Baabu is set in a fictional version of Nigeria during the rule of General Abacha, although it's more of a satirical commentary than a strict representation of historical events. The story revolves around General Basha Bash, who stages a coup and declares himself King Baabu, symbolizing the arbitrary and dictatorial nature of his rule.\nThe setting reflects the political turmoil and authoritarianism displayed during General Abacha's regime, with parallels drawn between the events in the novel and real-life political dynamics. The use of a childish language for the characters, reminiscent of Alfred Jarry's \"Ubu Roi,\" adds to the satirical tone of the narrative, highlighting the absurdity of the situation.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nAuthoritarianism and Dictatorship: The novel explores the consequences of unchecked power and the abuse of authority by depicting General Basha Bash's transformation into King Baabu. It delves into the absurdity and oppression of dictatorial regimes.\nPolitical Satire: Using satire, the novel critiques the political landscape of Nigeria under General Abacha's rule, as well as broader themes of corruption and nepotism in governance. It employs humor and exaggeration to highlight societal issues and political absurdities.\nLanguage and Communication: The use of a childish language for the characters underscores themes of manipulation and propaganda. It reflects how language can be distorted and controlled by those in power to maintain their authority and suppress dissent.\nResistance and Rebellion: Amidst the satire, the novel also touches on themes of resistance and rebellion against oppressive regimes. It portrays characters who challenge the status quo and fight for freedom and justice, despite the absurdity of their circumstances.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "McClure and the Parson, or Duncan McClure and the Poor Parson, is a 1916 Australian stage play adapted from the Steele Rudd story Duncan McClure and the Poor Parson (under which title the play originally debuted). Rudd himself did the adaptation. The play was presented by Bert Bailey who had great success adapting Rudd's On Our Selection.\nThe play debuted in 1916 and there were regular revivals thereafter.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewing a 1916 production Punch said \"The characters are all typically Australian, and if thev arc slightly overdrawn the exaggeration may be pardoned for the amount of fun which the strong drawing causes.\" The Sydney Morning Herald said it \"has less plot in it than its companion picture of out-back life, On Our Selection, and it tolles even more evidently upon a succession of practical jokes; but it is a wonderful laugh maker.\"\nReviewing a 1918 production the Age said the play \"cannot be considered seriously, but audiences seem none the less pleased with\nit. Its humor is of the brond type, depending upou incongruity of character and incident more than wit. The plot is a flimsy thing— a simple story of love and a forgery, which scarcely serves to string the four acts together — but in such a play plot docs not matter. There could be no doubt about the enjoyment of the audience.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tha'ran Ya'ub Yuhan'im (Arabic: ثأران يعب يهنعم) was a ruler of the ancient Kingdoms of Saba' and Dhu-Raydan, which was located in present-day Yemen. The earliest mention of Tha'ran are inscriptions from the year 155 CE as part of a co-regency with his father, Dhamar Ali Yahbur. He went on to succeed his father around 175 CE, and ruled alone until 214.\n\n\n== Reign ==\n\n\n=== Co-regency ===\nTha'ran entered power firstly as a co-regent under his father, Dhamar Ali Yahbur. There are two inscriptions regarding the Sabaeans pledging allegiance to Tha'ran and Dhamar Ali, found at the Temple of Awwam. During this reign, both father and son ordered that repairs be done for the Ma'rib Dam.\n\n\n=== Single reign ===\nTha'ran took power as single ruler around 175 CE, and eventually he stylized his throne name as Tha'ran Ya'ub Yuhan'im. He also became affiliated with the tribe of Himyar. In 180–185 CE, the rebel prince Rabb Shams Nimran launched war on Himyar's lands as a retaliation against the actions of Tha'ran Ya'ub Yuhan'im. In 212 CE, Tha'ran sent a diplomatic delegation to the Kingdom of Hadhramaut to congratulate the new ruler Il'azz Yalit II. His rule ended in 214 CE, with Lazm Yanuf Yuhasd'iq taking the throne in the same year.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nLife-sized statues of Dhamar Ali Yahbur and Tha'ran Ya'ub Yuhan'im made out of bronze were created by Greek sculptors in collaboration with a local bronze caster named Lahay'amm. \nThe later Himyarite ruler, Abu Karib, once lamented Tha'ran:\n\nTha'ran Yahbur has been mine to follow, the virtues of the covenant and mastery.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rulers of Saba' and Himyar\n\n\n== References ==",

Gilles De Valck and Francoise Hoste have been part of the team since 2015, contributing to the development of original film projects.\n\n\n=== Work method ===\nCobra Films begins by meeting with filmmakers to assess their level of commitment to their projects. If the company decides to co-produce a project, they will share the financial risks involved. In essence, Cobra Films will establish a budget for the filmmaker. If the allocated budget proves insufficient for the film, both the director and the producers will incur losses.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Carr–Peters scandal is an ongoing diplomatic and political scandal in Australasia, between Bob Carr, formerly Australian minister for Foreign Affairs and premier of New South Wales, and Winston Peters, New Zealand's current deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs. The scandal began with an initial incident on 2 May 2024, when Peters appeared on RNZ to discuss proposals to join Pillar 2 of AUKUS, a military pact Carr has strongly opposed, and allegedly defamed Carr by calling him \"nothing more than a Chinese puppet\", among other now-redacted insults. The event has been a source of major controversy in New Zealand.\nA transcript of the interview and articles it spawned were rapidly censored after Carr accused Peters of libel. Peters stood by his statement about Carr at questions for oral answer in Parliament. After mulling over legal action, Carr announced later the same day would indeed be suing Peters. Peters then ridiculed such threats and compared Carr to Chumbawamba, an English band which had not followed through on threats to sue Peters for using their song 'Tubthumping' for political purposes without permission. In New Zealand there have been calls from the opposition for Peters to be stood down as a minister. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has refused calls to dismiss Peters, his crucial coalition government partner, and has said that he was sure Carr \"understands the rough and tumble of politics\".\n\n\n== References ==",

The book delves into the theory of evolution, it's development and history, the evidences for it, the objections against it, the controversies surrounding it, opinions both in support of and against it from other religious denominations, Muslim's views towards it, and how it can be reconciled with the Islamic faith. The book has seen popularity in recent times due to it's well documentation of the theory of evolution and religious (particularly Muslim's) views towards it.\nThe book's writer, Shoaib Ahmed Malik, is a Muslim theologian and a theistic evolutionist (alternatively evolutionary creationist). His ideas regarding evolution theory are reconcilable with any schools of theology and Islamic sects, although strong emphasis has been put on Ash'arism. The book starts by giving the readers a basic idea about the evolution theory and the evidences for it and why the scientific consensus supports it so much. Then, the book goes through a basic look at the history of evolutionary thought. The book then reviews various criticisms of the evolution theory. Here, Malik gives counter-criticism, debunking all of the mentioned objections against evolution. He also debunked various misconceptions about the theory and it's history in various sections by this point. Then, the following chapters takes a slight look at Christian theology and focuses on Christian views towards evolution and creationism. Here, the concept of intelligent design is introduced and explained. Then, the book delves into Islamic theology, Islamic sects and schools of theology (especially Ash'arism) to give the reader a basic idea about Islamic theology and how can one come under any kinds of theological conclusions and how to theologically review anything. The book then looks at various Muslim's views towards the evolution theory and what various Muslims, particularly scholars and scientists, have to say for it. Then, Malik discusses about various metaphysical considerations and explains how Islam and the theory of evolution can be made compatible.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Putbus Palace (German: Schloss Putbus) is a former neoclassical palace in Putbus, on the isle of Rügen in Germany. It was the seat of the princes of Putbus and the Putbus family in the city they founded in 1810, Putbus, which is also known as the White city of Rügen. During the communist period in East Germany, the palace was demolished in 1962 due to political reasons, and the remains were removed by 1964.\nToday, the outline of the building in the green space and the lakeside terrace are still visible. In 2019, an association was founded for the reconstruction of the palace. A feasibility study was presented in November 2023, and the association is now raising public awareness and raising funding.\nPutbus palace is also known as the palace behind the elderberry grove (German: Das Schloss hinter dem Holunderbusch).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nThe first stronghold at Putbus was already there around 1200, in the times when Rügen was a Danish principality, ruled by the Wends. The Putbus family was a collateral line of the princely house. The name ‘‘Putbus’’ first appeared in 1286 and was adopted by all members of the family in the mid-14th century. With the extinction of the princes of Rügen in 1325, the family gained a leading role among the noble families of Rügen. They became the largest land owners on the island of Rügen, which they remained until the communist takeover after the Second World War.\nThey choose the Putbus stronghold as their main seat and constructed there a stone house, which was mentioned multiple times in documents from around 1371. It was a rectangular solid building located exactly in the middle of an area enclosed by a moat.\nThe documented designation of the building changed in 1416 from \"house\" to \"castle”. In the 15th century, the castle was rebuilt in Gothic style. Between 1584 and 1594, Ludwig von Putbus added the southwestern wing to castle.\n\n\n=== 17th and 18th century ===\n\nAt the start of the 17th century, the castle was rebuilt into a three-winged complex. The lords of Putbus were created counts of Holy Roman Empire in 1727, and counts in Sweden in 1731.\nIn 1725, count Moritz Ulrich von Putbus (1699–1769) renewed the castle in baroque style, with only the Gothic wing and the Renaissance part remaining. Also, he established a park in French formal style, including a belvedere (demolished around 1804/ 1805) and ice cellar (demolished in 1819).\n\n\n=== 19th century: Wilhelm Malte I ===\n\nIn 1807, count Wilhelm Malte I von Putbus (1783–1854) was created prince (Fürst) by king Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, Duke of Swedish Pomerania. In 1815, the Prussian king Frederick William III (1770–1840) recognized the princely title, after his assumption of power in Swedish Pomerania (now part of the Duchy of Pomerania as a province of Prussia). Wilhelm Malte I was the last governor general of the province of Swedish Pomerania before it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815 as New Western Pomerania and Rügen. He had actually been picked to continue running the affairs of the province under its new rulers.\nIn 1810, Wilhelm Malte founded the town of Putbus next to the palace, and developed it into a luxury seaside resort like Bad Doberan and Heiligendamm. It opened in 1816. The city was designed in neoclassical style and became known as the \"White Town\" (German: Weiße Stadt).\nFrom 1827 to 1832, the palace was redesigned by the Berlin architect Johann Gottfried Steinmeyer, who influenced it in the neoclassical style. In addition, from 1819 to 1821, the residence theatre was built and modified in 1826. The princely stables were built between 1821 and 1824, and were home to prince Malte's horses. The palace church was created between 1844 and 1846. And finally, from 1824 to 1853, the prince also constructed an orangery near the palace.\nThe park was also transformed into an English landscape garden. English landscape gardens, as a conscious contrast to the previously dominant French-style baroque gardens, were very popular in Germany towards the end of the 18th and throughout the 19th century. The orchestrated park landscape of trees, bushes, flowers, meadows, water surfaces, paths, and squares was intended to represent an alternative world to the usual harsh reality. The prince resided in Berlin during the winter from 1816 onwards and was also inspired by the ideas of Prussian parks. In 1823, he became a member of the Association for the Promotion of Horticulture in the Royal Prussian States of Prussia (short: Berlin Horticultural Association).\nWilhelm Malte I also constructed the nearby located Granitz Hunting Lodge.\n\n\n=== 19th century: Wilhelm Malte II ===\n\n \n\n \n \nAfter the death of Prince Wilhelm Malte on 26 September 1854, the House of Putbus went extinct in the male line. In 1861 by decision of king Wilhelm I of Prussia the succession to the house of Putbus was passed down to Wilhelm Malte II (1833–1907) and he was given the title of Prince (Fürst) of Putbus. Wilhelm Malte II was the grandson of Wilhelm Malte I through his daughter Clothilde von Putbus (1809–1894), who was married to count Hermann Friedrich von Wylich und Lottum (1796–1849).\nA fire – probably caused by a later installed hot air heating system – destroyed large parts of the new castle on 23 December 1865. The Berlin architect J. Pavelt was chosen for the reconstruction, which was completed in 1872 in the Neoclassical style. The central courtyard was demolished, and a hall was created, followed by a terraced area at the rear, staggered six times towards the Swan Pond. This also led to the loss of the last remnants of the medieval \"Stone House\".\nThere were close relations between the Prussian royal house and the Putbus family. King Frederick William IV visited the princely residence as crown prince in 1820, 1825 and in 1843, 1846, and 1853 as king. The close ties between Putbus and Berlin were further strengthened under Wilhelm Malte II in 1860, still under the reign of Princess Luise, Crown Prince Frederick and his wife Victoria visited the princely palace in Putbus.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\nUntil 1944, the palace was owned and lived in by the Putbus family, and was also centre of the princely administration, but it was placed under forced administration by the NSDAP after the imprisonment of Malte, the 5th prince of Putbus (1889–1945) for his involvement in the 20 July plot, the assassination attempt on Hitler. He was killed in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp on 10 February 1945.\nWith the end of World War II, looting occurred, and as there was no immediate use planned, material removal and decay began.\n\n\n=== East Germany ===\n\nThe communist government in East Germany confiscated the palace and the estate that extended over a sixth of the island of Rügen.\nIn 1948, artists from the Berlin-Weißensee Art Academy, with Werner Laux, worked in the palace. From 2 November 1948, Studio 48 of the State Drama School Schwerin under the direction of Heinz Kahlow was added. With the final examinations in spring 1951, as part of the reorganization of drama schools in East Germany, the branch in Putbus palace was closed.\nIn 1955, there was an attempt to restore the castle in neoclassical style, but the measure was not completed. In 1957, the demolition of the palace was decided for ideological and financial reasons. The building was demolished in 1962, and the remains were removed by 1964. Subsequently, the castle square was levelled, leaving only the lakeside terrace.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\nFrom the 1990s onwards, the palace park underwent restoration. Vistas were created towards the Greifswald Bay, the swan pond was expanded and provided with an artificial island accessible via a bridge. An old beech tree was saved in the Komtessgarten.\nMany exotic trees have been planted in the extensive park, including more than 60 different species such as giant and primeval sequoias, cedars, yellow-flowering horse chestnuts, and tulip trees. Access to the park and wildlife enclosure is free of charge.\n\n\n== Reconstruction plans ==\nIn December 2019, the ‘‘Friends of the Princely Palace of Putbus’’ association presented plans to reconstruct the palace for approximately 60 million euros. According to the association's spokesperson, Torsten Seegert, many citizens had expressed their willingness to participate in the project and pledged donations. In January 2020, a donation account was set up for this purpose In 2021, the universities of Greifswald and Vienna conducted studies on the castle square, including drone surveys of the area.\nThe association commissioned a feasibility study from the architects and engineers' office IPROConsult, which, according to the association, was already involved in the reconstruction of the Frauenkirche in Dresden. The state government funded the study. It was presented in November 2023, estimated reconstruction costs at 40 to 50 million euros, and suggesting to use the reconstructed palace as hotel or (government) offices.\nThe association is now raising public awareness and raising funding.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nLoebe, Viktor (1910).

It is the official aid organisation of the Burkinabè Catholic Church with a presence all over the country.\nIt is a member of the global Caritas Internationalis confederation and of the regional Caritas Africa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origin of the organisation dates back to 1956, when the French Secours catholique established a delegation in what was then French Upper Volta. After the independence of the Republic of Upper Volta, this delegation took the name of Caritas voltaïque in 1961.\nA separate structure, the Bureau d'étude et de liaison (\"Research and Liaison Office\", BEL) was founded in 1973. In 1998, at the initiative of the Bishops Conference, the current structure was established by mergeing the BEL and Caritas. It was officially recognised as non-profit association by the State on 25 May 1998.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nCaritas Burkina Faso is the national Caritas organisation and federates its 15 diocesan Caritas organisations with their 200 Caritas parish branches. The diocesan bodies and the General Secretariat of Caritas Burkina Faso operate independently and function through delegation, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.\nThe diocesan Caritas organisations are called Secrétariats exécutifs diocésains or SED (\"Diocesan Executive Secretariats\").

Its initiatives span across multiple sectors such as agriculture, emergency assistance and humanitarian aid, access to essential social services, microfinance, reintegration and rehabilitation of vulnerable individuals, food security, and promoting women's rights in a Sahelian environment challenged by extreme variability and climate change. \nDespite its Catholic affiliation, Caritas Burkina Faso serves all communities indiscriminately, irrespective of gender, religion, or ethnicity.\nIn 2018, its services reached 1,5 million direct beneficiaries. The total budget for the organisations programmes has increased over the years, from 5 billion West African CFA francs in 2009, to 7 billion francs in 2015 and 9.5 billion francs in 2018.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in French)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Antonio Sinforiano Timotio Luis Fernandes (22 August 1930 – 11 March 1981), known professionally as Antonio Sinforiano or A. Sinforiano, was an Indian playwright, theatrical producer, ghostwriter, composer, prompter, and stagehand known for his work in tiatr productions staged post-liberation.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAntonio Sinforiano Timotio Luis Fernandes was born on 22 August 1930 in Navelim, Goa, which was part of Portuguese India during the Portuguese Empire, to landlords Conceiçaõ Manoel Fernandes and Maria Santana Graciana Josefa Rebelo, who hailed from Varca, Goa, into a Goan Catholic family. Fernandes was the fourth of four children, with his elder brothers Gabriel (born 1923) and Jeronimo \"Jerry\" (born 1926), and a sister Maria (born 1928).  After finishing his education at a religious school, Fernandes continued his studies in Margão, where his parents lived. He successfully completed his High School education, known as Segundo Grau, in the Portuguese language.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFernandes, known for his intellectual prowess and accessibility, was regularly sought out by folk playwrights and tiatrists (artists specializing in tiatr performances) to assess and provide feedback on their scripts. This interaction sparked his interest in tiatr, a distinctive form of Goan musical theater. Consequently, Fernandes initiated his involvement in tiatr by authoring scripts, crafting songs, and offering ghostwriting services to tiatrists, demonstrating his multifaceted contributions to the theatrical landscape. Driven by his passion for tiatr, he immersed himself in the world of theatrical productions, taking on the tasks of a prompter and backstage assistant, embodying the role of a stagehand in the theater environment. Fernandes remained dedicated to the Konkani theater scene, commonly referred to as the tiatr stage, by independently creating and presenting his own tiatrs as a theatrical producer. Among his popular works were Rozarachem Kont (The Rosary Beads), directed by Konkani singer and writer Kid Boxer, Maim, Tum Asli Zalear (Mother, If You Were There), Oso Cholta Ho Sounsar (This Is How the World Works), Disop Vortounam Zavop, Map Bhortoch Vot'ta, and others. On 5 November 1972, Fernandes presented his self-written and directed tiatr, Boreponn (Goodness), near Nuvem church. The staging of this tiatr production was made possible with the assistance of the Santos Sports Club. The cast included Babina, Luiza, Clara Dias, Jephsis Hitler, Lucian, Greg de Candolim, Valento Luis Rod, C de Sanquelim, Roam-Rem-Rod, Domnic Vaz, Lume Gomes, C. D'Silva, Master Vaz, Albert de Cana, and J X Miranda. Luciano served as the stage manager, while the music arrangements were executed by Alex's band.\nDuring the period in which Fernandes was active, the Konkani tiatr stage saw a significant reliance on prompters for the delivery of dialogues by performers. These prompters, including Fernandes, were engaged by directors and played a vital role in the production process. Their primary responsibility was to provide timely cues to the performers, ensuring that the lines were delivered accurately and on time. Prompters like Fernandes possessed the ability to convey the precise emotional nuances required for each character, enhancing the overall performance. The demand for prompters of Fernandes' caliber was substantial, and directors would secure their services well in advance, starting from the rehearsal stage and continuing throughout the entire duration of the performances. Fernandes and his contemporaries frequently traveled with the tiatr troupes, joining them as they performed in diverse locations. In addition to their prompting duties, prompters often provided valuable input by offering suggestions and making necessary corrections to the dialogues. The role of prompters extended beyond dialogue delivery. In addition to overseeing the tiatr program, they were in charge of managing stage transitions, coordinating the availability of props, and other essential elements necessary for a successful tiatr performance. Their meticulous attention to detail and careful approach were instrumental in ensuring the smooth and seamless execution of the tiatr show. What made Fernandes stand out among other prompters was his versatility as a writer and composer. In addition to his prompter responsibilities, he possessed the talent to create original content and compose music for the tiatr.\nFernandes played a significant role in fostering and promoting emerging talents within the Konkani tiatr community. One notable individual he supported was Clara Dias, an actress and singer who made her debut on the Konkani stage during the early 1960s. Fernandes offered her encouragement and guidance during the early stages of her career. Moreover, he actively sought to introduce promising artists in his own theatrical productions. For instance, he provided a platform for Josephine Dias, daughter of playwright Casiano, to make her first appearance on the commercial tiatr stage in the 1960s with the production Maim Tum Asli Zalear (Mother, If You Were There). Fernandes also played a pivotal role in providing opportunities for aspiring tiatr artist Eddie Mascarenhas. In one of his tiatr performances held at the Colva Fama, also known as Fama De Menino Jesus, Fernandes afforded Mascarenhas the chance to showcase his singing talent. Mascarenhas received admiration from the audience for his rendition, effectively launching his career in the Konkani tiatr industry. Furthermore, Fernandes made contributions to the tiatr community beyond his own productions. On 4 February 1967, he assumed the role of a stage manager for the tiatr production Adim Chintunk Nam! (Didn't Think Before). Later in his career, Fernandes became involved in theater competitions, serving as a judge for the Kala Academy Goa's 3rd Tiatr Competition held during the 1976–1977 season. This competition took place across three venues: the Kala Academy Theatre in Panjim, Gomant Vidya Niketan in Margao, and Zopha Mandop in Canacona. Collaborating with judges Krishna L. Moye and Albert Carvalho, Fernandes contributed his expertise to evaluate the performances showcased in the competition.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFernandes was recognized for his erudition and intellectual pursuits. During his formative years, he relocated to Margão, Goa, where he pursued his high school education while residing with his parents. However, at the age of 48, around the year 1978, he decided to leave the city and establish his residence in Varca, Goa, his mother's hometown. Fernandes's older brother, Jeronimo \"Jerry,\" decided to pursue a similar path, starting out as a prompter and backstage assistant before transitioning to become a playwright and director. Additionally, Fernandes's sister-in-law, Filomena Lopes, who entered into matrimony with Jerry, actively participated in the Konkani stage as an actress and singer. After their wedding, she took part in the theatrical performances produced by Fernandes. \nAccording to Fausto V. Da Costa, the author of Tiatr 125th Anniversary Commemorative Volume, Fernandes died on 11 March 1981, at the age of 50, at his residence in Varca. However, a death certificate bearing similarities to Fernandes's and his father's names indicates an alternate account, suggesting that he may have died at the Goa Medical College in Bambolim, Goa. The absence of secondary sources makes it challenging to corroborate this claim. Initially, Da Costa had stated in his writings that Fernandes was born in the village of Varca; however, the birth certificate points to his birthplace as the town of Navelim, Goa. Consequently, uncertainty lingers regarding the precise location of Fernandes's death.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Nadezhda Dmitrievna Subbotina (Russian: Надежда Дмитриевна Субботина; 1855–c. 1930) was a Russian Narodnik revolutionary. Born into a noble family, she went abroad to receive an education in philosophy at the University of Zurich, where she became involved in revolutionary circles. After returning to Russia, she moved through various towns and cities, where she conducted anti-Tsarist propaganda, for which she was arrested and prosecuted first in the Trial of the 193 and then in the Trial of the 50. She was exiled to Tomsk Governorate, where she spent most of the 1880s, before returning to European Russia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNadezhda Dmitrievna Subbotina was born in 1855, in the village of Podvorgolskoye, in the Oryol Governorate of the Russian Empire. She was the youngest daughter of a noble landowner, Dmitrii Subbotin, who died shortly after her birth, leaving his children with a considerable inheritance. The girls' mother, Sofya Subbotina, endeavoured to provide them with the best possible education, enrolling them at a girls' school in Moscow in 1868.\nShe never formally graduated from school, as in 1873, she travelled abroad with her mother to Switzerland, where she was reunited with her sisters Evgeniia and Maria. She settled in Zurich, where she took classes on philosophy at the University of Zurich, worked on Pyotr Lavrov's magazine Vpered and joined the Fritschi women's circle. In 1874, she returned to Russia, following a summons from the government. She briefly settled in the capital of Saint Petersburg, before returning home to Podvorgolskoye in order to conduct propaganda. As she was surveilled by the police, she decided to move to Oryol, where she joined the revolutionary circle of Pyotr Zaichnevsky.\nShe subsequently moved to Belomestnoye and then to Tetyushi, where she lived for a while with Lydia Figner, before moving on to Kazan. She was arrested there on 23 September 1874, and prosecuted for anti-government propaganda in the Trial of the 193. She was released, but kept under police surveillance.\nWhile the case was resolved, in the summer of 1875, she moved to Odesa, where she joined another revolutionary circle and helped to smuggle radical literature into the country from abroad. She then moved to Moscow, where she carried out propaganda work for the All-Russian Socialist Revolutionary Organisation. On 7 August 1875, she was arrested and again prosecuted for anti-government propaganda, for which she was held in pre-trial detention in Butyrka prison, where she participated in a prison riot. She was transferred to Saint Petersburg, where, on 30 November 1876, she was charged for anti-government propaganda in the Trial of the 50 and sentenced to exile in Tomsk province. In September 1877, she was transferred to Narym, but as she had fallen ill, she was instead taken to Naimsk. In July 1880, she moved to the city of Tomsk, where she married Stepan Mokievskyy-Zubok. On 7 January 1881, she was arrested after she had been named as a member of Narodnaya Volya. She returned to European Russia in 1889. After the establishment of the Soviet Union, in 1930, she became a member of the Society of Former Political Prisoners and Exiled Settlers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

It is located on Rue de Gamelin near the Hull Hospital. It was founded in 1998 to the \"request of parents.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nDue to popular demand from parents in Collège Saint-Alexandre since 1992, the school was originally founded in 1997 as Collège préuniversitaire Saint-Alexandre to give students preuniversitary classes. In October 2000, the school rebranded to Collège préuniversitaire Nouvelles-Frontières. Due to big demand for a privatized secondary school in the region, the school administrators decided to start a new secondary section in the school. They moved inside the old D'Arcy McGee school and the college section has  moved to another address.\nIn 2013, the school has become one of the only schools in the region to adopt the utilisation of the iPad in school hours.\nIn 2022, it invested into expanding the school.\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "content": "Musa Mahmoud al-Shabandar (Arabic: موسى الشابندر) was an Iraqi politician who held various positions in Iraqi governments during the Kingdom of Iraq period, including serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs several times between 1941 and 1955. He's also the founder of what would become the Shabandar Coffeehouse.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMusa al-Shabandar was born in the Jadid Hassan Pasha locality in Baghdad, located near al-Ma'mun Street and a locality of merchants and respected Baghdadi nobles. His father was Mahmoud al-Shabandar, a wealthy Baghdadi land and property owner. Musa was the al-Shabandar family's eldest son and played games with his siblings, including his younger brother Ibrahim al-Shabandar. Musa used to occupy his father to coffeehouses and he would listen to conversations in the coffeehouse. He would attend several schools and learn the Quran, several languages, and history at a young age under several Baghdadi scholars.\nAl-Shabandar spoke English, French, and German and would soon move to Berlin in the Weimer Republic after the Armistice of 11 November 1918 was signed. He would move back to Baghdad in 1932 where he was appointed in the Iraqi delegation in the League of Nations.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nOn 10 October 1933, al-Shabandar was appointed as the consul of Switzerland by the Iraqi government. In 1937, al-Shabandar was accused of giving certificates of export to Iraq for munitions meant to reach Spain. As a result, he was recalled and put under house arrest. Although the proceedings against him were dropped he became the deputy for Amarah until 1939.\nAfter Rashid Ali al-Gaylani took over the Iraqi government during the 1941 Iraqi Golden Square coup d'état, al-Shabandar became the foreign minister. Al-Shabandar stood out from the rest of al-Gaylani's government for being the only part of the ruling class and a wealthy landowner, owning property in Berlin, while the rest were in the middle class. Al-Shabandar would later recount in his memoirs that a majority of Arabs at the time had sympathy towards Nazi Germany due to frustrations with imperialism and Zionism. The issues of various Arab states, as well as Nazi propaganda, played a big effect on Iraqis' sympathy. Al-Shabandar was a supporter of al-Gaylani but on 29 May, he would flee to Tehran along with many Iraqi officials after al-Gaylani's government fell.\nAl-Shabandar was later caught in Rhodesia and was sent back to Iraq to stand trail where he was sentenced to four years in prison in 1944. Al-Shabandar's sentence lasted until 1947, and in 1949, he would become a member of Nuri al-Said's Constitutional Union Party. Al-Said would also appoint al-Shabandar as the ambassador to Damascus during the presidency of Syrian military officer Husni al-Za'im in order to further develop Syrian-Iraqi relations.\nAl-Shabandar returned to occupy the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of Muhammad Fadhel al-Jamali for a short period from March 8, 1954, until April 29, 1954. He also held the same position for a longer period from August 3, 1954, until May 8, 1955, in the government of Nuri al-Said.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAl-Shabandar, Musa (1993).

        "content": "The Jewish Community of Worms (קהילה קדושה ווירמייזא, the \"Holy Community of Worms\") was one of the oldest documented Jewish communities in the German-speaking region. Until its destruction by the Nazis, the Jewish community in Worms had continuously existed since the Middle Ages, with only relatively short interruptions. Due to this long tradition, it always held a prominent position in the memory culture of Ashkenazic Judaism.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nIn the late antiquity, there were Jewish communities along the Rhine. However, their continuity into the High Middle Ages is not verifiable. In the self-presentation of the community, legendary founding stories circulated, which traced the existence of the community back to the time of the first destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.\nFrom the 9th century onwards, Jewish merchants from Italy and France migrated to the area that would later become Germany. The territory was to be developed according to the aspirations of the kings. The immigrant merchants from more advanced and urbanized areas were part of this innovation push. However, due to the scarce sources, it is not certain when local communities formed in the cities along the Rhine. This lack of historical facts was already perceived as a gap in the late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Period and was filled by a series of founding legends.\nThe two oldest written records that Jews lived in Worms are dated to the years 960 and 980. The oldest evidence of the existence of a Jewish community is the construction inscription for the Synagogue of Worms from the year 1034. It is also the oldest surviving construction inscription of a synagogue north of the Alps. The oldest tombstone in the Jewish cemetery in Worms (\"Holy Sand\") dates back to the year 1058/59.\nEmperor Henry IV granted a tax exemption to the Jews and the other inhabitants of Worms on 18 January 1074.\nThis is the oldest mention of Jews in Worms in a source from the surrounding majority society. In 1112, Henry V confirmed the charter. In the first half of the 1090s, he granted the Jews and the other citizens of Worms another extensive privilege. The charter guaranteed a comprehensive regulation of the legal relations of the Jewish community towards the Christian majority, an exclusion of the bishop from sovereignty rights over the Jews, and high barriers against conversion. The original of the charter has not been preserved, but there are a number of later confirmations. In one from Emperor Frederick I dated 6 April 1157, it is stated that the original to be confirmed was issued \"in the time of Salman, bishop of the same Jews.\" This is the oldest preserved mention of the Jewish bishop of Worms, an office that was the top function of the political Jewish community until the end of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\n=== Flowering period ===\n\nSince the 12th century, the Worms community, together with those in Mainz and Speyer, formed the ShUM federation, an acronym derived from the initial letters of the three cities.  These communities adopted a German rite in liturgy very early on, differing from the traditionally Italian-influenced one. All of this was documented early in prayer books and custom. Music also played an outstanding role. Auch Musik spielte eine hervorragende Rolle. From the 13th century onwards, the three communities also formed a federation in the interpretation and application of legal texts. The central document of this federation is the legal collection Taqqanot Qehillot Šum.\nAlso emerging in Worms since the 12th century was the movement of the Chasside Ashkenaz (\"the Pious of Ashkenaz\"), whose religious practice was characterized by strict notions of purity, impurity, and penance practices. The Kalonymides family, originally from Mainz, played a central role here.\nDue to its relative size, long continuity, and the fact that opponents of the Worms community only succeeded in temporarily expelling it from the city until 1938, it owed its long tradition. From this arose a series of its own customs and prayer orders deviating from those of other communities.  In the women's synagogue, there were prayer leaders who conducted the service as long as it was physically separated from the men's synagogue by a wall.\nThe Worms community was one of the largest in Germany. In the Reich tax register of 1241, it paid the second highest amount after the Strasbourg community. Over the course of the 14th century, the proceeds from this tax were increasingly assigned to various debtors of the German kings.\n\n\n=== Protection relations ===\nIn 1236, the charter of 1090, the Worms Privilege, was extended to Jews throughout the empire. The interesting formulation \"judei et coeteri Wormatienses\" (Jews and other Worms residents) is found in the toll privilege of 1074. This shows two things: firstly, Jews and Christians are addressed on the same level by the later emperor, thus not treated as legally inferior. Secondly, Christians are only referred to as \"other Worms residents,\" indicating that the toll privilege was primarily of interest to Jewish merchants, meaning that long-distance trade was in their hands.\nHowever, the legal status of the Jewish community gradually deteriorated. Contrary to the charter of 1090, the bishop did manage to gain significant rights over the Jews as the city lord of Worms. Various kings attempted to impose additional taxes on them or deny them legal protection against debtors. To varying degrees, the city of Worms sought to support the Jewish community in defending against such attacks. Conversely, there were also political constellations in which the king protected the Jewish community from attacks by the city of Worms. The Worms community, along with Frankfurt am Main as one of the few larger communities, successfully resisted the city's attempts to expel it. Furthermore, the family of the chamberlains of Worms and, until the end of the Holy Roman Empire, their branch of the Dalberg family provided protection to Jews in Worms.\n\n\n=== Internal organization ===\nThe Jewish community was administered by a council of 12 members (\"Parnassim\"), who co-opted members.  The council is said to have originated in the 11th century. From among its members, a community leader was chosen, \"the Jewish bishop of Worms\".  Elections had to be confirmed by the Christian bishop. The Jewish council existed until the transition of the imperial city of Worms to France following the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century. In the city of Worms, there were thus effectively two self-administrations side by side, with the Christian population already numerically predominant. In 1312, an agreement was reached between the Jewish community on the one hand, and the bishop and cathedral chapter on the other, which enshrined the constitution of the Jewish community with the twelve-member Jewish council at the top. Disputes among Jews were settled before the Jewish council, where only Jewish law applied. However, in disputes between members of both groups, the city court of the Christian majority population was responsible.\nJews could acquire citizenship, which meant full tax and military obligations, but not the right to vote. For example, in 1201, Jews participated in defending the city during a siege. The rules governing admission to citizenship were very similar for Jews and Christians. In practice, the Jewish council was almost exclusively responsible for admitting a Jewish citizen. Like Christians, Jews could only hold offices within their own group. Until the development of the ghetto in Judengasse in the middle of the 14th century, Jews could acquire property and reside throughout the city area.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages and modern times ===\nIn the course of the 14th century, the revenue from the tax that the Jewish community paid to the German king was increasingly transferred by the kings to various debtors. A low point of this development was the sale of rights on 4 January 1348 by King Charles IV to the city of Worms. The later emperor left to the city of Worms all Jews living there \"with their bodies and goods and with all benefits and rights\" that had previously belonged to him.\nHowever, the city did not fulfill its duty of protection. A year later, in 1349, about 400 Jews were murdered in the Plague Pogrom. Under pressure from third parties economically damaged by this, especially Elector Palatine Rupert I, the city had to readmit Jews within its walls in 1353. The ghetto dates from this time, shortly thereafter its physical separation from the rest of the city by gates. The triangular relationship between the emperor, bishop and the city of Worms, and the associated competitive situation between the three powers on the one hand and the Jewish community on the other, meant that the Jewish community – alongside that in Frankfurt am Main – was one of the few larger communities in the southern German cities that was never permanently displaced from the city. Emperor Ferdinand I did grant the city of Worms permission to expel the Jews on 17 December 1558. However, this was thwarted by the bishop. Conversely, there were also political constellations in which the king protected the Jewish community from attacks by the city of Worms. In various situations, the city of Worms tried to protect the Jewish community from external attacks.\n\n\n=== Internal organization ===\n\nSince at least 1348, the Jews had only the status of subjects of the city of Worms. Since the late Middle Ages, Jews were theoretically only allowed to stay in Worms for a limited time (\"Gedinge\"); they had to buy the right again every four years. However, when the city tried to expel the Jews in 1487, Emperor Frederick III intervened and prohibited it.\nIn 1521, Emperor Charles V appointed the Worms Rabbi Samuel ben Eliese Seezum as the supreme rabbi in the German Empire with his seat in Worms, and the same happened on 26 June 1559  under Emperor Ferdinand I with Rabbi Jakob zu Worms.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, the city was forced to quarter large numbers of troops, which ruined it economically. It therefore also tried to extort from the Jewish community, which also suffered terribly from the war. In 1641, a new municipal Jewish ordinance was confirmed by the emperor, which for the first time obliged all Jews to wear a yellow cloth ring sewn onto their clothing.  After the Thirty Years' War, attacks by the city on the Jewish community decreased in intensity; they were now less life-threatening and were primarily directed against Jewish property. This ended only with the takeover of power on the left bank of the Rhine by France in 1792.\n\n\n=== Persecutions ===\nWhile in the High Middle Ages Jews were able to acquire properties and live throughout the city area, ghettoization set in after the Plague Pogrom. From Plague Pogrom until the French era in 1792, Jews lived exclusively in the Judengasse and Hintere Judengasse neighborhoods. However, the legal status of the Jewish community deteriorated, as did the legal status of individuals. Various kings tried to impose additional taxes on the Jewish community or to deny Jewish creditors legal protection against debtors. Jews were restricted in their professional activities in order to prevent competition with Christian artisans.\n\nBut already since the High Middle Ages, the Worms community also suffered under much more massive threats and pogroms:\n\nThe First Crusade of 1096 is the first known in Worms. On 18 and 20 May 1096, persecuters murdered all Jews who had not already fled in their houses, unless they agreed to be baptized. There are said to have been between 400 and 800 who died.\nIn 1146, in the run-up to the Second Crusade, there was renewed violence against Jews along the Rhine. The central figure was Radulf the Cistercian. The Jewish community fled from Worms.\nAt the beginning of 1188, the Jewish community again fled the city due to an impending pogrom.\nOn 15 November 1196, the wife and children of the Worms Rabbi Eleazar of Worms were murdered by Crusaders.\nIn 1278, the old Jewish cemetery was threatened with destruction, which the Jewish community could only avert by paying 400 pounds of hellers.\n1349 Plague Pogrom.\nOn 10 April 1615, Easter Monday, expulsion of the Jewish community from Worms, destruction of the synagogue, damage to the old Jewish cemetery. The Jewish residents could not return until January 1616 under the protection of Palatine military.\nThe destruction of Worms by the French on 31 May 1689. The community had to leave the city, their buildings were again severely damaged, and it was not until 1699 that they could return to the city. In a collection book for rebuilding in 1698, the donating Grünstadt Jewish community was first mentioned in documents in this context.\nDuring Kristallnacht in November 1938, the synagogue was severely damaged. Many original parts could be preserved in the rubble. The Levy Synagogue was further damaged by air raids on Worms during World War II.\nIn the Holocaust, the community was annihilated. Over 400 Worms residents were deported and murdered. The deportation of those who had not been able to flee beforehand took place in several \"actions\", on 20 March 1942, from 24 to 27 September 1942 on 30 September 1942, in 1944 against \"Jewish\" partners from \"mixed marriages\" and on 24 March 1945 Rosa Bertram and Erich Salomon from Worms were murdered in a shooting by the Gestapo. In addition, many who had initially been able to flee abroad were murdered, but were then caught by the German occupiers and thus again exposed to the murderous grip of Nazi policy.\nThe stories collected by Juspa Schammes reflect the experience of the Worms community up to the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Emancipation ===\n\nIn times when persecution was not prevalent, the community absorbed numerous cultural influences from its environment. The ShUM communities adapted their marriage laws, for example, by abandoning polygamy, or the importance attached to martyrs.\nIn the 17th century, in individual cases, children from the Jewish community attended the municipal school. However, the religious differences were still so divisive that in 1789 the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the city's destruction by French military forces was strictly separated, with each group - Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Reformers and Jews - holding their own event.\nWith the dissolution of the structures of the Holy Roman Empire, the Judrat (Jewish council) was replaced by a community council. This advocated for full emancipation, which could be achieved in 1847/48, more than 40 years after it had already happened under French sovereignty, but years earlier than in many other German states. From the 1830s onwards, Jews increasingly took up residence and established businesses outside of the ghetto. Around 1800 there were about 500 Jews living in the city, around 1850 about 1,000, which was largely the result of immigration from the countryside.\nIn 1849, the Hessian government appointed Ferdinand Eberstadt as the first Jewish mayor in Germany. He served until 1852.\nIn the 1840s, the community split over questions of modernization and adaptation to the rapidly changing culture outside the community into an Orthodox and a more liberal direction. This found architectural expression, among other things, in the removal of the dividing wall between the women's and men's synagogues and the installation of an organ. The Orthodox part of the community then separated and in 1871 erected its own synagogue (New Synagogue/Levy Synagogue) directly opposite the medieval synagogue.\n\n\n=== Social circumstances ===\nAround 1500, the Judengasse was still not fully built up. Numerous vacant lots and interspersed gardens characterized the townscape. At the end of the 17th century, however, shortly before the city's destruction in the War of the Palatine Succession in 1689, the Judengasse was densely built up, without any gaps in the street fronts. This dense development had not yet been reached again by 1760. Particularly in the area of the Hintere Judengasse there were numerous undeveloped plots and gardens.\n\n\n=== Population development ===\n\n\n== Institutions ==\nThe institution that made the Worms community famous far beyond its regional area was the yeshiva there in the High Middle Ages. Numerous theologians who were trained there assumed leading roles in communities of Northern Europe.\nThe community had all the institutions required for community life: synagogue, mikveh, community house and a community building (on the site of today's Rashi House). Around this core, the ghetto had formed by the late Middle Ages. It consisted of the streets Judengasse and Hintere Judengasse and was secured by gates where these streets led into the surrounding town. The obligation for Jews to live in the ghetto was only lifted in the period after 1792, when Worms belonged to France.\nIn 1924, a Jewish Museum was opened on the first floor of the annex to the women's synagogue.  The driving force was Isidor Kiefer, who had set it up and managed it. Most of the museum's objects were lost in Kristallnacht.\n\n\n== Present day ==\n\nSince the Holocaust, there has not been a Jewish community in Worms. The city archivist Friedrich Maria Illert succeeded in rescuing part of the community's cultural assets from destruction. These included the community's archives, medieval manuscripts and early printed works, as well as architectural elements from the medieval synagogue and its annexes. The Jewish part of the Hochheimer Höhe cemetery with its own mourning hall were also preserved. The two synagogues were severely damaged. After World War II, the ruin of the New Synagogue was demolished in 1947, while the old synagogue was reconstructed from 1958 to 1961 on the foundations of the historical building – using recovered architectural elements.\nDue to a state law, the legal successor to the former Jewish Community of Worms was the Jewish Community of Mainz, then the only existing one in Rhineland-Palatinate. Initially, however, both the city of Worms and the Jewish Trust Corporation for Germany - Branche Francais also asserted claims to the preservation of the archives or the Worms Mahzor. This led to a settlement, the result of which was ultimately that one part (the community archives and the Worms Mahzor) was handed over to Israel, while another part became the property of the Jewish Community of Mainz but remains on deposit in the Worms City Archives. The synagogue, mikveh, Rashi Yeshiva and synagogue garden, as well as the old Jewish cemetery, are owned by the Jewish Community of Mainz.\nThe Jewish Community of Mainz, Worms and Rheinhessen is a public corporation. It is a unified community and sees itself as an Orthodox community. It acts on the basis of bylaws adopted by the general assembly. All community members can participate in the general assembly. Every two years, the volunteer board is elected by secret ballot. It determines the guidelines for community policy, conducts day-to-day business, and represents the community externally.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFriedrich Battenberg, Die reichsritterschaftliche Herrschaft Dalberg und die Juden, in Kurt Andermann (editor): Ritteradel im Alten Reich.

        "content": "Caritas Asia is a pan-Asian nonprofit organisation and one of the seven regions of the global Caritas Internationalis confederation. Caritas Asia refers both to its regional secretariat, based in Bangkok and its network with 25 member organisation.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCaritas Asia's predecessor was the Asia Partnership for Human Development, founded in 1973 and bringing together more than 23 Catholic development organisations from Asia and the West.\nThe current structure was established in 1999 during the general assembly of Caritas Internationalis in Rome, where the request of its Asian member organisation to create a regional secretariat was approved. The goal of Caritas Asia is to coordinate the work of its member organisations, especially in the context of responses to natural disaster, as well as to strengthen the technical capacities of the network.\n\n\n== Membership ==\nCaritas Asia consists of 25 national member organisations operating in 24 Asian countries. In Singapore, there are two member organisations: Caritas Singapore and Caritas Humanitarian Aid & Relief Initiatives (CHARIS). Not all Asian national Caritas organisations are members of Caritas Asia; those in the Middle East, despite being geographically located in Asia, such as Caritas Jordan, Caritas Iraq and Caritas Iran, are members of Caritas Middle East and North Africa, while Caritas of Armenia, Georgia, Russia and Turkey are part of Caritas Europa.\nThe membership of Caritas Asia is further grouped under four subregions, each having their own sub-regional office. These are Central Asia with an office in Kyrgyzstan, East Asia with an office in Macau, South Asia with an office in Sri Lanka and South-East Asia with an office in Singapore.\n\n\n=== List of Member Organisations ===\n\n\n== Leadership ==\n\n\n=== Presidents ===\n...\n2007-2011: Joseph Vianney Fernando\n2011-2019: Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi\n2019-2023: Benedict Alo D'Rozario\n\n\n=== Regional Coordinators ===\n...\n2008-2012: Fr.

        "content": "The succession war after the death of Sidi Rasul Yakut in February 1733 ignited a complex and protracted conflict for control over his kingdom, marked by intrigue, shifting alliances, and external interventions. Abdulla, the rightful heir, found himself challenged by his own kin, including his son Sidi Rahman, amidst the ambitions of rebellious governors like Shaikh Yakub Khan.

Abdulla, the rightful heir, found himself challenged by his own kin, including his son Sidi Rahman, amidst the ambitions of rebellious governors like Shaikh Yakub Khan. The situation escalated with the involvement of the Marathas, led by Baji Rao and later joined by the Pratinidhi, in a campaign against the Sidis. Despite initial successes, including the conquest of key fortresses, the conflict endured due to the resilience of Janjira fortress and external support sought by the Sidis from European powers and regional rulers.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe death of Sidi Rasul Yakut in February 1733 triggered a civil war for succession in his kingdom. His son Abdulla, the rightful heir, faced challenges from his brothers and even his own son Sidi Rahman. The situation worsened with the rebellious governors, particularly Shaikh Yakub Khan, who was ambitious and had a Hindu convert background. Intrigues by Prabhu Sardar Yashwant Rao  further fueled the internal conflict, leading to Sidi Rahman and Shaikh Yakub Khan aligning with the Marathas. Baji Rao was tasked by Shahu to lead the expedition against the Sidis, with FattehSingh Bhosale joining later.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\nBaji Rao seized the fortresses of Tala and Ghosala in the Konkan, then clashed with Saikhoji Angre at Dandrajpuri. Siddi Abdulla was killed at Janjira, prompting a siege. Despite efforts by Baji Rao and Manaji Angre, the fortress held, with the Siddi seeking help from the Portuguese, English, Mughals, and Nizam. Marathas raided various places, but outside aid was limited. The Portuguese sent ships under the guise of mediation, the Mughals urged English assistance, but focused on trade. Ultimately, the siege ended without resolution\nThe Pratinidhi, led by Anand Rao Sarlaskar and Krishnaji Dabhade, joined Baji Rao's campaign on May 20. However, Baji Rao's enthusiasm waned upon their arrival. Despite this, the Pratinidhi's clever intrigues led to the conquest of Raigad on June 8, 1733. Bankaji Naik further strengthened the Maratha cause by capturing Bankot and Mandangad fortresses, then defeating the Sidi at Goalkot on July 8. Although the Sidi fled to the fortress, they did not surrender.\nBy July, most of the Sidi's dominions had fallen to the Marathas, alarming the English who had suffered from Angre's actions. They sent a battleship to aid the Sidi against Angre's siege on Underi island, but failed. In September, another squadron was dispatched, coinciding with Saikhoji Angre's death, leading to internal conflicts among the Marathas. Shahu refrained from appointing a single Commander-in-Chief, causing a loss of command at sea to the Sidi and the English, who formed an alliance. The Nizam supported the Sidi, prompting Chimnaji Appa to stay in Poona. Additionally, conflicts between Maratha factions and indifference from allies led to a decline in Maratha activities. Despite attempts to take Janjira, quarrels between the Angre brothers appeared to be failure of the Konkan campaign.\nIn December 1733, realizing the challenges including loss of sea control and lack of cooperation, BajiRao sought an honorable peace, recognizing Abdul Rahman as chief of Janjira. Despite this, tensions persisted, leading to ongoing conflict. Efforts to remove Sidi Sat from Anjanwel and Goalkot were hindered by quarrels and lack of siege equipment. In 1736, Shahu dispatched Chimnaji Appa to halt Sidi Sat's aggression. A decisive battle ensued on April 19, resulting in Sidi Sat's defeat and death, along with Sidi Yakub, the fort commandant.\n\n\n== Result ==\nIn 1736, the Marathas secured victory at a high cost, leading to the death of Siddi Sat and easing Brahmendra Swami and Shahu's concerns. Siddi Rahmakh of Janjira proposed peace terms, ending the war on the condition of friendship with the Peshwa. Despite retaining control of Anjanwel and Goalkot, the Siddi's power declined, confirming the Peshwa's supremacy in the Konkan. The Peshwa's dominance was further solidified due to internal conflicts within the Angre family, which weakened their position. Baji Rao seized the opportunity to intervene in the Angre quarrel, dividing authority and possessions between Sambhaji and Manaji Angre, ultimately diminishing the Angre's strength and resources.\n\n\n== Maratha Portuguese relations after and during the Campaign ==\n\n\n=== First Phase ===\nBy 1736, Baji Rao had significantly weakened the Sidi and Angre powers, leaving only the Portuguese as a concern. The Portuguese had intervened in domestic disputes among the Angre brothers, aggravating tensions with the Marathas. Their power, established in India since 1498, had declined by the late 17th century, coinciding with the Marathas' ascent. The Portuguese had alienated their Hindu subjects through forcible conversions, destruction of temples, and other oppressive measures. Seeking refuge in Maharashtra, some Hindus, like the Pathare Prabhus, aimed to overthrow Portuguese rule. Gangaji Naik sought support from Sambhaji, Kanhoji Angre, and Khanderao Dabhade without success. In 1720, Baji Rao's influence in Kalyan prompted efforts to engage the Portuguese. Antaji Raghunath and Ramchandra Raghunath of Malad urged Baji Rao for action. Baji Rao, recognizing his growing power, sent Pilaji Jadhav and reinforcements against the Portuguese in 1731, achieving significant victories.\n\n\n=== Second Phase ===\nThe passage describes the strategic movements and battles during the Maratha campaign against Portuguese strongholds in the Konkan region in 1737. Beginning with the gathering of Maratha forces under Baji Rao's command, it details their surprise attacks and captures of forts such as Thana, Salsette, Dharavi, and Arnala. Despite initial successes, delays due to the rainy season and Baji Rao's departure led to a temporary halt in the campaign. However, reconnaissance efforts continued, leading to eventual resumed attacks on Bassein in the following cold weather season.\n\n\n=== Fall of Vasai ===\nDuring the siege of Baçaim in May 1739, Maratha forces, led by Chimaji Appa, breached the walls near the towers of São Sebastião and Nossa Senhora dos Remedios. Despite fierce Portuguese opposition, the Marathas eventually succeeded, demolishing the tower of São Sebastião and compelling the surrender of the fort on May 16. The remaining garrison left with honors on May 23, with the saffron flag raised over Baçaim.\n\n\n== Maratha English Relations After Campaign ==\nIn May 1739, the English, alarmed by the Portuguese's downfall, dispatched two embassies: one to the Peshwa and the other to Shahu. Captain Inchbird's mission to the Peshwa failed, while Captain Gordon succeeded with Shahu, securing an alliance due to Nadir Shah's impending invasion of Maharashtra. Shahu, relieved by Nadir Shah's departure and the Portuguese's defeat, warmly welcomed the English envoy, prompting an alliance granting free trade throughout the Peshwa's domains. By June 1739, the Peshwa's authority extended over the North and the Konkan.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nDuring the fallout with the Sidi, Sambhaji aimed to weaken the Angres by fueling their conflicts. Exploiting their discord, he instigated a clash in 1734, attempting to seize Anjanwel from Sidi Sat. Manaji, eager for power, betrayed Sambhaji, aligning with the Portuguese against him. Sambhaji's subsequent retaliation was initially repelled, but when Manaji failed to honor his agreement with the Portuguese, they withdrew support, allowing Sambhaji to reclaim Kolaba. Manaji, realizing his mistake, sought aid from the Peshwa, offering territory in exchange. The Peshwa intervened, granting Kolaba to Manaji and Suvarnadurg to Sambhaji, seeking to balance power between them.\nSambhaji and his ally, the Pratinidhi, opposed the division of power and possessions of Anges, despite Shahu's approval. Baji Rao's actions in the Konkan in 1736 led to conflict with Sambhaji and sparked a war with the Portuguese. Even after the Portuguese defeat in 1739, internal strife persisted, ultimately leading to the downfall of the Angre family. This decline, starting in 1735, culminated in their complete destruction in 1755\n\n\n== Reference ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Thomas Douglas Hamilton Garside (1855–1927) was a Scottish mathematics professor and trade union leader. The son of a Scottish railroad contractor, he became an evangelical preacher in Northern Ireland, before moving to the United States. In Philadelphia, he joined the socialist movement and became an organiser for the Knights of Labor. By 1889, he had gravitated towards anarchism and was expelled from the Socialist Labor Party of America. The following year, he led a cloakmakers' strike in New York City, along with Emma Goldman and Joseph Barondess. After the strike achieved its goals, he returned to Philadelphia, where he allegedly became a United States Marshal. By 1893, he had returned to Britain, where he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and organised for tenants' rights. During World War I, he joined the Liberal Party, within which he agitated for welfare and pensions for veterans. He died in London in 1927.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nThomas Douglas Hamilton Garside was born in Lancashire, in 1855, the son of a Scottish railroad contractor. He was educated at Stockholm University and remained in the city after graduation, teaching mathematics at a secondary school. He then followed his father's wishes that he become a preacher and moved to Northern Ireland, where he preached the gospel for seven years.\n\n\n=== Socialist activism in the United States ===\nIn 1881, he immigrated to the United States, initially settling in Baltimore before moving to Philadelphia, where he worked as a tutor for aspiring college students. Before long, the former evangelical preacher had become a socialist. He soon quit his tutoring job and moved into trade union organising, joining the Socialist Labor Party (SLP) and the Knights of Labor.\nOn 8 May 1884, Garside married Emma Mary Goldman,, the daughter of a well-off farmer from Berks County, Pennsylvania. In 1888, he had an affair with the anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre. In a poem about Garside, de Cleyre wrote lovingly of his \"tender mouth and Christ-like eyes\", as well as his voice, which she described as \"sweet as the summer wind that sighs through the arbors of Paradise.\" Despite warnings from Dyer Lum, who told her that Garside was \"vain and self-indulgent\", de Cleyre fell deeply in love with him. According to historian Paul Avrich, \"for all his charm and glib phrasemaking,\" Garside turned out to be \"superficial, egotistical, and callous.\" After a few months of their affair, Garside abandoned de Cleyre, which left her feeling hurt and betrayed. She wrote several poems about her rejection, moved back into her family home in St. Johns, Michigan, where she lived in distress. She was cared for in the aftermath of the affair by Lum himself, who became a stabilising influence in her life.\nIn January 1889, Garside attended a Knights of Labor meeting in Chicago, where he was scheduled to give a lecture on behalf of the SLP. The meeting was chaired by Lizzie Holmes, who had invited the anarchist Lucy Parsons to speak at the meeting before Garside. After Parsons' 90 minute speech, Garside stood up to give his 30-minute lecture. Garside had himself been invited to the meeting by the SLP's leader Thomas J. Morgan, who hoped to have an ally against Parsons, but Garside instead aligned himself with the anarchists. While Garside himself expressed concerns about the anarchists' violent tactics, he also dismissed electoralism, and distinguished between codified law and natural law. Morgan quickly denounced Garside, declaring that at the meeting he had \"disgusted all the socialists while the anarchists roared with delight.\" Morgan's speech was interrupted by the audience when he mentioned Garside, who they applauded. Dismayed by his defeat at the meeting, Morgan had expelled Garside from the SLP.\n\n\n=== Leadership of the 1890 cloakmakers' strike ===\nIn 1889, Garside moved to New York City, where he joined the International Working People's Association (IWPA), spoke alongside Johann Most at its meetings and published a pamphlet that critiqued modern industrialisation, which sold 15,000 copies. By this time, Garside had become concerned with improving living and working conditions for the city's Jewish immigrants, organising mutual aid societies for their benefit. In 1890, Jewish workers in New York's cloakmaking industry had organised a mass strike movement, 3,000 workers strong, led by Joseph Barondess under the banner of the United Hebrew Trades. Seeking anarchist support for the strike, Barondess invited the Jewish anarchist Emma Goldman, as well as Garside himself, to help lead the strike action.\nWhen Goldman met Garside during the strike, she described him as \"tall, pale, and languid-looking. His manner was gentle and ingratiating, and he resembled somewhat the pictures of Christ.\" Goldman recalled that \"He was always trying to pacify conflicting elements, to smooth things over.\" An article about the strike in The Midland Journal described him as \"a man who impresses one with the idea that his store of nervous energy must be almost inexhaustible, and his frank manner and pleasant voice bind to him the confidence of his followers, and enable him to sway the passions of those toilers who have learned to believe him almost infallible. He is a tall, well built, rather handsome man, with curling brown hair, mustache and imperial. He wears a black slouch hat and dresses plainly.\" Chaim Leib Weinberg recalled Garside leading a parade on International Workers' Day of 1890, which was so large that the press began to panic, \"terrified that social revolution in America was imminent\".\nGarside secured strike pay for the cloakmakers, and gained the support from Jewish anarchists after he spoke in favour of \"propaganda of the deed\" and against electoralism. He was elected to represent the union, in negotiations for a settlement with their employers. But as the terms of the settlement did not include the dismissal of strikebreakers or the fixing of wages, the union rejected the settlement and continued the strike until their demands were met. The strike achieved its goals and ended in July 1890, after which Garside returned to Philadelphia.\nIn June 1891, the New York Times published a story alleging that Garside had become a deputy of the United States Marshals Service, although the story's accuracy wasn't verified. The anarchists' influence within the cloakmakers' union was greatly undermined by the scandal. Garside himself subsequently disappeared from American historical record.\n\n\n=== Return to Britain and later life ===\nBy 1893, Garside had returned to Britain and settled in Broughton, where he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and became involved in tenants rights struggles. He wrote about the exploitation of tenant-workers in Ancoats by the Manchester Corporation, and was involved in a litigation case against landlords by the Lancashire and Cheshire Society of Stallholders. At the second conference of the ILP in 1894, Garside represented the Women's National Assotiation of the ILP as a delegate from Manchester; he proposed that the ILP headquarters be moved to Manchester, which he pointed out had been the centre of the independent labour movement.\nDuring World War I, Garside and Liberal Party MP James Hogge became concerned with the welfare of veterans. In mid-January 1917, Garside and Hogge established the Naval and Military War Pensions and Welfare league, a national organisation created to push for military pensions after demobilisation. In 1918, Hogge and Garside published a report on the matter, in the book War Pensions and Allowances. Garside ran as the Liberal candidate in Ilford for the 1918 United Kingdom general election, but came last place with 13.7% of the vote, losing to the Conservative candidate Peter Griggs. After the war, he served as secretary of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers (NFDDSS).\nThomas Hamilton Garside died in the London borough of Chelsea, on 21 October 1927.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nA Critique of the Present Industrial System (1889)\nThe Horrors of Ancoats (1893) OCLC 80365117\nMr Nobody, of Nowhere, and Nan (1895, The Market Stree Press Works) OCLC 1056039856\nWar Pensions And Allowances (1918, Hodder and Stoughton) OCLC 3733305\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArchived articles about Garside - The New York Times",

        "content": "The Epitaphios Thrinos (Greek: Επιτάφιος Θρήνος, lit. 'Threnody on the Tomb') also known as Encomia Epitafiou (Εγκώμια Επιταφίου) is a Christian liturgical hymn sang on Holy Saturday in the Orthodox churches. Full of strong emotional feelings, it is one of \"the most beloved hymns of the Orthodox\".\nKnown in English as the \"Threnody at the Tomb\", its other Greek name, Encomia Epitafiou (Greek: Εγκώμια επιταφίου), \"Praises of the Tomb\", could assimilate it with a form of encomium or praise rather than lament.  The pagan encomium is the source of the Christian panegyric and the Epitaphios Thrinos was therefore a form of panegyric for Christ.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe early manuscripts for the liturgy of Holy Saturday do not seem to mention the Encomia. The first reference to encomia is found in manuscripts of the thirteenth century in connection with Psalm 118, known as the Amomos. Their number, however was undefined and it appears that the collection grew gradually to its present form resulting in many variations among the collections.\nThe repertoire of the Encomia lamentations first appeared as such in the 1522 edition of the  service book of the Orthodox Church Triodion, printed in Venice. Subsequent editions have relied heavily on this source.\nAccording to the Lenten Triodion as well as the 1906 edition of the Patriarchal Text, there are 185 verses in the Epitaphios Thrinos divided into three stasis or sections. However, the Triodion and the Patriarchal text do not concur as to the palce of the Epitaphios: in all the editions of the Triodion the Encomia appear before the Canon in the order of the Orthros of Great Saturday while the same Encomia appear after the Canon for the Patriarchal Text of Great Week.\n\n\n== Liturgy ==\n\nThe verses of these Lamentations are interspersed between the verses of Psalm 118 (the chanting of this psalm forms a major part of the Orthodox funeral service as well as being a usual part of Saturday Matins). The Lamentations are divided into three sections called stáses, which commemorate the Passion, Death and Entombment of Christ. Each statis is commonly known by its first phrase; in Greek these are:\n\nFirst stasis: Ἡ ζωὴ ἐν τάφῳ, He zoe en taphoi, \"Life in (the) tomb\" or \"Life in (the) grave\".\nSecond stasis: Ἄξιον ἐστί, Axion esti, \"Worthy, it is\" or \"It is Truly Meet\".\nThird stasis: Αἱ γενεαὶ πᾶσαι, Hai geneai pasai, \"All the generations\" or \"Every generation\".\nAt the beginning of each stasis, the priest or deacon performs a censing of the epitaphios. In the Greek tradition, at the third and final stasis, the priest will sprinkle rosewater on the epitaphios and the congregation, symbolising the anointing of Christ's body with spices.\nAll three of stasis end with the same eulogh they begin while the officiating priest or high priest incenses the epitaph on all four sides. \n\n\n== Lyrics ==\nWhile some musical settings have famous authors or interpreters, the author of the Encomia remains unknown. Famous hymnographers of the Holy Week hymns, including Andrew of Crete, Cosmas of Maiuma, John of Damascus, Theophanes the Confessor, Theodore the Studite, Joseph the Hymnographer, and Mark the Monk could be associated with the Encomia but no strong evidence for any of the above has been given to confirm their authorship. The lyrics of the Encomia would be particularly long to quote in full, but the emotions they convey can be seen from this short abstract of the third stasis on the entombment of Christ:\n\nThese lyrics served as models for the creation of similar ones for the Dormition of the Virgin, for Saint Nicholas and others.\n\n\n== Performance ==\nIn addition to the cantors of Byzantine music, the eulogies have been performed and recorded by various contemporary Greek and international artists, such as Maria Farantouri, Glykeria, Haris Alexiou, Petros Gaitanos, Fairuz and others.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAlexiou, Margaret (2002-04-03).

        "content": "Pierre de Chambly (c. 1260 – 18 January 1308), also known as Pierre the Fat (French: Pierre le Gras), Pierre VI de Chambly, or Pierre III de Chambly, was a French noble who served as chamberlain under King Philip IV of France. He was lord of Viarmes, Livry, Presles, Torigny, and (briefly) Tournan.\n\n\n== Life ==\nPierre was born around 1260, the son of Pierre the Hideous, lord of Chambly (seigneur de Chambly). In 1277, he married Jeanne de Machault, daughter of the chamberlain Pierre de Machault. Her dowry included 65 livres of rent and 33 arpents (about 16.9 hectares or 42 acres) at Chapendu which were sold for 150 livres (about 12 kg or 26 lb of fine silver) to St. Magloire in Paris in 1289.\nHis father successively provided him with the lordships of Presles (seigneur de Presles) and, in 1285, Livry (seigneur de Livry). By 1288, he was also lord of Viarmes. He purchased the lordship of Torigny (seigneur de Torigny) in Normandy from Queen Margaret of Naples for 9500 livres tournois (about 768 kg or 1,700 lb of fine silver). In May 1293, he purchased the lordship of Tournan (seigneur de Tournan) from Jean II de Garlande; he ceded it in October of the same year to Charles, count of Valois. In 1302, he gave King Philip IV special hunting privileges in the forests of Livry.\nDuring the Franco-Flemish War, he led a contingent of 6 knights and 26 squires in the 1297 campaign and fought again in 1302 after the French defeat at Courtrai. While serving as grand chamberlain for Philip IV, he participated in the negotiations over the 1303 Treaty of Paris finally ending the 1294–1303 Gascon War following the Battle of the Golden Spurs, allowing France to prosecute the rest of the Franco-Flemish War with greater success.\nHe died on 18 January 1308. His father died two years later in 1310 and his wife 23 years later in 1331. Their children were Pierre the Younger (Pierre le Jeune), who succeeded him to the lordship of Viarmes and Livry and who married Isabelle de Bourgogne; Philippe, who became lord of Livry and who married Jeanne de Trie; Jean, a knight; Pierre or Jean-Pierre, archdeacon of Thérouanne; Louis, archdeacon of Chartres; Marie; Louise, who married Robert d'Estouteville; Isabeau, who married Jean de Rouvray; Jeanne, lady of Montgobert, who married Robert de Clermont in 1312; and Marguerite, who married Gilles de Clary and lived until 1371.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "The Hermano Pedro's Way (also known as the Ruta del Hermano Pedro or the Ruta del Camino del Hermano Pedro) is an ancient pilgrimage route, linked to the figure of Saint Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur (better known as Santo Hermano Pedro), who is the first Saint of the Canary Islands. It runs approximately 19 kilometers between the municipalities of Vilaflor, San Miguel de Abona and Granadilla de Abona, in the southeast of the island of Tenerife (Spain).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Hermano Pedro's Way is, in its origin, a transhumance route used by the Guanche aborigines to direct their livestock from coast to summit, depending on the season of the year. After the conquest of the island in the 15th century, it continued to be framed by a set of traditional paths, appearing on historical maps of the 18th and 19th centuries. This route was also used in the 17th century by Saint Peter of Betancur during his childhood and adolescence, when he worked as a goat shepherd, before carrying out his missionary and apostolic work in Guatemala.\n\n\n== The route ==\nIn 2005, following the canonization of the saint three years earlier, a study began with the purpose of recovering, revaluing and institutionalizing the path of Hermano Pedro and its adjacent paths. In addition to highlighting it as a symbol of union of the municipalities of the Abona or Chasna region (Fasnia, Arico, Granadilla de Abona, San Miguel de Abona and Vilaflor).\nThe official pilgrimage takes place annually on the Saturday closest to April 24 (the saint's holiday).\n\nFirst, a Eucharist takes place at 6:00 in the morning in the main parish of Saint Peter the Apostle in the town of Vilaflor, the saint's hometown. At 7:00 the downhill or descent route begins, crossing part of the municipality of San Miguel de Abona until reaching the popularly known as cave of Santo Hermano Pedro in the municipality of Granadilla de Abona. This place was used by Hermano Pedro as a shelter or refuge with his flock in winter, as a place of prayer and even as a hiding place to protect himself from pirate raids.\nThe trail route lasts approximately five hours. The route is dotted with important samples of natural and cultural heritage; fauna of great interest that can be observed along the route; and other elements. In addition to important architectural elements and Bien de Interés Cultural (BIC).\nArrival at the cave is estimated at 1:00 p.m., where another Eucharist and the veneration of a relic of the saint takes place.\nIn addition to the promoters and organizers of the route: the municipalities of Vilaflor and Granadilla, other entities and volunteers from the religious space of the cave of Santo Hermano Pedro collaborate. In 2012 this route was promoted in the Network of Religious Routes in Europe with the aim of joining it.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPilgrimage to Candelaria\nOld road of Candelaria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nXVII Ruta del Camino del Hermano Pedro 2024.

        "content": "William Colgate Eaton (February 4, 1851 – June 1, 1936) was a commodore in the United States Navy and professor of engineering at Madison University (now Colgate University). He was also a noted numismatist and Freemason.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nEaton was the son of George Washington Eaton and Eliza H. (Boardman) Eaton. His father was the president of Madison University 1856–1868 and of the seminary 1861–1871. Eaton's middle name came from his father's friendship with the Colgate family.\nEaton graduated from Madison with an A.B. in 1869, an A.M. in 1872, and a Ph.D. in 1881. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1874. He served in various capacities as a naval officer, chiefly in the Department of Engineering. Eaton was appointed head of the engineering department at Madison University in 1888–1890. From 1891 to 1894 he served in the Asiatic Squadron. In 1892 he was appointed by Li Hongzhang as examiner of naval engineering graduates at Imperial Tientsin University, China. He then served as fleet engineer of the Pacific Squadron 1899–1900. During the Spanish–American War he was chief engineer on the USS Amphitrite, which participated in the bombardment of San Juan. After the war he was commissioned chief engineer. He retired at his own request as commodore in 1908. During World War I, Eaton was recalled to service as Inspector of Engineering Material and Ordnance in Cincinnati.\nHe married Lizzie Blish in 1890 and they had one son.\n\n\n== Freemasonry ==\nEaton was a Freemason and a Shriner and was one of the founders of the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm, an appendant body of Freemasonry.\n\n\n== Numismatics ==\nEaton was a member of the American Numismatic Association and was a collector of Civil War tokens. He drilled two holes in each cent so that he could string them together in a seven-foot chain. Eaton was \"one of the pioneers of Lincoln Cent collecting, and perhaps the only person to take this activity seriously within the numismatic community at the time\". He contributed articles to The Numismatist.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Moulin de Macaire  is a french hydraulic-powered mill located in the Brittany region, in the department of Ille-et-Vilaine, in the commune of Pléchâtel at a place called Macaire.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe two primary mills of Macaire have origins dating back to March 10, 1418, and July 26, 1542, respectively. An authentic document testifies to the reconstruction of these mills in 1645. On August 13, 1828, a royal decree authorized the transformation of the mill into a flour mill. On August 17, 1835, Pierre Richard de La Pervanchère, owner of the mill and all of Plessis-Bardoult, decided to demolish the old Macaire mills, moving them to the left bank where they still exist today, due to their negative impact on the reconstruction of the lock and spillway.\nInitially, these old mills had the shape of a spur upstream. A royal order of September 7, 1840 regulates and authorizes the reconstruction of the mills on the site of an old fulling mill, at the end of the new dam to be built. This reconstruction was completed in 1841. In 1844, the mills were put out of work due to navigation works on the Vilaine.\nIn 1852, the flour mill had four pairs of millstones, increasing to twelve roller mills in 1898. In 1899, a Sagebien type water wheel was mentioned. In 1862, the Macaire flour mill employed ten people.\nIn 1877, a metal footbridge linking the flour mill to the Macaire lock was erected, overlooking the spillway for 40 meters. This footbridge replaces the passing boat upstream of the dam, removed by prefectural decree of March 11, 1875. On June 2, 1888, Fidèle Simon, owner of the flour mill, was ordered to remove the footbridge, responsible for an accident which occurred on December 31, 1879, causing damage to the Macaire dam.\nIn 1913, the flour mill combined hydraulic power and steam, still retaining a hydraulic turbine in place. The mill reaches a daily output of 200 quintals.\nIn 1932, the mill went bankrupt. Pursued by creditors, for a debt of 5 million francs, the owner is placed under arrest warrant.\n\n\n== Location ==\n47°51′59″N 1°46′35″W\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Moulin de Macaire ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Lock of Macaire ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== External links ===\n\"Inventory of the industrial heritage of Ille-et-Vilaine (Conseil général d'Ille-et-Vilaine - Patrimoine)\".",

        "content": "Kuusa, also known as Kuusaa, is a village in Laukaa, Finland, located 6 km (3.7 mi) north of the municipal administrative center. The village is centered around the Kuusaankoski rapids between the lakes Vatianjärvi and Saraavesi and the Kuusa lock of the Keitele Canal.\nThe population of Kuusa was approximately 450 in 2013, making it one of the largest villages within the municipality. There are also a few dozen summer residences in the village.\nKuusa was not an official register village (rekisterikylä), the settlement is located on the borders of five official villages: Pellosniemi (the administrative center of Laukaa), Laukkavirta, Haapavatia, Petruma and Kuusvesi.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\nKuusa is named after the Kuusaankoski rapids, first mentioned in 1504 as part of the toponym Kwsankoskonsarj (modern spelling Kuusa(a)nkoskensaari), referring to some island near the rapids. The initial element is most likely derived from the dialectal word kuusas referring to a small spruce, as the trees are common in the area. Both forms of the village name, Kuusa and Kuusaa, are used by locals; Kuusaa is the older form, while Kuusa is more common today.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAside from Saraavesi and Vatianjärvi, there are multiple smaller lakes or ponds in the village, such as Asemalampi, Vähänharjunlampi, Pörrinlampi and Oitinlampi. The most prominent natural features in the village are the Kuusaankoski rapids as well as the hill Oitinmäki, which is part of a terminal moraine formation. Its peak reaches an elevation of 172 m from sea level.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe development of Kuusa began in the 18th century, when new farms were established near the rapids on the lands of the nearby older villages. \n\nThe first farms in the area were Saarikko and Itälahti, officially part of Haapavatia, which were formed in 1780 as the 16th-century Peura farm was split into four parts. Saarikko was divided into Ylä-Saarikko and Ala-Saarikko in 1841, while Rantala was separated from Itälahti in 1843.\nThe first farms on the lands of Laukkavirta were Keskinen and Karhila, later known as Kuusanmäki and Hietala, which were separated from the Pellinen farm in 1823.\nThe village of Pellosniemi, at the time mostly lands of the vicarage of Laukaa, had a tenure farm (torppa) called Mikkola, which was relocated further away from the vicarage and closer to the Kuusaankoski in the 1890s, acquiring the new name Koskela soon after.\nOn Petruma's part of the area, the first farm was Varjola, separated from the Finni farm in 1872, while the oldest farm in Kuusvesi's part of Kuusa is Kattala.\nLog driving in Laukaa began in the 1830s as the importance of the sawmill industry had begun to grow. Wood was transported through the Kuusaankoski especially to the sawmill at Vaajakoski. In 1838, engineer captain Karl Robert Westling requested permission to establish a sawmill in the Kuusaankoski, however this sawmill was never established due to disagreements over ownership of nearby forests. Despite this, Kuusa kept developing, with the village's modern center forming in the 1870s. \nSince the 1880s, there had been plans to connect the Päijänne and Keitele, either by a canal or a railroad. In 1890, it was decided that a railroad was to be built between Jyväskylä and Suolahti, which would also pass through Kuusa. The Jyväskylä–Suolahti railroad was finished in 1898 and a station was opened in Kuusa. The railroad also allowed a post office and three stores to operate in the village. In 1924, a power plant was established in the Kuusaankoski, which provided electricity for the station and to the villages of Petruma and Haapavatia. Passenger traffic at the station continued until the 1980s.\nThe construction of the Keitele–Päijänne canal, including a lock in Kuusa, began in 1990 to balance Finnish–Soviet trade. Approximately 600 Russian workers were temporarily settled in and around the former Torikka school in nearby Vatia. The canal was finished and officially opened by President Martti Ahtisaari in 1994.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere is a primary school for grades 1–6 in Kuusa. The school was established on lands bought from the Yläsaarikko farm in 1910 after the older Haapavatia school district was divided into two parts (the other being Valkola). Initially providing education only for the upper grades of kansakoulu (the contemporary elementary school system), it was expanded to include lower grades in 1940. By the 1950s, the main building had become decrepit and was replaced with a new building in 1957. The school was officially reformed into a modern peruskoulu in 1974, as was every other school in Laukaa.\nAn animal husbandry school was established on the lands of the Saarikko and Finni-Uusitalo farms in 1925, with a total area of 260.83 ha (644.5 acres). A weaving school that had operated on the lands of Saarikko since 1905 was relocated to Petäjävesi. In 1944, most of the building was granted to an agricultural school evacuated from the town of Sortavala, as it was occupied by and soon ceded to the Soviet Union. The school became state-owned in 1961 and was relocated to Tarvaala in the municipality of Saarijärvi in 1963.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nLiterature",

        "content": "On May 1, 2024, a month-long boycott against Canadian grocery retail corporation Loblaw Companies and its supermarkets began. The boycott was organized by Reddit community r/loblawsisoutofcontrol and later spread nationally, amidst accusations against Loblaw of engaging in corporate greed practices such as greedflation and price gouging, due to the corporation recording major profits whilst heavily increasing grocery prices.\nThe boycott aims to encourage Canadian consumers to abstain from shopping at Loblaw-owned stores and instead seek locally-owned alternatives such as small businesses, with the goal to pressure Loblaw into lowering grocery prices and signing Canada's Grocery Code of Conduct, which has been proposed by ministers to \"address the concerns of processors, producers and independent grocers regarding increased retailer fees on suppliers and the need for balance in the supplier-retailer relationship, while also ensuring that Canadians continue to have access to a reliable food supply at affordable prices.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\nLoblaw Companies is the largest grocer and supermarket chain in Canada, owning several stores and brands including Loblaws, Atlantic Superstore, Joe Fresh, No Frills, No Name, President's Choice, Shoppers Drug Mart, Dominion Stores, and more. Amidst the early-2020s inflation surge, the corporation began garnering substantial profits, first evidenced by a 30% increase in profits in its third-quarter results for 2022 compared to the previous year. Loblaw's next quarterly results showed further profits with a simultaneous rise in grocery prices. In late 2022, a study conducted by Dalhousie University found that Loblaw, along with the two other largest grocers, Metro and Sobeys, had all reported yearly profits that were \"above average\" compared to their five-year averages. These grocers were also the subject of \"greedflation\" accusations by critics at the time, who argued that \"they are profiteering at a time when food prices are rising at the fastest rate in more than 40 years.\" The study highlighted Loblaw's profits for outperforming both their past-five-year average and individual year performances.\nIn early February 2024, an online petition seeking for Loblaw to be investigated for \"pandemic profiteering and greedflation\" was created, which has since received over 100,000 signatures.\n\n\n== Boycott ==\nIn October or November 2023, Emily Johnson, a mental health worker from Milton, Ontario, established the Reddit community r/loblawsisoutofcontrol, which over time accumulated thousands of members who utilized the platform to share their complaints and criticisms about Canadian grocers, particularly Loblaws. The community quickly started gaining popularity in January 2024, when Loblaw Companies made a controversial raise in discount prices for sell by date–approaching food in their grocery stores, and began organizing a boycott campaign against Loblaw, which was to be held throughout the entire month of May 2024. As the month drew near, the movement gained popularity among shoppers in Canada, and the Reddit community had grown to over 60,000 members by the onset of the boycott.\nOn May 1, 2024, the boycott against Loblaw and its chains officially began. The boycott encourages Canadian consumers to abstain from shopping at Loblaw-owned grocery stores, instead seeking locally-owned alternatives such as small businesses. The aim of the boycott is to pressure Loblaw into making a 15% reduction on their grocery prices, and signing Canada's Grocery Code of Conduct, a proposed process created by Agriculture and Food ministers throughout Canada to “address the concerns of processors, producers and independent grocers regarding increased retailer fees on suppliers and the need for balance in the supplier-retailer relationship, while also ensuring that Canadians continue to have access to a reliable food supply at affordable prices.” Previously, Loblaw as well as Walmart have both refused to sign onto the code of conduct.\nOn the same day marking the start of the boycott, Loblaw reported CA$459 million in profits out of CA$13.58 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2024, a 9.8% increase in profits and a 4.5 percent increase in revenue from last year.\n\n\n=== \"Steal From Loblaws Day\" ===\nDuring mid-April 2024, anonymous posters were placed around Toronto and in Atlantic Canada advertising the \"first annual Steal From Loblaws Day\" along with the date May 12, 2024. The posters additionally attached multiple logos of Loblaw's divisions. Organizers of the Reddit group have publicly stated that the posters were unrelated to their boycott.\n\n\n=== Impact ===\nIn the first couple of days of boycotts, Canadians have claimed to have seen less traffic towards Loblaw stores, with some videos circulating on social media showing almost-empty parking lots of Loblaw-run stores. Individuals running smaller grocery businesses and co-ops have additionally noticed an increase in customers since the beginning of the boycott.\nAround the beginning of the boycott, Loblaw made attempts to contact those involved with organizing it. On May 3, 2024, r/loblawsisoutofcontrol creator Johnson had a meeting with Per Bank, the CEO and president of Loblaw, sharing \"shoppers' concerns and questions\" with him.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nFrançois-Philippe Champagne, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, said that he \"isn't surprised to see consumers organizing boycotts,\" adding that \"Canadians are hurting.\"\nOn April 30, Sylvain Charlebois, a food professor at Dalhousie University, sponsored by Loblaws, and outspoken critic of opposing arguments made against Canadian grocery inflation, referred to the boycott on a columnist piece for the Toronto Sun as \"embarrassing attempts of a group that isn’t even trying to understand how the food industry functions and how it needs to be improved,\" adding that the \"accusations of profiteering are largely unsubstantiated.\"\n\n\n=== By Loblaw officials ===\nLoblaw's Bank stated during an interview that \"the company is paying attention to customers and sees them trying to mitigate inflation by seeking out sales, buying more private-label products and shopping at discount stores.\" Bank previously released a statement in response to the upcoming boycott on April 22, stating \"Nok er nok,\" Danish for \"enough is enough,\" in reference to  “misinformation being spread online, in the media and by politicians.”\nOn May 2, 2024, Galen Weston Jr., the chairman of Loblaw, considered the boycott calls to be \"misguided criticism\" and added that given their significance in Canada's grocery business, \"it is natural that Loblaw would be singled out as a focal point for media and government and of course consumer frustrations.” Weston denied Loblaw's alleged responsibility in the rising costs of groceries, adding that \"inflation is a global issue and is not specific to our company or to our industry.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of boycotts\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Camino Viejo de Candelaria (also Camino de Candelaria, Camino Real de Candelaria and Camino de Nuestra Señora de Candelaria) is an old pilgrimage route, declared in part of its route an Bien de Interés Cultural, with the category of Historical Site, since 2008. It runs through the municipalities of Candelaria, El Rosario, San Cristóbal de La Laguna and slightly Santa Cruz de Tenerife on the island of Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). It is linked to the cult of the Virgin of Candelaria (patroness of the Canary Islands).\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n21 kilometer long path, which corresponds to the path that connected the old capital of Tenerife, San Cristóbal de La Laguna, with the coastal center of Candelaria. It leaves La Laguna along the Camino de San Francisco de Paula, through Los Baldíos and Llano del Moro, to head as the first major milestone on the route to the Church of Our Lady of El Rosario in Machado, continuing through the payments from Barranco Hondo and Igueste de Candelaria to the Marian villa.\n\nFrom very early times it became an annual pilgrimage route, linked to religious devotion to the Virgin of Candelaria and her sanctuary. This path is already mentioned in the land distribution documents carried out by Adelantado Alonso Fernández de Lugo after the conquest. In the text by Alonso de Espinosa, referring to the miracles of the Virgin of Candelaria, he alludes to the opening of the road in the second decade of the 16th century, while indicating that around 1534 the hermitage of Nuestra Lady of the Rosary, as a resting place for pilgrims who went on pilgrimage. At the same time, it was the path used by the procession that carried the image of the Virgin of Candelaria in prayer, when it was taken to La Laguna due to the various calamities that affected the island.\nIt is therefore one of the oldest roads on the island and, possibly, one of the greatest heritage value, taking into account its antiquity, and the historical, religious and ideological circumstances that surround its future, without forgetting the ethnographic values derived of the construction of traditional paths, delimited by dry stone walls, with firm paving in the most difficult sectors and adaptation to the morphology of the terrain.\nCurrently, it continues to be used as one of the Pilgrimage routes to Candelaria. The institutionalized route of the Old road of Candelaria, organized by the town councils of El Rosario and Candelaria, takes place annually at the end of January (within the framework of the liturgical festival of the Virgin).\n\n\n== See also ==\nPilgrimage to Candelaria\nHermano Pedro's Way\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSitio web oficial del Proyecto de recuperación integral del Camino Viejo de Candelaria",

        "content": "Lin Zhijian's paper plagiarism case  is an academic dishonesty incident in Taiwan's history. In July 2022, Lin Zhijian, a recent Department of Science graduate and Technology Management of Chung Hua University and the National Development Institute of National Taiwan University with two master's degrees and who announced participation in the mayoral election of Taoyuan City was accused by Wang Hongwei and others of copying two thesis. Zhonghua University and Taiwan University, respectively, both concluded that Lin Zhijian's thesis involved plagiarism and violated academic integrity, and their master's degree was revoked. Lin Zhijian was involved in copyright issues for plagiarism, which were also filed in civil infringement and criminal proceedings.\nLin Zhijian, who once served as a member of the Hsinchu City Council and the mayor of Hsinchu City is regarded as the future star of the youth of the Democratic Progressive Party. The controversy, which violates academic ethics, hurts Lin's Democratic Progressive Party in the 2022 Taiwanese local elections.\n\n\n== Background ==\nLin Zhijian, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, went to the Department of Science and Technology Management to study for a master's degree when he was an assistant to Ker Chien-ming, a legislative member of the same party. His master's degree thesis, \"Evaluation of the Satisfaction of Residents around a Science Park in China in TCSI Mode,\" was written by [3] under the guidance of He Lixing, and the oral was completed in July 2008. In addition, in April 2008, He Lixing, Lin Zhijian, and Wang Minglang (one of the oral committee members) jointly signed up for the \"Academic Seminar on Management Strategy and Economic Development.\" They jointly published the article \"Evaluation of public satisfaction in Hsinchu Science Industrial Park by TCSI Mode.\"\nLater, after Lin Zhijian's 2013 tenure at the National Taiwan University National Development Initiatives Institute, he was elected mayor of Hsinchu City Council after Professor Chen Ming-tong, under the guidance of, wrote a master's thesis on the leverage of the political and social foundation and its influence: in the 2014 Hsinchu mayor election as an example, in the January 2017 oral test through.\nAfter mid-2022, when Lin Zhijian announced his candidacy for mayor of Taoyuan, Wang Hongwei, a kuomintang, held a press conference to accuse Lin of plagiarism in his dissertation. Plagiarism is regarded as an election issue, and the comments of all parties are mainly influenced by the positions of political parties.\n\n\n== Chung Hua University paper ==\n\n\n=== Put forward a report ===\nDuring Lin Zhijian's participation in the results of the 2018 Taiwanese magistrate, some netizens discussed his master's degree from Zhonghua University, but it did not arouse many echoes. During the 2020 Taiwanese presidential election, Hsu Yung-ming, the Legislative Yuan of the New Power Party, once accused Lin Zhijian of plagiarism for his master's thesis at China University. However, Lin Zhijian and his guidance professor, He Lixing, had already clarified and denied it. However, the power of The Times refuted Lin Zhijian's statement, indicating that the press conference in July 2020 accused the legislator Cheng Chen-chien of copying his thesis and did not mention Lin Zhijian.\nOn July 5, 2022, Taipei City Councilor Wang Hongwei, a member of the Kuomintang, held a press conference to accuse Lin Zhijian of plagiarism in his master's thesis at Chung Hua University She accused Lin Zhijian of copying the 2007 Hsinchu Science Park commissioned Chung Hua University to handle the research bidding case \"evaluating the public satisfaction of Hsinchu Science Park in TCSI mode\" final report \"evaluating the surrounding resident satisfaction of Hsinchu Science Industrial Park in TCSI mode\" (signed by Li Youzheng and Wang Minglang). Wang Hongwei hoped that Chung Hua University would properly investigate and suggested that Lin Zhijian volunteer to \"return\" his degree. On July 6, Wang Hongwei and Taoyuan City Council candidate Ling Tao jointly held a press conference to announce that Lin Zhijian's paper from Zhonghua University was suspected of copying the text of Quality Monthly in December 2005, and the text similarity reached 94.1%.\nWang Hongwei publicly announced it again on July 28. She received a whistle-blower complaint showing that at an international symposium held in Beijing in October 2008, Wang Minglang and two other graduate students, surnamed Wang and surnamed Zhong, published an English paper titled \"Applying the TCSI model to evaluate the stakeholder's satisfaction nearby Hsinchu Science Industrial Park (Chinese Translation: Using the TCSI model to evaluate the satisfaction of interested people near Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park).\" Lin Zhijian and his thesis guidance professor, He Lixing, were not named in it. After comparison, the paper published in Beijing is the same as that published by Lin Zhijian, Wang Minglang, and He Lixing in the China University seminar, but the paper is \"English,\" the chart content of the paper is the same in the same order, and all the conclusions and figures are entirely the same.\n\n\n=== Lin Zhijian responded ===\nLin Zhijian responded that he participated in the bamboo science-commissioned research and also published a seminar paper with the same name as He Lixing and Wang Minglang. [17] He thinks his behavior is not plagiarism, and He Lixing and Wang Minglang also issued a written statement to endorse him, Wang Hongwei in the Chung Hua university to bamboo administration plan application; according to the plan application, architecture planning is responsible by Wang Mingming, investigation and analysis is by Wang Mingming and He Lixing is responsible for the report by Wang Mingming and Li Youzhi is responsible for writing, Lin Zhijian is an unpaid research assistant and is responsible for \"assist in the investigation,\" so Wang Hongwei says that Lin Zhijian \"just help send questionnaire\" rather than the original, and points out that the bamboo final report cover host is \"Dr. Li Youzhi, Dr. Wang Minglang,\" no Lin Zhijian.\nOn July 24, Lin Zhijian and lawmaker Cheng Yun-peng held a press conference, expressing in chronological order that his copyright ownership of the master's degree at the Discipline Management Institute of China is also his research process.\nIn addition, On July 6, Lin Zhijian appointed a lawyer to the Hsinchu District Prosecutor's Office to accuse the prosecutor Wang Hongwei of criminal law. After he was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office, the North Prosecutor punished him. Wang Hongwei is fighting against Lin Zhijian, who was falsely accused; the north inspection is still under investigation.\n\n\n=== Academic review and results ===\nIn the examination and approval process, Lin Zhijian once attended an explanation.\nOn August 24, Chung Hua University announced the results of the review, confirming that Lin Zhijian's plagiarism was a serious violation of academic ethics, revoked Lin Zhijian's master's degree, and also sent a letter to the National Library to remove Lin Zhijian's paper from the shelves. According to the statement, He Lixing, the guiding professor of Lin Zhijian's thesis, and Li Youzhi, the member of the oral examination, are the co-host and the host of the plan, respectively, but do not investigate the final report of his master's thesis and the plan, which is obviously negligent, and will be sent to the teaching evaluation committee for review.\nIn early October, Lin filed a lawsuit with the Ministry of Education over the administrative action of Chung Hua University to revoke his degree.[31] After the trial of the lawsuit review committee, the Ministry of Education rejected the lawsuit filed by Lin Zhijian with the decision on January 19, 2023, of Taiwan Education Law (3) No. 1110094222, believing that Chung Hua University was punished in accordance with the regulations and the cancellation of Lin Zhijian's master's degree was not wrong. Lin Zhijian also apologized on his personal Facebook fan page on February 14, 2023, for revoking the punishment of Zhonghua University, respecting the resolution of the Litigation Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, and not filing an administrative lawsuit.\n\n\n=== Copyright problem ===\nLing Tao and Yang Zhi-dou, a KMT Taipei city councilor candidate, went to the Taipei District People's Office on July 6 to accuse Lin Zhijian of violating the Copyright Law. Wang also accused the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office of Lin, his professors, and others of violating the copyright law.\nAccording to the contract between the Hsinchu Science Park Administration and Chung Hua University, the property rights of the works in the closing report belong to the Bamboo Science Administration. In a statement, the bureau, on the evening of July 6, asked Chung Hua University to make an explanation. The administration has also publicly stated that no one has applied for authorization to use the closing report. Bamboo Science Administration Bureau and Zhonghua University have exchanged many official letters and discussions. On December 30, 2022, the bureau filed a civil lawsuit against Lin Zhijian for violation of the Copyright Law and filed a criminal complaint to the Hsinchu Local Procuratorate in Taiwan on January 3, 2023.\n\n\n== National Taiwan University thesis ==\n\n\n=== Put forward a report ===\nOn July 5, media practitioners Huang Yangming, Taiwan University, Institute of National Development Professor Du Zhenhua, and Lin Zhitsu in the National Development Institute presented a master's thesis on the three campaigns of leveraged political and social foundation and its influence in 2014, Hsinchu mayor election, for example, was suspected of copying another national development institute graduate student Yu Zhenghuang master'she tsis. The next day, Xu Xiaoxin sent an official letter to the National Taiwan University, stating that Lin Zhijian's paper was suspected of copying Yu Zhenghuang's paper.\n\n\n=== Response and rebuttal ===\nLin Zhijian and his guidance professor, Chen Ming-tong, offered some responses, arguing that Lin Zhijian's paper was original and did not copy Yu Zhenghuang's paper.\n\n\n==== Data Use ====\nChen Ming-tong, Lin's guidance professor, mentioned on July 5 that the poll data used by Yu Zhenghuang's dissertation resulted from an internal poll of Lin Zhijian's campaign office. After Lin's approval, Chen provided it to Yu as research material.[48] Yu Zhenghuang's acknowledgements in the paper also mention that Lin Zhijian provided his research data. Chen Mingtong believes that \"Lin Zhijian and Yu Zhenghuang did not copy\" because Lin Yu's paper was based on the data collected by the same election and the same questionnaire; the outside world questioned that the part with similar words and grammar is \"operational definition.\"  Of course, it would be the same.\n\n\n==== Complete the timing ====\nThe informant argued that Yu Zhenghuang conducted the oral examination of the paper earlier than Lin Zhijian, so from the time sequence, Yu Zhenghuang finished the paper earlier. In addition, Lin Zhijian's master's thesis cites Yu Zhenghuang's master's thesis as reference material.\nLin Zhijian said that his paper was written before Yu Zhenghuang and proposed (1) sending professor Chen Mingtong to Lin Zhijian and Secretary Yang Lingyan on February 1, 2016, and (2) having Yu Zhenghuang complete the research plan on March 8 as evidence. Lin Zhijian's Taiwan University master's thesis guidance professor Chen Mingtong also said that Yu Zhenghuang originally wrote an unsatisfactory master's thesis plan and wanted to change the topic, so he contacted him. After obtaining Lin Zhijian's consent, Chen Mingtong provided the first draft of Lin Zhijian's paper as a demonstration and suggestion to Yu for reference. However, he must still inform Yu Zhenghuang that it was Lin Zhijian's first draft. Both papers are similar (such as a typo); both first appeared in Lin Zhijian's research plan on February 1.\nYu responded that he had not read Lin Zhijian's paper when the incident broke out in 2022.\nelse\nLin's lawyer said on July 28 that Lin's paper was original and neither side was copied because Chen's teaching and guidance in writing the paper were similar. Yu Zhenghuang's lawyer told Lin Zhijian that he was original and said Lin Zhijian's view was politically original and academic, which is plagiarism.\nLin Zhijian's lawyer also argued that because the research is reasonable, Lin Zhijian's paper is original. Lin Zhijian took the poll data of \"abandoning protection\" Cai Renjian as the research item to prove the phenomenon of three changes; Yu Zhenghuang did not set the change, but there is still a paragraph. Moreover, Lin Zhijian assumes voters will support CAI Renjian because of his high education. However, Yu Zhenghuang, who uses the same data, believes that voters will support Lin Zhijian. However, Lin Zhijian needs to be more highly educated, and Yu Zhenghuang's research logic needs to be revised. Yu Zhenghuang's lawyer responded that Yu's paper writing time needed longer and was inevitably flawed.\nLin's lawyer also argued that both Lin and Yu's master theses mentioned \"we ask further\" in the poll, and the poll data came from Lin's campaign; using the first person was reasonable, but Yu used other people's information, using \"we\" was strange. Yu Zhenghuang's lawyer responded that Yu's paper writing time needed longer and was inevitably flawed.\nIn the wording part, Yu Zhenghuang's appointed lawyer also mentioned that Lin and Yu mistakenly wrote Xu Mingcai's degree \"Dominken University\" as \"Dominican University,\" and both wrote that Lin Zhijian was a \"prospective master.\" You can clearly say that the reason for the wrong marking of education was to directly quote the incorrect information on the official website of the Kuomintang and to call Lin Zhijian a \"prospective master\" because he did not know that Lin Zhijian had a master's degree from Chung Hua University. Lawyers questioned that if Lin had completed his thesis, he should not call himself a prospective master. The lawyer also said Lin and Yu had the same paragraph of the paper, while Yu Zhenghuang had cited references, but Lin Zhijian did not. Lin Zhijian copied other researchers for this paragraph, if not Yu Zhenghuang.\n\n\n=== Academic Review and Results ===\nTaiwan University announced on July 6 that it had received the complaint and would complete it within two months. The school received a report containing Lin Zhijian copying Yu Zhenghuang, Yu Zhenghuang copying Lin Zhijian, and two people copying each other three; according to the school rules, the Academy of Social Sciences approved the report on the July 17 approval committee, the dean of the Academy of Social Sciences Su Hongda convener, based on the information provided to the committee of the information, and the accused to the committee replied data approval (but not including the parties not submitted to the committee, data published in other places).\nAfter starting the investigation, Su Hongda mentioned that the academic dishonesty was a \"scandal\" in an email  to the hospital. Lin Zhijian believed Su Hongda was \"judged before trial\" and applied to order Su Hongda to avoid review. However, the committee rejected Lin Zhijian's application  at a meeting on the 27th.\nTaiwan University compared their papers through the comparison software, and the results were more than 40% similar. After the discussion, the substantive review was taken paragraph by paragraph, and the related people were invited to attend the meeting for an explanation. The committee invited Lin Zhijian (3 times), guidance professor Chen Mingtong (3 times), and Yu Zhenghuang (2 times) to explain that the first two were not present, and Yu Zhenghuang only went to the meeting once. Lin Zhijian said that he thought the convener, Su Hongda, was biased against him, so he only submitted a written statement and refused to attend \nAfter comparison by the committee, the plagiarism was confirmed. However, because the two papers were highly similar and not correctly quoted, according to academic practice, the publisher, Lin Zhijian (January 2017), copied the first publisher, Yu Zhenghuang (July 2016). On August 9, National Taiwan University held a press conference after carefully comparing the two papers, chapter by chapter, paragraph by section, and section by section, in addition to finding the same or similar. Yu Zhenghuang proposed the draft of the \"January 28, 2016 version.\" It was confirmed that Yu Zhenghuang had no plagiarism, but Lin Zhijian copied the master's thesis, and the circumstances are severe enough to suggest cancelling the degree. The Academic Affairs Office agreed to review the report and revoke Lin Zhijian's master's degree. On the same day, Taiwan University sent a letter to the National Library of China, informing Lin that Zhijian's degree had been revoked and requesting the removal of his paper and electronic papers under Article 17 of the Degree Awarding Law of the Ministry of Education and point 11 of the violation of doctoral and master's degrees.\nLin Zhijian himself refused to recognize the approval results of Taiwan University; on September 6, against the punishment of Taiwan University for revoking his degree, he filed a lawsuit against the Ministry of Education. However, Lin Zhijian posted on Facebook on February 14, 2023, that he withdrew the petition, and the Ministry of Education also closed the case by law.\nIn addition, after Taiwan University decided to revoke his degree, Qian Yijun publicly alleged that two assistants wrote Lin Zhijian's thesis. However, Taiwan University responded that since the accused's degree had been revoked, the examination target no longer existed and would not be examined again.\n\n\n==== Questions for directing the professor ====\nFollowing the accusation of Lin Zhijian, Wang Hongwei reported to the Ministry of Education and Taiwan University on August 1, which was also suspected of violating academic ethics. On August 9, when Taiwan University announced the results of the academic ethics review, it also indicated that Chen Ming Tong, as the guiding professor, \"should be clear and remind the relevant academic norms\", which is suspected of dereliction of duty. The school receives the report and will form a review committee to investigate and approve it. Chen Ming, then head of the National Security Bureau (Taiwan), told a friend that if Taiwan University launched an investigation against him, he would thoroughly explain it.\nChen Mingtong has not applied for the National Development Institute since the 111th academic year (August 2022). In his teaching career (1995–2022), he has guided at least 173 master's and doctoral students to write their dissertations, including Lin Zhijian, Zheng Wencan, Pan Meng'a Gao Jiayu, Guo Guowen, Qiu Zhiwei, Shen Anhui, and other dignitaries. Of the 173 students, only five were in public electronic full text and were questioned by management scholar Lai Shibao about whether they were afraid of being tested.\nOn August 10, Chung Xiaoping, a Taipei city councillor, went to the Control Yuan to report Chen, saying that Chen forced Yu to take responsibility for the paper and even met with Yu. His accusations include Chen Mingdong reversing the wrong and telling Lin Zhijian that he had taken the data to Yu Zhenghuang, but Taiwan University proved Lin plagiarised. Chen Mingtong has five student thesis topics. The study of Hong Kong changes, subjectivity, structure, and conclusion are the same; Chen Mingtong is a topic for five students. He suggested that Chen publish 170 papers guiding students and put the content in the National Library of China.\n\n\n==== Copyright problem ====\nYu Zhenghuang, an investigation officer of the Hsinchu Investigation Station of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau, faced a faced a private prosecution on September 29, accusing Lin Zhijian of violating the Copyright Law. After the mediation arranged by the Taiwan Taipei District Court, they settled on June 10, 2023. As long as Lin Zhijian donated 300,000 yuan to public welfare groups, Yu agreed to withdraw the private lawsuit under the Copyright Law and told the Taipei Local Procuratorate's Office. Because Yu Zhenghuang told the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office, Lin Zhijian was also told not to prosecute.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\n\n=== Academic ethics norms have been tightened.Academic ethics norms have been tightened ===\nNational Taiwan University announced on July 6, 2022, that from that day, all master and doctoral students must use the original comparison of text similarity before leaving the.\n\n\n=== Impact of the election situation ===\nIn mid-2022, Lin Zhijian announced that he would represent the Democratic Progressive Party in the Taoyuan mayoral election. His paper was publicly accused of plagiarism by many people, and the first whistleblower, Wang Hongwei, from the KMT, became a hot topic in the election campaign after Lin Zhijian announced his candidacy.。For example, the KMT suggested that Chen Ming-tong, president of GuoGuoan and party chairman, apologize for criticizing Lin for violating academic ethics and losing personal integrity.\nIn the Democratic Progressive Party, Gao Jiayu, a member of the party, said that the dispute between Lin Zhijian's paper and the Hsinchu Stadium would have a negative impact on the northern candidates in the 2022 Taiwanese local elections, so some people suggested replacing Lin Zhijian. Zheng Yunpeng, a party official elected by Lin Zhijian in Taoyuan and another member of parliament, opposed Gao's views and accused her of \"apparently not reading the complete information and not understanding her party members.\"\nOn August 10, the next day after the cancellation of his degree by Taiwan University, Tsai Ing-wen, chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, said at a party meeting that \"we are willing to believe that Zhijian did not copy\" and instructed party members to believe Lin Zhijian. \"We will shout to everyone that Lin Zhijian did not copy.\" However, on August 12, after the DPP held a temporary election response meeting, Lin Zhijian said in a press conference that he would voluntarily withdraw from the election, with his assistant cadre Zheng Yunpeng taking over to participate in the Taoyuan mayoral election.\nIn the 2022 Taiwanese local elections, the Democratic Progressive Party was greatly defeated. The post-election official review report submitted by the DPP pointed out that after the outbreak of Lin Zhijian's paper plagiarism incident, the failure to timely and properly handle it caused public dissatisfaction. The hasty withdrawal from the election affected the trust of young people, and the whole incident had a negative impact on the election situation.\n\n\n== explanatory note ==\n\n2. Yu Zhenghuang's master's thesis is entitled \"Research on the Election of Hsinchu Mayor in 2014: An Analysis of the Political and Social Foundation of Lin Zhijian\". The guiding professor is Li Bihan, and one of the oral committee members is Chen Mingtong (guiding Professor Lin Zhijian).\n3. Then the head of the National Security Bureau (Taiwan). The NNSA coordinated the institutions of the Republic of China, so Chen Mingtong was the head of investigator Yu Zhenghuang.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alexander Nikolayevich Astashev (Russian: Александр Николаевич Асташев; born November 17, 1956), known as The Cheremkhovo Poisoner (Russian: Черемховский отравитель), is a Russian serial killer and robber who, together with his wife and another female accomplice, poisoned 31 people across various oblasts from 2003 to 2005. From these, 17 proved fatal.\nAll three would later be arrested, with Astashev being ruled incompetent to stand trial while his accomplices were imprisoned.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAlexander Astashev was born on November 17, 1956, in the town of Cheremkhovo, Irkutsk Oblast. Little is known about his childhood and adolescent years.\nDuring the Soviet and post-Soviet years, Astashev was incarcerated multiple times for a variety of offenses, beginning when he was a child in 1972. In 1982, he was caught abusing a child and later attempted to escape while being transported to prison, for which he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. After serving it out in full, he returned to Cheremkhovo in 1997. Not long after, he was arrested for an incident in which one person was stabbed to death and another serioulsy wounded - however, it was ruled to be a case of excessive self-defense, and Astashev received only a minor prison sentence.\nIn that same year, he married a local resident, Natalia, who was 20 years younger than him and worked as the head teacher at a kindergarten. A daughter was born out of this marriage, and Astashev had to resort to working odd jobs to earn money. During later interviews with police, he complained about how hard life is in a mining town, leading to suspicions that he began his criminal activities for monetary gain.\n\n\n== Murders ==\n\n\n=== Modus operandi ===\nAstashev teamed up with his wife and 19-year-old mistress Anastasia Musikhina, who aided him in most of the crimes. Traveling around Irkutsk Oblast and later on in other regions, Astashev sought out elderly people on the streets and presented himself as a doctor – to make himself more believable, he always wore a medical coat, a tonometer, and a phonendoscope. During the conversation, he would ask them about their health and offered to treat them for free at home - if the victim accepted, Astashev and his accomplices would go to the house, where he would perform superficial medical procedures to put the victim at ease. Once trust was earned, he would give his victims a handful of potent sleeping pills (aminazine, suprastin and barbiturates) and a low-alcohol fruit-flavored drink kept in a balm bottle, which he presented as a \"syrup\". Soon after taking this mixture, the victim would either fall asleep or die, whereupon Astashev and his accomplices would ransack the apartment, stealing various appliances, precious jewelry, money, and in some cases even food and drinks from the refrigerator.\nAstashev committed his first crime on October 13, 2003, in the village of Zalari, Irkutsk Oblast. The victims were an elderly couple, with the husband succumbing to acute poisoning on the way to the hospital, while his wife managed to survive. Everything of value was stolen from their house.\nIn the spring of 2004, Astashev committed his first crime with the aid of his wife, who presented herself as a \"nurse\". Clad in a medical coat, he went to the village of Nizhnyaya Iret and tricked a local couple into drinking his concoction, which knocked them out. While the couple were unconscious, the Astashevs stole a variety of items totaling 17.5 thousand rubles and fled in a Lada Niva. Five days later, one of the victims, a 67-year-old, died from complications relating to this incident.\nIn the summer of 2004, Astashev drugged and robbed a resident of Krasnoyarsk Krai at the Tayshet railway station, but the woman managed to survive and informed the police about the incident. After giving a detailed description of the supposed \"doctor\", authorities quickly identified him as Alexander Astashev, and he was thereafter put on the federal wanted list.\nAstashev's most prolific period lasted from June 2004 to August 2005 – having committed five fatal poisoning in the Irkutsk Oblast, he and his accomplices soon switched to traveling to other regions to avoid being caught by police. In Perm, while waiting at a train station, he met a man with a number of illnesses who accepted his treatment proposal, after which Astashev took him to a secluded area and gave him nine pills and some beer. This victim survived the ordeal. In the town of Zuyevka, Kirov Oblast, Astashev and Musikhina, wearing medical robes, gave a medicinal mixture to a local pensioner, claiming that they were employees of the Kirov Hospital and that they were bringing free pills from the Central Pharmacy. On August 31, 2005, a WWII veteran was fatally poisoned in Kirov, in what proved to be Astashev's last murder. Other such attacks were recorded in the Chita Oblast (now Zabaykalsky Krai), the Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug (now part of Irkutsk Oblast) and several cities in Udmurtia.\nA special investigative division was not formed for a long time due to the fact that Astashev and his accomplices constantly moving around, which were initially considered unrelated to one another. In addition, the deaths of pensioners were often written off as coronary heart disease, and thus criminal cases were never initiated.\n\n\n== Arrest, investigation and trial ==\nIn September 2005, Astashev and his accomplices were finally apprehended in Glazov, Udmurtia. During subsequent investigations into his activities while a fugitive, authorities discovered that he was responsible for 31 robberies committed across multiple regions, with 17 of them proving fatal.\nThe investigation into the extent of the crimes lasted for two years, and during that time, investigators started to suspect that Astashev suffered from mental abnormalities, but was initially ruled sane when checked in at a local psychiatric hospital. Later on, by request of his lawyer, he was transferred to the Serbsky Center, where a forensic psychiatric exam ruled him to be suffering from a particularly severe form of paranoid schizophrenia.\nOn August 6, 2008, the Irkutsk Regional Court ordered that Astashev must undergo compulsory medical treatment in a specialized psychiatric institution with intensive supervision, as he posed a significant danger to society due to his delusions, impulsiveness and destructive behavior, as well as the severity of his crimes. His wife Natalia was sentenced to 7.5 years imprisonment with 5 years of probation, while Musikhina was given 6 years imprisonment with five years' probation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Russian serial killers\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ubaidullah Khan (1476–1539) was the 4th Shaybanid Khan of Bukhara, who ruled between 1534 and 1539. He was the son of Mahmud and nephew of Muhammad Shaybani, founder of the Shaybanid dynasty.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAfter the death of Muhammad Shaybani in 1510, the cities and lands controlled by the Uzbeks were divided among the family members. Bukhara fell to Ubaidullah Khan, which he had to defend against Babur Emir of Kabul and future Mughal Emperor, and against the Safavids of Iran in 1511/12. Ubaidullah and Jani Beg, the commander-in-chief of the army, proved themselves as capable generals. Babur's defeat at Gadjdivan in 1512 finally secured the Uzbeks' possession of the land between Amu Darya and Syr Darya.\n\nUbaidullah was not only a military man and politician, but also an amateur scholar, poet and builder. His time saw the construction of the Kalan Mosque in 1514, next to the Kalyan Minaret from the 12th century on the site of an old palace mosque, and the construction of the Mir Arab Madrasa (1535/36) in Bukhara. The madrasa was financed by Ubaidullah by selling 3,000 captured Shiites into slavery.\nHowever, Ubaidullah failed to defeat Iranian Shah Tahmasp I (ruled 1524–76), as his five offensives in Khorasan were ultimately unsuccessful. In September 1528 he suffered a defeat in the Battle of Turbet-i-Sheikh Jam, where the Iranians had deployed artillery for the first time. Furthermore, unlike him, his commanders were not interested in permanently occupying Khorasan. The plundering of the country was enough for them. Likewise, the Uzbek Khan Abu Sa'id, who ruled Samarkand between 1530 and 1533, had no interest in strengthening Ubaidullah's domestic power and refused to help him.\nFinally, in 1538, Ubaidullah, now Khan himself, moved against the independent Khwarazm, the later Khanate of Khiva, and killed the local Khan Avanish, but was soon driven out by his son Din Muhammed. Shortly after this defeat, he died and was buried in the Mir Arab Madrasa. Power struggles broke out among the Uzbeks which lasted until 1556.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nHoworth, Henry Hoyle.

        "content": "Jeffrey Hass (born November 24, 1953, in New York) is a contemporary American classical composer of acoustic and electroacoustic music. He is best known for his compositions combining electronic soundtracks with solo instruments or with large ensembles such as wind ensemble and orchestra. He currently serves the Jacobs School of Music as professor emeritus.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHass studied at the Stecher and Horowitz School of Music from 1960 to 1971. He then attended Vassar College and graduated with a B.A. in music in 1975. He continued his education at Rutgers University, earning an M.A. in Music Composition and Theory in 1979. Finally, he received a D.Mus. in Composition, Theory and Electronic Music, with High Distinction, from the Indiana University School of Music in 1989.\nHass was a composition faculty member at the Jacobs School of Music of Indiana University (retiring in 2019) where he served as Director of the School's Center for Electronic and Computer Music from 1984 to 2019. He was also appointed adjunct professor of Dance Technology in 2007 and currently serves the Jacobs School as professor emeritus.\nLater in his career, he developed an interest in composing works for contemporary dance and ballet, often accompanied by visual projection. Several of his video works are for prerecorded dancers placed in a virtual 3D motion graphics environment or for live interactive video projection based on dancers’ movements and actions.\nUpon retirement, Hass produced an online electronic textbook, Introduction to Computer Music, which has been adopted for courses around the world. He had previously served on the music faculty of Rutgers University-Newark and the Interlochen Center for the Arts.\nHass's acoustic compositions have been performed by the Louisville Orchestra, Memphis Symphony Orchestra, American Concerto Orchestra (Chicago), the U.S. Army Band and the Concordia Chamber Orchestra.

The name of the dish comes from the city of Kolkata in West Bengal. Rice is used as the base ingredient, and meat, eggs, potatoes and spices are added. It is best known for its use of potatoes, and is famous for its light blend of spices.\nAlthough there is uncertainty about the exact origin of biryani, it is believed to have originated in Iran. Historians and experts agree that the dish known as modern day \"Biryani\" was invented in Delhi during the Mughal period. The Kolkata style of Biryani was invented in the fifties and sixties of the nineteenth century.\nKolkata biryani is very popular in the city of Kolkata and its suburbs, also popular throughout West Bengal outside Kolkata metropolitan region.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSrividya, V.

In the 2024 Portuguese national election she was elected to the Assembly of the Republic as a representative of the right-wing CHEGA party.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nRibeiro was born in Beja on 20 October 1974. She obtained a degree in mathematics from the University of Évora and went on to teach mathematics at a private school in Vila Nova de Milfontes in the Alentejo Litoral. \n\n\n== Political career ==\nRibeiro was a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) between 1986 and 2020, joining the JSD, the youth wing of the PSD, when she was twelve. In January 2024, it was announced by the president of CHEGA, André Ventura, that she would head the list of CHEGA candidates for the Beja District constituency in the March 2024 election. CHEGA won one of the three available seats in the constituency and she was duly elected. In her campaign she had argued that central government needed to pay more attention to the needs of farmers, such as those in her district, and in the National Assembly she became a member of the Agriculture and Fisheries committee.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The pilgrimage to Candelaria (popularly called the Candelaria Walk) is a religious march that takes place every year on the night of August 14 to 15 in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) towards the municipality of Candelaria where the image is located. of the Patroness of the Canary Islands, the Virgin of Candelaria. It is one of the most popular events in the Canary Islands.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe festivities of the Virgin of Candelaria that are celebrated on February 2 are a continuation of the one carried out by the conquerors in 1497 and the one on August 15 dates back to the 18th century and was financed with the alms of the town, where the appearance of the Virgin to the Guanches is remembered.\nAccording to Fray Alonso de Espinosa (1594), the current so-called cave of San Blas was a place of pilgrimage for the Guanches of Tenerife to worship Chaxiraxi (the name that the Guanches gave to the Virgin). This pilgrimage was usually carried out during the August moon or Beñesmen. The Beñesmen in the Guanche calendar was an agricultural festival where the collection of the land's products was dedicated to Chaxiraxi. The Guanches offered gofio, goat meat, milk, cereals, etc. For all this, the Pilgrimage to Candelaria is a clear vestige of the Guanche Beñesmen, which is several centuries old and was even carried out by the Menceyes (aboriginal kings).\nThe Pilgrimage to Candelaria was the precedent of a tradition deeply rooted in all the Canary Islands, that of visiting the patron saint of each of the islands on foot.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nPilgrims in general usually leave their localities or towns or from the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife or San Cristóbal de La Laguna. Many people from the north of the island also take part in this tradition, but they generally leave three days before, in order to arrive at the Candelaria on August 15, the main day of the festival. Commonly, they spend the night camping.\nGenerally, most of the route for pilgrims coming from the Metropolitan Area is the Carretera General del Sur (TF-28), which is located on the Autopista TF-1. Also parallel to the highway is the so-called \"Camino del Peregrino\" (Pilgrim's Path), a road that runs through the municipalities of Candelaria, El Rosario and Santa Cruz de Tenerife. This route also remains open throughout the year.\nRecently, the organization of the pilgrimage route to Candelaria was carried out along the old Camino Real or \"Old Road\", which connected La Laguna with Candelaria, this route has the category of Bien de Interés Cultural (BIC) with category of Historical Site. The municipalities of El Sauzal, Tacoronte, Tegueste, La Laguna, El Rosario, La Victoria de Acentejo and La Matanza de Acentejo joined this initiative in 2008.\nPilgrims arriving from other islands or the Iberian Peninsula usually arrive by boat or plane to the island, and generally leave from Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the capital. For the festivities of February 2 of the Virgin, small groups also make the pilgrimage on foot, although due to weather reasons due to the winter dates, it is not as popular as in August.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nOld road of Candelaria\nHermano Pedro's Way\n\n\n== External links ==\nCaminata a Candelaria.

It is located 447 million light-years away from the Solar System and was discovered on April 5, 1874, by Ralph Copeland.\nThe luminosity class of NGC 3754 is II and it is listed as a LINER galaxy by SIMBAD, meaning, a nucleus presenting an emission spectrum characterized by broad lines of weak ionized atoms.\n\n\n== Copeland Septet ==\n\nNGC 3754 is a member of the Copeland Septet which is made up of 7 galaxies discovered by Copeland in 1874. The other members of the group, are NGC 3745, NGC 3746, NGC 3748, NGC 3750, NGC 3751 and NGC 3753.\nHalton Arp noticed the 7 galaxies in an article published in 1966. This group is designated as Arp 320 in which PGC 36010 is part of them.\nThe 7 galaxies were also observed by Paul Hickson, in which he included them inside his article in 1982. This group is known as Hickson 57, in which NGC 3754 is designated as HCG 57D.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Haidamak uprising 1734 - was an uprising of Haidamaky bands against the power of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth over the right bank Ukraine.\n\n\n== Historical Background ==\nThe Poles took steps to attract labourers, known as settlers from other towns, to the abandoned villages, promising them exemption from service duties for 15-30 years. But years passed, benefits ran out, dominion was introduced, duties were increased, new ones were introduced. Rent had a major impact on the peasantry. In addition to lordships and other direct taxes and tributes, indirect taxes were applied, among which propination was the most difficult. The lords had the exclusive right to produce and sell spirits. They forced peasants to buy a certain amount of vodka regardless of their consumption needs. The peasants also suffered at the outposts of the Polish army.\nThe lord's arbitrariness was met with resistance from the peasants, which turned into an armed struggle, one manifestation of which was the Haydamak movement. In the second quarter of the 18th century, this movement was concentrated in the Kiev and Braclaw regions, where the most favourable conditions prevailed: the presence of a significant number of free, not fully settled people, the proximity of the borders of Zaporizhzhya Sicha, Left-Bank Ukraine, Moldavia and the Ottoman Empire.\nin general, the activity of the haidamaks began in wison and summer and ended in winter due to the temperatures that prevailed. They would congregate in the forests and join together in larger groups after winter. Mostly these troops consisted of peasants and Zaporozhian Cossacks. One of the important conditions for the success of the Haydamaks was their fast movement, so they always had good steppe horses. In horsemanship the Haydamaks were not inferior to ordinary soldiers. Their units had no rollers. It was even more difficult to deal with the Haydamaks on foot. If victory was not possible, the Haydamaks died in battle, but they did not give up. The courage and cunning of the Haydamaks, their ability to fight was appreciated even by their enemies.\n\nA unique role in the development of the Haidamat movement was played by Zaporozhye Sich, to which refugees from all over Ukraine were drawn. There, Haidamat units were formed in Zaporozhye, which included Zaporozhian Cossacks and were often led by them. In 1729-1730, the wave of Haidamat performances intensified. In December 1729 it happened in Kagaralyk, Smile, Kuzmins, Vinnitsa. At the beginning of 1730, a wide wave of Haidamat protests covered the Kiev and Braclaw provinces.\n\n\n=== Etymology \"Haidamak\" ===\n\n\n==== Hungarian Etymology ====\nHungarian etymological dictionaries (i.e. SzófSz, TESz and EWU) consider the word to be derived from the Hungarian verb hajt 'to drive away, drive away (sth, sb) (German treiben)', i.e. from the present tense participle form hajtó 'to drive away, drive away (sth, sb) (German treiber)', which, according to Hungarian etymologists, is a derivative of the Hungarian verb hajtó. from the present tense participle form hajtó 'to drive away, drive away (sth, sb), driver (German: Treiber)', which according to Hungarian etymologists yielded after the expression -t-to-d hajdú - and a change of the final -ó  to -ú [-ū]. 3 Authors of etymological dictionaries, however, have doubts about the possibility of changing -jt->-jd-, as only a few examples documenting such consonantal sonority can be found in Hungarian.A number of authors have attempted to identify similar shifts jt > jd in other languages (De Bartolomeis, Sulán)\nTherefore, regarding the change -jt-> -jd- in Kiss/Pusztai one can read the following: \"[...] Előreható részleges hasonulás: R.: hajtó > hajdú, [...] a zöngétlen t aj hatására zöngésül d-vé.\" The same process can be seen in Hung. *hajtan > hajdan 'once'; majt > majd 'later, some time' (see e.g. Kiss/Pusztai ibid.), see dialectal forms majd 'schon, bald, später': màjD ~ majt ~ majtég (Gálffy/Márton 312; also Szinnyei 1386: majt id. (Transylvania)\nLet us take a closer look at the duplicated forms hajdú and hajduk (nom. sg.) in Hungarian. The use of Hung. hajdukok (from 1527 onwards) for the plural nominative is apparently (for native speakers of Hungarian) an example of a double plural added to the subject, i.e. hajdú-k-ok. We also agree with the author that this may indicate that hajduk (the singular of the word hajdukok) was not treated as a native word. However, we believe that Hung. hajduk should be explained from SCr. hajduk as Rückwanderer, i.e. Hung. hajdú 'Viehhirt, Fußsoldat' > SCr. hajduk 'insurgent, soldier against Turkish rule in the Balkans' > Hung.hajduk identifier. This pattern seems to confirm the following.\n\n\n==== Turkish Etymology ====\nThe word was adopted into Ukrainian from Crimea and the neighbouring region, where it was used in some Kipchat , Oghuz and Slavic languages .  The origin is from the Turkish word 'haydamak', 'to ride, to drive away', and the etymological device is Ottoman Turkish .  The verb (h)ayda probably comes from the onomatopoeic stem used to agitate someone: \"hayda\".  Depending on the local context, it was understood as \"to drive someone or something away\" and later \"to chase, to pursue\".  In the infinitive, Turkish verbs have the ending -mak or -mek.  However, the ending -ak(a) also exists in Ukrainian, in words with somewhat related meanings, such as huljáka , 'crouser' (crouse = energetic, lively, confident), pyjak(a) , 'drunkard' ', rozbyšaka , 'highwayman', which may have led to the original meaning of 'pursue, prosecute' evolving to 'pursuer, pursuing' and eventually 'insurgent'.  In various other languages, the meaning of 'highwayman' given to a hajdamak(a) took shape in accordance with the way their enemies perceived the hajdamaks. \n\n\n== Uprising ==\nHowever, by 1734, Haidamat troops were being formed and operating in an uncoordinated manner. The first attempt to coordinate the actions of the Haidamat troops was made by centurion Verlan. He enrolled all rebels in the Cossack register, appointed centurions, captains, lieutenants.\nThe preparatory phase of the uprising has not been fully explained. Historical documents testify to its solemn beginning, when the centurion Verlan, who had previously served in the court militia of the Lubomyrsky princes in Shargorod, declared himself a colonel commander and published the manifesto of the uprising:\n\"Our time has come, citizens living on noble, royal and ecclesiastical estates: the time of liberation from the yoke of the nobility and release from the burdens that your lords have imposed on you. God has looked down from high heaven on your misfortune. For your tears and patience, he has heard your prayers and sent you defenders to avenge your wrongs. Help those who have undertaken to protect you and your rights. The time has come to demand payment from your enemies for your wrongs, the beatings, the torments, the unprecedented extortion you have suffered from them so far. We are sending you guides to trust and follow, regardless of your weapons. Leave your homes, your women and your beloved children and you will not regret it, for you will soon find that God has destined you to be victorious and you will all become free people once you destroy this viper tribe of your masters , who continue to suck your blood. We have called on you before, but you did not believe in success; now you can believe when your brothers have started the successful liberation from slavery and this yoke in Ukraine and Podolia. Call upon God for help and unite with us in helping\".\n\nFrom the testimony of V. Antonovich, it appears that Verlan in his appeals referred to a circular by the Russian Colonel Polansky, who called on the armed people on the Right Bank, mainly policemen, to oppose Stanislav Leshchinsky and his collaborators. In the event of success, the Cossack structures created by the insurgents would be preserved and incorporated into the Russian Empire, where at that time the relative autonomy of the Hetmanate was still preserved and the freedom of Zaporozhye was respected. The population of the Right Bank was open to the prospect of reunification with other parts of the Ukrainian nation living in more prosperous conditions. In this case, the peasants were freed from serfdom, which did not exist in Left Bank Ukraine at the time. On the other hand, researcher P. Mirchuk notes that there are no documents confirming Verlan's interaction with Polansky, and this kind of information is the result of the spread of Polish propaganda techniques aimed at discrediting the uprising.\nAccording to the testimony of V. Antonovich, while Verlan was in Shargorod, he summoned open-air militia units from other towns and began to recruit local residents. In this way, the town became the epicentre of the uprising. An army began to form, which Verlan divided into ranks and ranks ( centurions, captains, lieutenants, etc.), the rebels themselves chose centurions and tenths, which included previously separated Haidamat, Zaporozhye and even representatives of the nobility. To the army.\n\nVerlan passed through the Braclaw Land several times, and then - Podolia and south-western Volhynia, took Krzemieniec, Zhvanets, Brody and Zbarazh. His troops appeared at Kamieniec and Lviv. Hryva's detachment captured Vinnitsa and Medzibizh. Hundreds of well-organised rebels captured Korsun, Berdychev, Pogrebeshch, Pavloch, Kotelnya, Koshovate, Khodory and Rozhov in Kiev province. In Chudnov, the burghers independently dealt with the nobility. At the beginning of 1735, the uprising covered the entire territory of the Ukrainian provinces.\neseven in 1736, the Verlaan chieftains re-established themselves in the Braclaw and Kiev provinces: the Hrevsky, Medvedev, Zyla, Ore, Ivanitsky and Kharko provinces. In the spring of 1737, more than a thousand Haidamaks gathered in Zaporozhye on the Cibulnica River. They were suddenly attacked by Tatars, in a fight with whom the leaders of Kharko, Ivanitsa and Zhila were killed, and the wounded Ore was arrested.\n\n\n== Aftermatch ==\nDespite the suppression of the uprising, Haidamite bands continued to raid magnate's estates and obstruct the march. Due to the incomplete destruction of this group, it was reborn in 1750 when it started an uprising which was suppressed and then another one in 1768 which was joined by Russia in order to get rid of the rebellion for fear of spreading to their territories.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "10-Hydroxyketotifen (WR621365) is a biologically inactive metabolite of ketotifen.  Despite the mainstream scientific consensus that 10-hydroxyketotifen is a biologically inactive compound, its pharmacological properties are not very well studied outside the context of ketotifen, therefore, 10-hydroxyketotifen may still posses biological activity similarly to norketotifen, another metabolite of ketotifen.\n\n\n== Metabolic role ==\n\nKetotifen is an antihistamine medication which metabolizes to several compounds, including 10-hydroxyketotifen. Ketotifen, like other antihistamines, is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, especially CYP3A4 in the liver. The CYP enzymes are responsible for the oxidation and demethylation of ketotifen, producing the major metabolites norketotifen and 10-hydroxyketotifen. Norketotifen is pharmacologically active and has a similar potency as ketotifen, while 10-hydroxyketotifen is inactive. The metabolites are then conjugated with glucuronic acid or sulfate and excreted in the urine and feces.\nThe definition and measurement of biological activity of drugs can be complex: biological activity is often defined in terms of the ability of a molecule to effect a change in a biological process, which can be quantified and measured in various ways; as such, even if 10-hydroxyketotifen is currently deemed inactive, it is possible that under certain conditions or within specific biological assays, some level of activity might be observed.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was first described by John Gilbert Baker and published in the book \"Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany 21: 436. 1885.\". It primarily grows on wet tropical biomes. The species name came from the English word wikt:tricho- + wikt:phyllon, which means Hairy leaf. Its Conservation Status is Threatened. \n\n\n== Description ==\nWeak, flexible, and heavily pilose stems. Leaf with a 1 1/2–2 inch long blade.  \nWhen held up to the light, the midrib and lateral veins, as well as the anastomosing connecting veinlets, are clearly apparent; the petiole is between 1/2 and 3/4 inches long. The leaf is oblong at the apex, cuneate in the lower half, and membranous in texture. It is dark green and pubescent on both surfaces. On short, slender peduncles that grow to be 3–4 inches long, spikes are generated from the axils of the leaves. The stigma is sessile and globose, and the ovary is ascending and glabrous, inserted into the sulcate rhachis' grooves.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nIt is endemic to Madagascar.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is located 440 million light-years away from the Solar System and was discovered by Ralph Copeland on April 5, 1874, but also observed by Hermann Kobold, Lawrence Parsons and John Louis Emil Dreyer.  \n\nLike NGC 3746, NGC 3748 also has a recessed core (RET). It is described as, \"moderately bright, fairly small, slightly elongated NW-SE, 0.4'x0.3' with a small bright core\".\n\n\n== Copeland Septet ==\nNGC 3748 is a member of the Copeland Septet which is made up of 7 galaxies which were discovered by Copeland in 1874. The other members are NGC 3745, NGC 3746, NGC 3750, NGC 3751, NGC 3753 and NGC 3754.\nHalton Arp noticed the galaxies in this group in an article that was published in 1966. This group is known as Arp 320 along with another galaxy, PGC 36010.\nThis group was observed by Paul Hickson whom he included in his article in 1982. The group is known as Hickson 57, in which NGC 3748 is designated as HCG 57E.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Anna Camp-Bennett (née Camp; born April 9, 1998) is an American middle-distance runner who competes in the 800 m and 1500 m. Competing for Brigham Young University, she won the 1500 m at the 2021 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.\nAfter graduating from BYU, Camp-Bennett signed professionally with Adidas, and has since set personal bests of 2:00.60 in the 800 m, 4:04.99 in the 1500 m, and 4:26.95 in the mile, while remaining under the tutelage of her college coach Diljeet Taylor.\n\n\n== Athletics career ==\n\n\n=== High School ===\nCamp-Bennett attended Millard High School in her hometown of Fillmore, Utah, from 2012 to 2016, where she was an eight-time state champion on the track in events ranging from the 400 m to the 3200 m. as well as being a three-time state cross country champion.\n\n\n=== Brigham Young University ===\nBecause she competed at the 2A level in high school, a classification reserved for smaller schools, Camp-Bennett lacked the competition to run faster times to facilitate increased attention to be recruited. However, BYU women's track and field coach, Patrick Shane gave her an opportunity, citing her impressive range from the 400 m up to cross country.\n\n\n==== 2017 ====\nIn fall 2016, Camp-Bennett enrolled at BYU and joined the Cougars track and field and cross country teams, making her Cougar debut during the 2017 track season. That year, she would go on to set a personal best of 2:08.18 and finish sixth at the USATF U20 Outdoor Championships in the 800 m, as well as qualify for the NCAA West Preliminary Round over 1500 m,\n\n\n==== 2018 ====\nThe following year, 2018, competing in the 1500 m at the NCAA West Prelims, she finished just one spot out of qualifying for the NCAA Championships, but set a 4:18.08 personal best in the process.\n\n\n==== 2019 ====\nCompeting at her first national champinship in 2019, Camp-Bennett competed alongside Brenna Porter, Lauren Ellsworth, and Erica Birk in the DMR at the NCAA Indoor Championships. With Camp running the leadoff 1200 m leg, they placed second.\nDuring the outdoor season, Camp-Bennett qualified for her first NCAA Outdoor Championships competing in the 800 m, after setting a personal best of 2:03.69 at the West Prelims. At the NCAA Championships in Austin, she qualified for the final, placing eighth.\n\n\n==== 2021 ====\nIn Mach 2021, Camp-Bennett finished eleventh at the postponed 2020 NCAA Cross Country Championships, leading the BYU women to a national title. On the track, she qualified in both the 800 m and 1500 m for the NCAA Outdoor Championships in Eugene, Oregon. She didn't qualify for the final in the 800 m, but in the 1500 m she upset the field to take the win in a personal best and BYU school record of 4:08.53.\nJust one week after her NCAA victory, she competed in the 1500 m at the US Olympic Trials, advancing to the semi-finals before being eliminated.\nCamp-Bennett's final collegiate race came at the 2021 NCAA Cross Country Championships, in Tallahassee, Florida, where she placed 12th overall as part of the second place BYU women's team.\n\n\n=== Professional ===\n\n\n==== 2022 ====\nIn January 2022, Camp-Bennett signed a professional contract with Adidas, choosing to remain with her BYU coach, Diljeet Taylor. She made her pro debut at the 2022 Millrose Games, placing eleventh in the Wanamaker Mile. Outdoors, she concentrated on the 800 m, running a personal best of 2:00.60 at the Portland Track Festival and reaching the semi-finals of the USA Outdoor Championships.\n\n\n==== 2023 ====\nIn 2023, she shifted focus to the 1500 m, running just one 800 m all year. She failed to reach the 1500 m final at the USA Outdoor Championships, but ran a personal best of 4:04.99 for third at the Ed Murphy Classic in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n\n==== 2024 ====\nIn February 2024, she ran a mile personal best of 4:26.95 to take eleventh at the Millrose Games and the following week placed third behind Nikki Hiltz and Emily Mackay over 1500 m at the USA Indoor Championships.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCamp-Bennett is the daughter of Carl and Kristine Camp and was raised in the town of Fillmore, Utah, a town of just 2,500 people. She has seven siblings: Katie, Josh, Mandee, Nathan, Jaren, Audrey and Kara and majored in Recreation Management at BYU.\nIn 2019, she married Kieran Bennett at the Payson Utah Temple. She and her husband are members of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\n== Competition record ==\n\n\n=== NCAA Championships ===\n\n\n=== USA Championships ===\n\n\n== References ==",

It was an adaptation of a 1902 American play by Ramsay Morris that relocated the action to Australia.\nThe Australian version debuted in 1913 from the Bert Bailey Company.\nThe original American play had been based on the hymn The Ninety and Nine] which had been, in its own turn, inspired by Luke 15:7. This play was filmed in 1922 as The Ninety and Nine.\nThe Sydney Morning Herald said \"it was good, clean, wholesome melodrama; and if it lacked -the pistol play and slaughter ordinarily associated with these productions, it made ample amends by its fidelity to life, a strong love motif, and the self-sacrifice of a woman, which had its ultimate reward in the redemption of the prodigal.\"\nThe Sun said it was done with \"sound, common sense, mixed with mirth\".\nThe Sunday Times said \"The play shows no brilliancy of dialogue or particular ingenuity in the manner in which its situations are devised, several of these, in fact, beiag absolutely banal in their obvious\nstriving for theatrical effect. The chief excuse for its 'raison d'etre' appears to be the preaching of a rather tedious sermon, and the proving of the somewhat obvious axiom that the love of a bad woman debases, while that of a good woman elevates.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Ninety and Nine at Ausstage",

Called Handelskammeret for short, the group portrait was commissioned by the Danish Chamber of Commerce to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1895 painting From Copenhagen Stock Exchange by Peder Severin Krøyer. Critics have noted the figures in the painting have oddly proportioned heads and hands relative to their bodies. The subjects, seated in chairs designed by Kaare Klint, were assembled in the chairman's office for the 1995 painting, while the original was set in the Børssal room. \nDet danske handelskammer komite og adm. direktør 1995 was one of the artworks rescued from the catastrophic Børsen fire in Copenhagen in April 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Healthy Babies Are Happy Babies: A Complete Handbook for Modern Mothers was a popular childcare manual by American pediatrician Josephine Kenyon first published by Little, Brown and Company in 1934.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe book belonged to a genre of childcare manuals pioneered by Luther Emmett Holt in 1894 with The Care and Feeding of Children. The book's popularity reflected Kenyon's appeal and perceived authority as both a mother and a physician. Over the course of its five revisions (the final two co-authored with her daughter Ruth Kenyon Russell) her advice moved from emphasizing rigid schedules to encouraging \"on-demand\" scheduling based on the child. The child's healthy emotional development was emphasized, as was the importance of the pre- and postnatal health of the mother.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKenyon's book was very popular, undergoing nineteen printings in the United States and five translations abroad. The book was widely praised for its practical advice and appeal to both mothers and physicians. Hazel Corbin, general director of the Maternity Center Association, enthusiastically endorsed the book, telling new mothers that \"the soundest advice I can give you on baby care is to get a copy of that book.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Deborah (née Morris) Franklin (September 15, 1736 – September 23, 1787) and John Franklin (April 27, 1732 – August 29, 1801) were colonial patriots who assisted prisoners of war in Province of New York during the American Revolutionary War. Deborah helped patriot prisoners held at the New York City Hall, the Battery, and sugar houses. She and her son rowed a boat out to the prison ships in the New York Harbor at night to deliver food and other necessary supplies. She was banished from New York by British Commander Henry Clinton in 1780 for her aid. The following year, John accepted the position of Agent for Prisons in New York, serving under George Washington, but Clinton objected to John taking the position.\nBeginning in 1775, John served on the Committee of One Hundred and the Provincial Congress.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nDeborah Morris, born September 15, 1736, was a daughter of Sarah (née Powell) and Anthony Morris IV. In 1752, Deborah inherited a house in Philadelphia at 135 Pine Street from Samuel Powell. Major Anthony Morris died at the Battle of Princeton (January 3, 1777).\nDeborah married John Franklin on July 8, 1756, in Philadelphia. The son of Mary (née Pearsall) and Thomas Franklin, John was born on April 27, 1732. His siblings, born between 1727 and 1740 were Walter, Sarah, Thomas, Mary, Samuel, and James. Their marriage was an alliance of two aristocratic families, and an example of marriages between a family from Philadelphia, the Morris family, and the Franklins from New York.\n\nThe couple attended the Philadelphia Monthly Meeting. Between 1757 and 1773, Deborah and John had eight children, Sarah, Mary, Thomas, Phoebe, Elizabeth, Anthony, Rebecca, and Walter. By 1779, the Franklins lived near the \"New Slip\" in the shipyards (west-northwest of Wallabout Bay in New York Harbor).\n\n\n== Franklin brothers ==\nJohn was a successful merchant, including wine, and he owned ships and operated a shipping business. John and his brother Walter were particularly well known as wealthy, community-serving Quakers of New York. Like his brother, Walter was elected to the Committee of One Hundred on May 1, 1775, to manage conflict between the British and the colonists in New York. He was a partner of the international trading firm, Franklin, Robinson & Company as well as a member of the Provincial Congress. Brother Samuel was a wealthy banker. \n\n\n== American Revolution ==\nIn 1775, John was elected as a member of New York's first Provincial Congress and sat on the Committee of One Hundred.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Deborah, John, and their son Anthony, born in 1768, provided care for patriot soldiers who were taken as prisoners of war by the British Army and held captive in prison ships in New York Harbor. The men on the ships were starving and Deborah and her son rowed out in a boat to deliver food and \"necessities\" to the prison ships off Blackwell Island (now Roosevelt Island). Elizabeth Burgin, a neighbor, provided food to prisoners and helped more than 200 patriots escape from the prison ships.\nThe British Army allowed women to provide aid to a man that they knew, but women who provided helped a number of men were looked on with suspicion. Deborah provided aid to men in sugar houses, prisons at City Hall and the Battery, as well as prison ships. British Commander Henry Clinton said that he was \"no longer able to hear or to bear the daily account of her contributing with unbounded liberality to the relief of her fellow-citizens, banished her, without regard to her station, her sex, or the inclemency of the season, from the city, by which act of cruelty, she became deprived the use of her feet.\" He banished her from the city on November 21, 1780, \"for her patriotism and kindness to the prisoners\". She went to Philadelphia on horseback. The experience left her with frost-bitten feet and thereafter in poor health. Deborah's father died in 1780 and she inherited a brick building at Walnut and Front Streets along the Delaware River, near the Morris Wharf. \nIn December 1780, General George Washington offered John the position of Agent to the Prisoners, with the caveat that Henry Clinton would allow him to return to New York. On January 4, 1781, Franklin wrote to Washington that he accepted the position that would bring him back to the city that Deborah was banished from, but a position that he considered important. Washington wrote Franklin on February 14, 1781, stating that Clinton objected to John holding the position in New York.\nNevertheless, Deborah stayed in Philadelphia and looked after their pre-teen son, Tommy. The family lived together in New York by 1783. Deborah remained there until her death.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\nDeborah died on September 23, 1787, when John was in transit from St. Petersburg. She was interred at the Friend's Burying Ground in Philadelphia. Congress reportedly adjourned to attend Deborah's funeral. The Daughters of the American Revolution planted a tree and installed a marker at the Gracie Mansion garden in New York City in her memory in 1928.\nOn May 13, 1789, John married Letitia Townsend Underhill, the widow of Benjamin Underhill and daughter of Sylvanus Townsend. John died on August 29, 1801. Business letters that John wrote to his brothers-in-law, Samuel and Israel Morris, are held in the William Henry Russell collection of Morris family papers at Haley Museum and Library Archives, Wilmington, Delaware.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMoon, Robert Charles (1898).

        "content": "Swainsona pedunculata is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is endemic to inland areas of Western Australia. It is a small, ascending annual herb with imparipinnate leaves with 3 to 7 narrowly elliptic or lance-shaped leaflets, and racemes of 2 to 3 purple flowers.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSwainsona pedunculata is an annual herb up to 20 cm (7.9 in) high with strongly ribbed and hairy stems. Its leaves are imparipinnate, less than 50 mm (2.0 in) long on a long petiole, with 3 to 7, usually 5 narrowly elliptic or lance-shaped leaflets, the lower leaflets 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long and 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) wide. There is a tapering linear stipule often 5 mm (0.20 in) long at the base of the petiole. The flowers are arranged in racemes with 2 to 3 flowers on a peduncle about 0.5 mm (0.020 in) long, each flower 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) long on a pedicel 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base, forming a tube about 2 mm (0.079 in) long, the sepal lobes about twice as long as the tube. The petals are purple, the standard petal about 15 mm (0.59 in) long and wide, the wings 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) long, and the keel about 10 mm (0.39 in) long and 5 mm (0.20 in) long and 1.0–1.5 mm (0.039–0.059 in) deep. The fruit is about 25 mm (0.98 in) long and 3 mm (0.12 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nSwainsona pedunculata was first formally described in 1948 by Alma Theodora Lee in Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium, from specimens collected by Charles Gardner in the Kennedy Range in 1941. The specific epithet (pedunculata) means \"pedunculate\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of pea grows in rocky or stony places in the Carnarvon, Gascoyne and Murchison bioregions of inland Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Palazzo Maffei is an Renaissance-style aristocratic palace located on Via Giacomo Matteotti #35 in central Volterra, province of Pisa, region of Tuscany, Italy. While initially commissioned by the Bishop Mario Maffei (1463–1537) who had been secretary to Popes Eugene IV and Pius II. Mario was the brother of Raffaele Maffei, who also resided, along with his library, in this palace while in Volterra. The palace had been completed by 1527. Initially the palace facade had an exterior frescoed facade with a depiction of a Roman trimph by Daniele Ricciarelli.\nHowever the palace has had a number of owners since then, and the interiors have had multiple refurbishments. The palace is also known for the other owners as the Palazzo Ruggieri, Ruggieri Buzzaglia. It was owned by the  Leoncini circa 1840. When Mario Guarnacci purchased the palace in the late 18th-century he installed a museum of his Etruscan collection in the ground floor; at his death in 1785 the collection was moved to the Palazzo dei Priori. The street in front was once called Via Guidi, and changed to Giacomo Matteotti after the Second World War, to commemorate the Socialist politician murdered in 1924 by Fascists.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Onsen Nozokimi Daisakusen is a rhythm video game published by Atlus on July 2, 2008, as part of a promotion for their then-upcoming role-playing video game Persona 4. An Adobe Flash game, it is played through the web browser on the official Japanese Persona 4 website.\nThe minigame involves the player clicking to the beat of the music to spy on the Persona 4 character Chie Satonaka in the women's side of an onsen hot-spring bath, through a hole in the middle partition. The game took inspiration from how the player visits a bath in Persona 4, but its scenario is otherwise not connected to Persona 4's. The game was popular, but saw mixed reception: some were baffled by the concept and the game's existence, while some enjoyed it.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nOnsen Nozokimi Daisakusen is a rhythm minigame in which the player, located on the men's side of an open-air onsen hot-spring bath, tries to look into the women's side through a hole in the middle partition to spy on the Persona 4 character Chie Satonaka while she is bathing, while avoiding getting caught.\nTo do so, the player must repeatedly click with the mouse on the hole to the beat of the music, in double time, to fill up a heart gauge. They have to avoid clicking too rapidly, which results in Chie noticing them and calling them out on being a pervert; but if they on the other hand click too slowly, the fifteen-second timer will run out, and they lose their chance to look any further. Completing the game earns the player illustrations of Chie bathing, and the option to play through a second challenge where they receive an illustration of Chie bathing with Yukiko Amagi, another Persona 4 character.\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nOnsen Nozokimi Daisakusen was developed in Adobe Flash, and took inspiration from a sequence where the player visits a bath in Persona 4, although the scenario is otherwise not connected to Persona 4's plot. Siliconera described it as part of a trend of Japanese video games having Flash-based demos, while noting that Onsen Nozokimi Daisakusen does not actually act as a demo.\nThe game was published by Atlus on July 2, 2008, as a browser game playable on the official Japanese Persona 4 website, released as part of a promotion for the Japanese release of Persona 4 the following week, together with wallpapers and new trailers. In 2015, Atlus released Hanate Wotagei! Rise no Dance Battle, another browser game with similar clicking gameplay but different theming, to promote their rhythm game Persona 4: Dancing All Night.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOnsen Nozokimi Daisakusen was popular and well liked, according to NLab, who also noted that their review of it was their most-read article of the week. Hayato Ikeya, writing for the same site, found the game shocking as a long-time fan of Persona, considering it uncharacteristic for the series; despite his initial reservations, Ikeya found the game fun and exciting, and enjoyed the ending. GameSpark merely expressed bafflement at the game's existence when summarizing the domestic game industry news of the week.\nWataru Katou, another NLab writer, described the game's peeping conceit as \"a foolish male mentality\" and as something that would be illegal to do in reality, but said that he understood the appeal of wanting to see something when you are forbidden from doing so. Wired called it perverted but sexy, and something to tide Persona fans over while waiting for Persona 4, describing the gameplay as simple but hard to master, and were themselves unable to finish the game; New Akiba recommended those who do not want to complete the game to instead watch a video playthrough. Wired described the sequence where Chie notices the player as \"[verging] on insane\"; Ikeya said that he and his colleagues found the sequence more exciting than the rewards for winning.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website at the Wayback Machine (archived 2008-09-12) (in Japanese)",

        "content": "Alfonso Aparicio Gutiérrez de la Fuente (14 August 1919 – 1 February 1999) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Atlético Madrid. With them, he won four La Liga titles in 1939–40, 1940–41, 1949–50, and 1950–51, thus being the player in the club's history who has won the most league titles. He also played 8 times with the Spanish national team between 1945 and 1949.\nAfter retiring, he became a manager and, for a long time, field delegate of Atlético Madrid.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAparicio was born in Santander, Cantabria, on 14 August 1919. At the age of eight he witnessed his first match, and since then he has not missed a single match played by Racing, the main team from his native Santander. At the Colegio de los Jesuitas in Orduña, he met and played with Lucio del Álamo, who would later come to play for Athletic Bilbao. Like so many other young people from Santander, he played football on the beach of Sardinero or under the discipline of very modest local societies, such as Daring Club, Magdalena, and Juventud Sport.\nHis passion for the sport was such that at Unión Juventud de Santander, he even paid to play, but his sint there was cut short by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, with the then 17-year-old Aparicio enlisting as a volunteer in Aviation Corps. He was enrolled as a replacement soldier in 1940 in the Automobile Regiment until 20 May 1942, when he was discharged.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Club Aviación Nacional ===\nTwo years later, in the middle of the war, Aparicio was transferred to Zaragoza, where he met Ensign Francisco Samalanca, who was recruiting men for the project of forming a football team for the soldiers to entertain themselves on their days off: the Club Aviación Nacional. Once the conflict was over, Atlético Madrid avoided disappearance by merging with Club Aviación, where Aparicio had been playing since its formation in 1937. In this way he became a First Division footballer when the championships resumed.\nAparicio quickly established himself as an undisputed starter under coach Ricardo Zamora, who placed him as a central defender, making him the first football player in Spain to play in that specific position. He formed a great defensive partnership with José Mesa, one of the most solid in the club's history, which played a crucial role in Athletic's historic 1939–40 season, in which the club won the 1939 Campeonato Mancomunado Centro and the 1939–40 La Liga. He later formed a defensive trio with José Luis Riera and Alfonso Silva, which went down in history both at Atlético and in Spanish football as the so-called \"Iron Curtain\".\n\n\n=== Atlético Madrid ===\nAparicio helped Athletic win the 1941–47 FEF President Cup, the longest tournament in the history of Spanish football, playing in all of Athletic's five matches in 1941 and also in the postponed match against Valencia CF in 1947, in which he kept a cleansheet in a 4–0 win, thus being the only Athletic player to feature on both phases of the tournament, although Valencia also had four survivors Juan Ramón, Vicente Asensi, Amadeo, and Mundo. The trophy was presented by Armando Muñoz Calero, the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, who handed the cup to Aparicio, Atlético's team captain. In 1942, due to a rebellion with his club over financial disagreements, Aparicio was on the verge of joining Rayo Cantabria, a mountain team where his brothers Manuel, José, and Ángel played, the latter as a goalkeeper. When Spanish football adopted the WM tactic (3-2-2-3 scheme), he became the first colchonero central defender, as well as one of the first in Spanish football.\nAparicio remained at Atlético for a total of twelve seasons, in which he managed to win the League champion title four times in 1939–40, 1940–41, 1949–50, and 1950–51, and two predecessor titles of the current Supercopa de España: the Copa de los Campeones de España in 1940 and the Copa Eva Duarte in 1951. With four league titles, he is the player with the most leagues in the history of Atlético de Madrid. In total, Aparicio played 259 games with Atlético Madrid, including 213 in the League and 46 in the Copa del Rey, scoring four goals (three in the League).\nAt the end of the 1951–52 season, Aparicio accepted an offer from Boavista F.C., a Portuguese team where he scored seven goals in three games before retiring as a player. He then made his debut as a coach, incorporating the Spanish footballers Pin and Roberto Yurrita, a position that he also held for Levante UD in the Segunda División in 1959–60, and then Rayo Vallecano and Atlético Baleares between 1960 and 1962.\nAfter returning to Madrid, he returned to Atlético, occupying the honorable position of Field Delegate until his retirement, which materialized in the mid-1980s.\n\n\n=== International career ===\nAparicio made his international debut for the Spanish national team in a friendly match against Portugal on 11 March 1945, starting in a 2–2 draw. He went on to earn a total of eight international caps for Spain between 1945 and 1949, all in friendlies and four of whom against Portugal, settling a bitter duel with the Portuguese striker Fernando Peyroteo, ending with a balance of 3 wins, 3 draws, and 2 losses.\nHis training sessions with the national team were very intense and competitive, and Aparicio recalled years later his fights with players like Telmo Zarra, but his respect and admiration went to players like Pahiño, whose skills challenged even a defender as solid as him.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAparicio died in Madrid on 1 February 1999, at the age of 79.\nFuture footballers like Miguel González, Paco Gento, and even a young Vicente Calderón had him as their first idol. The sticker of Alfonso Aparicio became the most sought-after stickers of Atlético Madrid by children in the post-war period.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nClub Aviación Nacional\nLa Liga: 1939–40, 1940–41\nCopa de los Campeones de España: 1940\nAtlético Madrid\nLa Liga: 1949–50, 1950–51\nCopa Eva Duarte: 1951\n\n\n== References ==",

Pinar Toprak, with whom Aguilera previously collaborated on The Xperience residency in 2019, was also a co-producer.\n\"Learning to Fly\" is a pop music ballad played on the piano. The performer sings: \"Sometimes you feel lonely - that's when you learn how to find strength within yourself. (...) You must learn to fall before you fly up. You have to leave the ground before you touch the sky.”\n\"Learning to Fly\" is  Aguilera's first English-language song since her 2020 songs \"Loyal Brave True\" and \"Reflection\" from the Disney film Mulan. Cal Brunker, animation director of PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie, said of the soundtrack: \"When approaching the subject of these songs,  we always start with the artist, looking at it from the perspective of an emotional story. Take Christina Aguilera's song for example - there's a really intense moment about Skye's story in the film, and Aguilera gives a heartwarming display of her vocal skills.\"\nThe premiere of the ballad \"Learning to Fly\" in streaming took place on September 22, 2023. Promotion of the single after its premiere was impossible due to the strike of the SAG-AFTRA organization (to which Aguilera belongs).\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe recording was positively assessed by music critics. A review in Variety called \"Learning to Fly\" a \"tear-jerking ballad\" that fits well with \"breathtaking, cinematic animation\". The editor of That Grape Juice stated that with the ballad, Aguilera \"sings an anthem of hope, inspiration and uplift\". Dom Fisher, writing for Geek Vibes Nation, appreciated the emotional message of the recording, stating that \"it has much more impact than in theory it should\". The Toya'z World website hailed \"Learning to Fly\" as a power ballad whose performer \"proves that she can still sing and sound beautiful.\" The review also praised the song for its \"restrained, composed vocals\" and \"soaring\" piano melody. Kyle McGrath, a journalist for Lilithia, praised PAW Patrol 2 for its \"great soundtrack\", including Aguilera's song.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nOn September 22, 2023, a promotional lyric video appeared online. It premiered on Nick Jr. on YouTube. The clip shows scenes from the animated film Paw Patrol 2.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nWriting – Christina Aguilera, Jeremy Silver Abraham\nProducing – Aguilera, Jeremy Silver Abraham, Pinar Toprak\nMixing – Manny Marroquin\nOrchestral arrangement – Pinar Toprak\nA&R – Nicelle Richards\nExecutive production – SALXCO\nMusic supervision – Trygge Toven, Format Entertainment; co-author Shie Rozow\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

This caused Harrison to abuse them from the stage at the end of the performance, saying he had never seen anything like it in a twenty five-year career, and asking why they were not at the war front.\nHarrison died a few months later.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe Argus said while the play \"certainly has defects merits are much more pronounced than faults and the unfavourable reception on Saturday evening is no indication of the standard of the play.\"\nThe Sydney Referee said the play \"requires a little pruning where it is inclined to drag\" but felt it \"was not intrinsically a poor play, and there was no need to go the extent they did towards actors and actresses.\"\nThe Herald called it \"exceedingly dull\".\nAnother critic said the play became \"duller and duller\".\nThe Sun said \"we have patiently sat through many worse plays.\"\nThe Bulletin said \"there ss no joy of action, wealth of. incident nor force of characterisation.\"\n\n\n== Premise ==\nInhabitants try to revive the fortunes of a small town by looking for a gold reef.\n\n\n== References ==",

The incident took place at the Meilong Expressway (Meidagao Section) in the direction of Fujian, approximately 900 meters from K11 in Cha'yang Town, Dabu County, Meizhou City, Guangdong Province, China.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Road Section ===\nThe Meilong Expressway is a highway connecting Meijiang District with Dabu County in Meizhou City, Guangdong Province. The section where the accident occurred is part of the second phase and the eastern extension line of the Meilong Expressway, which opened to traffic on December 31, 2014. Both the project construction and operation are managed by companies under the Guangdong Communications Group. The operational management company, Guangdong Dachao Expressway Co., Ltd., has been involved in multiple contractual disputes.\nOn April 1, 2023, the Meilong Expressway experienced a collapse due to heavy rain, resulting in the interruption of traffic in both directions. There were no casualties, and the full line was restored to traffic by 24:00 on May 9.\n\n\n=== Weather ===\nPrior to the accident, Guangdong had been experiencing heavy rainfall. On that day, many areas of Guangdong issued meteorological disaster warnings. As of 8:19 a.m. on May 1, there were 41 rainstorm warnings, 48 thunderstorm and gale warnings, and 5 orange hail warnings in effect province-wide.\nIn April, Meizhou experienced multiple rounds of heavy rainfall, surpassing historical records. From April 1 to April 30, Dabu County received 628.2 millimeters of rainfall, which was 2.75 times higher than the average of 228.4 millimeters. Meteorological monitoring showed that from 8:00 a.m. on April 30 to 8:00 a.m. on May 1, Dabu County experienced heavy rain, with an average rainfall of 48.9 millimeters and a maximum of 66.1 millimeters.\nA notice from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Transportation on April 30 stated that due to continuous heavy rainfall, some highways and national and provincial roads in Guangdong were damaged.\n\n\n== Casualties ==\nThe collapsed section of the road was approximately 17.9 meters long with an area of approximately 184.3 square meters.\nAs of 2:00 p.m. on May 2, 23 vehicles were found trapped, resulting in 48 deaths and 30 injuries. Most vehicles were buried in mud, and some vehicles caught fire. Of the 30 injured, most suffered from bone injuries, head trauma, and lung contusions. Twenty-eight were treated at Meizhou People's Hospital, and two were hospitalized at Dabu County People's Hospital.\n\n\n== Cause ==\nThe specific cause is under investigation, with preliminary speculation suggesting that it may be related to geological structure, water erosion, construction quality, and other factors.\n\n\n== Response ==\nOn May 1, the Guangdong Provincial and Meizhou Municipal governments established a command headquarters for the accident rescue operation. More than 500 personnel from the public security, emergency response, fire, health, transportation, and mine rescue teams were mobilized for on-site rescue. Huang Kunming, Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary of Guangdong Province, made instructions and arrangements, convening two video dispatch meetings. Wang Weizhong, Governor of Guangdong Province, rushed to the disaster site to direct on-site emergency response work.\nOn May 2, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping, issued \"important instructions,\" urging all-out efforts to rescue the injured, promptly identify and dispose of hidden risks, ensure the safety of people's lives and property, and maintain social stability. Premier of the People's Republic of China Li Qiang, made instructions. The Ministry of Emergency Management and the Ministry of Transport dispatched working groups to the scene to guide rescue work.\nThe Office of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management organized joint consultations with the China Meteorological Administration, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Natural Resources, and the Ministry of Transport to study and deploy flood and disaster relief work in key areas such as South China, Jiangnan, and Northeast China during the May Day holiday.

        "content": "Erythranthe diffusa, also known as Palomar monkeyflower, is a species of plant native to North America. This plant is endemic to the Californias, and is considered a rare plant due to its limited range. E. diffusa grows up to 8 in (20 cm) in height, and produces purple, pink, and yellow flowers. It prefers to grow in gravelly or sandy soil in chaparral or a low-elevation coniferous habitat. E. diffusa has been observed in Los Angeles County, Orange County, Riverside County, San Diego County, Santa Clara County, and Baja California. The Palomar monkeyflower is threatened by recreational activities and real estate development of its preferred wild habitat.\n\n\n== References ==",

The play was presented by William Anderson.\nIt was one of a series of popular early Australian written plays.\nThe play concerned a hypothetical war between Germany and Britain and how it might affect Australia, with an emphasis on the role to be played by the boy scouts. The play was written in two weeks in honour of Baden Powell.\nThe Bulletin said the play \"might have been hurled together in two  days. Its outstanding defect is that it is  without a redeeming feature. A more dull,  futile, amorphous and utterly absurd dra- matic misdemeanor the present benevolently  disposed critic has not encountered. The  idea appears to be to picture a German in-vasion of Australia; but if it is informed that the play was written with the object of show-ing the effects of pre-Raphaelism upon the cow industry this paper will decline to be  surprised. Anyhow, the nebulous suggestion of a plot disappears from view after the first act. \"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jaña Qazaqstan (Kazakh: Жаңа Қазақстан, lit. 'New Kazakhstan') was a parliamentary group in the Mäjilis existing during the 7th convocation from 2022 to 2023. Its formation was a response to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's reform initiatives following the January Events.\nThe Jaña Qazaqstan group advocated for accountability regarding the January Events, pushed for the renaming of the Kazakh capital back to Astana, and spearheaded efforts to repeal legislation granting immunity to former president Nursultan Nazarbayev, engaging in constructive dialogue with the government and actively participating in the development of essential legislative proposals in the Mäjilis. Additionally, the group established channels for collaboration with non-profit organizations and activists.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing the January Events, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev introduced the political concept of New Kazakhstan in his subsequent speech to the parliament. This vision aimed to signal a shift towards societal renewal and progressive reforms in Kazakhstan. Consequently, the name Jaña Qazaqstan, meaning \"New Kazakhstan\" in Kazakh, was established as parliamentary group consisting of 31 deputies in the lower house Mäjilis on 9 February 2022, aligning closely with President Tokayev's vision. According to deputy Edil Jañbyrşin, the Jaña Qazaqstan group would be involved in addressing pressing issues by actively raising current concerns, collaborating closely with the government, contributing to the development of essential legislation, and working closely with non-profit organizations and activists, and implementing the reforms outlined by Tokayev.\nOn 10 February 2022, during a press conference, it was announced that the parliamentary group would include three subgroups led by co-chairs, deputies Edil Jañbyrşin, heading the first subgroup focusing on agriculture, economics, and ecology; Aidos Sarym, overseeing the subgroup on human rights, security, and legal reform; and Natalia Dementyeva, leading the subgroup on socio-cultural development and youth. From there, Sarym also rejected the idea of forming Jana Qazaqstan group as a separate political party or a faction split within the ruling Nur Otan party. Instead, he advocated for reforming Nur Otan, highlighting the party's extensive presence with branches in every village and its significant influence as a \"great force\".\nThe Jaña Qazaqstan group in the Mäjilis has emphasized various projects during its tenure, notably requesting detailed progress reports from the Prosecutor General's Office regarding investigations into crimes committed during the January Events of 2022.\nIn September 2022, the parliamentary group supported President Tokayev's proposal to change the presidential term from five years to a non-renewable seven-year term, contingent upon its adoption prior to the snap presidential election of 2022. Additionally, the Jaña Qazaqstan group proposed the initiative to rename the capital from Nur-Sultan back to Astana. Subsequently, the constitutional amendments were unanimously ratified by the Mäjilis deputies and signed into law by Tokayev.\nIn October 2022, the Jaña Qazaqstan deputies lodged a complaint with Chief Prosecutor General Berik Asylov against businessman Ramil Mukhoryapov for his derogatory remarks about the Kazakh language, urging legal action to address the issue, which they perceived as a provocation harming the country's interests.\nDuring the Jaña Qazaqstan group meeting on 5 January 2023 with the leadership of Samruk-Kazyna, with discussions focused on proposals including support for publishing houses creating domestic Kazakh language content, implementation of projects aiding parents of children with special needs, singles, orphans, and disabled children, measures to support ethnic Kazakh diaspora abroad, and fostering an inclusive environment, among others.\nIn January 2023, the parliamentary group challenged the status of the Law \"On the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan - Elbasy\" which granted immunity former president Nursultan Nazarbayev at the Constitutional Court of Kazakhstan following its repeal in the 2022 referendum, resulting in a ruling favoring the Jaña Qazaqstan group deputies, with the legislation officially repealed by the Parliament.\nThe Jaña Qazaqstan group disbanded following the dissolution of the Mäjilis of the 7th Parliament of Kazakhstan on 19 January 2023, as part of President Tokayev's reforms and the broader political transition within Kazakhstan, leading to the election of new deputies and the formation of the composition of the 8th Parliament of Kazakhstan.\n\n\n== Deputy group chairs ==\n\n\n== Membership ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He spent his childhood in England, where he had been sent with his siblings to live with an uncle, while their parents remained in China until after the war. A wing-forward, Curtis played his rugby with London Irish and Oxford University, while winning three Ireland caps in the 1950 Five Nations, against France, England and Scotland.\nCurtis immigrated to Rhodesia. His son David was born there and played rugby for Ireland in the early 1990s. One of his grandsons (Angus) was an Ulster player and another (Graham) has represented Ireland in rugby sevens.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Ireland national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArthur Curtis at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "John Chandler Kubacki (June 6, 1912 – November 23, 1988) was an American politician who was Mayor of Reading, Pennsylvania, from 1960 to 1964. He was convicted of extorting money from companies that sold parking meters to the city as well as madam from whom he obtained protection money.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKubacki was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, on June 6, 1912. His father, Bernard, was a foreman for the Reading Car Wheel Company. Kubacki graduated from Reading Senior High School in 1930 and Bucknell University in 1934. He was involved in athletics and was captain of the Bucknell boxing team his senior year. In 1935, he became athletic director, teacher, and basketball coach at Wyomissing Polytechnic Institute. He served in the United States Navy during World War II as a physical training officer. After the war, he worked in public relations for a distillery.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1947, Kubacki helped organized and was elected chairman of the Veterans Political Advisory Board, which was created to recruit war veterans to run for political office and lobby for better housing, sports, and recreation facilities in Reading. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Reading school board in 1947 and the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1948. In 1949, Mayor John F. Davis appointed Kubacki to the Mayor's committee on housing. Later that year, Kubacki was elected to the school board. \nIn 1950, Kubacki was elected as a Democrat to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He was an unsuccessful candidate for city comptroller in 1951, but was reelected to the House in 1952 and 1954. He was elected to the Reading city council in 1955 and resigned from the House on December 31 of that year. He also served as the city's director of public safety.\nBy 1958, Kubacki was at odds with members of his own party, including mayor Daniel F. McDevitt. In 1959, he upset McDevitt to win the Democratic nomination for mayor. In the general election, he defeated his former homeroom teacher, J. Edgar Hilgendorf, by 5,603 votes to become mayor of Reading. \nDuring Kubacki's mayoralty, the city began a number of public improvement projects, including downtown commercial redevelopment, renovations to the Reading Regional Airport, and a $4.5 million sewage program, and completed two parking projects. Also under Kubacki, the Reading Police Department started its canine unit and expanded its juvenile department. Kubacki filled boards with loyalists and dismissed longtime Reading Airport Authority executive director Mel Nuss and the director of both the Reading House Authority and Reading Redevelopment Authority, Phil Schmehl.\nIn April 1963, Reading Police Chief Charles S. Wade was indicted on perjury charges. Kubacki chose not to discipline or suspend Wade. On May 21, 1963, Kubacki was upset in the Democratic mayoral primary by Harold L. Guldin.\n\n\n== Criminal charges ==\nIn 1961, as part of United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's war on organized crime, U.S. attorneys Thomas F. McBride and Henry S. Ruth Jr. were assigned to investigate racketeering in Reading and Berks County, Pennsylvania. On July 8, 1963, Kubacki was indicted by a federal grand jury for violations of the Hobbs Act and Travel Act. He was accused of extorting $10,500 from companies selling parking meters. On April 17, 1964, he and his co-defendant, rackets boss Abraham Minker, were convicted on all charges. Kubacki was sentenced to 30 days in prison and fined $5,000. In 1968, Judge Alfred Leopold Luongo dismissed the $4,250 unpaid portion of his fine due to financial hardship.\nOn September 9, 1964, Kubacki, Minker, and Benny Bonanno were charged with extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion for allegedly demanding payoffs from a brothel owner during Kubacki's tenure as mayor. The trio were found guilty on March 22, 1965, after a jury took just one hour to deliberate. They were sentenced to six months to a year in Berks County Prison. On November 16, 1966, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania voted 5 to 2 to grant all three defendants new trials after it found that the trial judge had erred by not allowing defense counsel to examine a tape recording of a statement made by prosecution witness Charles S. Wade and use portions of the statement in cross-examination. At the retrial, the alleged victim, Angeline Martin Wilkerson, refused to testify and the charges were dismissed against all three men.\nOn January 27, 1965, Kubacki was found not guilty of extorting $500 from a dealer who sold the city two police vans.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1968, Kubacki returned to politics as a candidate for his old House seat, but lost in the Democratic primary. In 1977, he suffered a stroke. Kubacki died at his home on November 23, 1988, of natural causes. He was buried in Gethsemane Cemetery in Laureldale, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn June 25, 1939, Kubacki married Mary Stockler. They had two sons – Alan and Joseph. Alan Kubacki is a former teacher and administrator in the Reading School District and was a member of the Reading Housing Authority. Joseph Kubacki is an ophthalmologist who was an associate dean of the Temple University School of Medicine. In 2011, he was convicted of 150 counts of health care fraud, wire fraud and making false statements for billing for patient care that actually was handled by medical residents.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Oddnýjarhnjúkur-Langjökull (Langjökull) volcanic system of Iceland last erupted about 3600 years ago and is associated with current geothermal activity. The area of its central volcano is at present under the second largest ice cap in Iceland.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe volcanic system is located north of Lake Thingvallavatn and its southern lava flows contribute to the floor of the Þingvellir rift valley central to Icelandic cultural history and the fissure system which is up to 20 km (12 mi) wide extends up to 100 km (62 mi) north. The Laugarfjall lava dome on the western side of the Haukadalur valley that houses the Geysir geothermal area with its geysers and other geothermal features is part of the southern fissure swarm. The shield volcano of Skjaldbreiður is prominent to the north of the rift valley with a height of 1,066 m (3,497 ft) and to the north the Langjökull ice cap at 870 km2 (340 sq mi) in area and second in area in Iceland, covers its central volcano of Oddnýjarhnjúkur. The highest point within the Langjökull icecap is to its north east where the Baldjökull part of the ice cap covers a tuya of the same name with a height of 1,435 metres (4,708 ft). The geothermal area of Hveravellir with hot springs, fumaroles and mud pools is to the north east of the central volcano in the northern part of the fissure swarm which is dominated by Kjalhraun at 840 metres (2,760 ft). To the west is the Prestahnúkur volcanic system with the small ice cap of Eiríksjökull 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi) in area, and to the east of Langjökull is the Hofsjökull volcanic system with the large Hofsjökull ice cap and to its south the Kerlingarfjöll volcanic massif. A large tuya Hrútfell with a height of 1,396 m (4,580 ft) is located between Baldjökull and Kerlingarfjöll at the southern end of the Kjölur plateau between the two volcanic systems which is reached by the Kjalvegur road (F35).\n\n\n== Activity ==\nCurrently apart from the geothermal activity already mentioned at Geysir and Hveravellir there have been earthquake swarms to the south-east of the Langjokull glacier and north of Hveravellir. While some of the fairly recently erupted Hallmundarhraun lava flow came from vents immediately adjacent to the north-west boundary of the system these eruptions are now assigned to the Prestahnúkur volcanic system.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nThe Oddnýjarhnjúkur-Langjökull volcanic system is mountainous as it has ice age subglacially erupted tuyas and tindars up to 10 km (6.2 mi) long, with post glaciation lava shields and volcanic fissures with the predominant lava being olivine tholeiite basalt. Only effusive eruptions have been identified. The Oddnýjarhnjúkur central volcano has caldera structures that have at their rim silicic hyaloclastite that formed during the ice age. The oldest deposits are about 800,000 years old.\nThe Skjaldbreiður lava shield has three lava units deposited between 6000 and 9000 years BP, and covers 170 km2 (66 sq mi) with a volume of about 13 km3 (3.1 cu mi). It is sometimes considered a separate volcanic system with the southern fissures having erupted lavas with ages between 10,200 years and the most recent Thjófahraun lava field of the Oddnýjarhnjúkur-Langjökull volcanic system of 3600 years ago.\nThe 7800 years BP Kjalhraun flow to the north-east has a similar area but covers only 11 km3 (2.6 cu mi) with its eastern portion broken up by faulting from the Hofsjökull volcanic system. On the Kjalhraun flow's northern edge is the Hveravellir high-temperature geothermal field with an area of 2.5 km2 (0.97 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Tectonics ===\nAs part of the Western volcanic zone of Iceland which is a receding rift, and the north–western edge of the Hreppar microplate, the Oddnýjarhnjúkur-Langjökull volcanic system does not accommodate currently as much of the mutual movement of the North American Plate and Eurasian Plate as the volcanic zones to its south or east. The Western volcanic zone is an ultra-slow divergent spreading center, spreading at about 7 mm (0.28 in)/year  at the Hengill triple junction at its south and with no spread where the Mid-Iceland belt which is the northern boundary of the Hreppar microplate meets the Western volcanic zone at Langjökull. The closeness of the Iceland hotspot to the east is believed to increase the magma supply.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nLarsen, Guðrún; Guðmundsson, Magnús T.

        "content": "The East Asian countries of Japan and Korea have significant contemporary influence over and cultural similarities with Northeast India, which engages to a significant extent with Korean and Japanese culture and has been receiving infrastructural investment from Japan.\n\n\n== China ==\n\n\n== Japan ==\n\nHistorically, Northeast India and Japan have been connected to some extent through Buddhism; other cultural similarities have existed for millennia, such as in food and through an appreciation for nature. During World War 2, the Japanese military collaborated with the Indian National Army in the region; eventually, the westward expansion of the Japanese Empire was put to a stop in Northeast India in the 1944 Battle of Imphal. Since then, Japan has contributed to the construction of infrastructure in the region. Northeast Indians consume some Japanese cultural products as well, such as anime.\nNortheast India is currently being prioritized by India and Japan as part of Japan's Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy and as part of India's Act East policy, with both countries seeing the region as especially important for creating trading routes due to their collective rejection of China's Belt and Road Initiative. Northeast India, in conjunction with the neighboring BIMSTEC country of Bangladesh, is seen by Japan as an important region in containing China, while India seeks to use its northeastern region to increase engagement with Southeast Asia. The geographical similarities between Northeast India and Japan, as well as India's guarding of its northeast as a sensitive border region that it is unwilling to allow untrusted partner countries to invest in, are other major factors leading to India desiring Japan's involvement in the region.\n\n\n== Korea ==\n\nNortheast India has often felt alienated from the rest of India (sometimes referred to as \"mainland India\"), leading it in recent decades to look towards phenotypically and culturally similar parts of Asia in the east for connection. Part of this alienation is due to local insurgents and others banning Hindi cinema and other potential tools of \"Indianization\" in the region. In this context, Korean culture has become popular in Northeast India, with Korean words becoming increasingly prevalent in the local languages. Korean food has also become increasingly popular at local restaurants. The popularity of Korean culture that emerged in Northeast India has since spread to the rest of India in recent years. One aspect of Korean culture's popularity in Northeast India is its ability to incorporate Christian principles in a non-Western manner, making it more relatable in some ways to Northeast Indian youth than Western culture.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEastern South Asia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Monastery of Love (Das Kloster der Minne) is a Minnerede (courtly love story) or Minneallegorie (courtly love allegory) from the 2nd quarter of the 14th century. The poem consists of up to 1890 rhyming couplets and was probably composed between 1330 and 1350 in southern Germany. The author is unknown.\nThe Monastery of Love is the story of a wanderer who is shown the way to a monastery by a messenger on horseback. In the monastery, whose headmistress is said to be Lady Love herself, he meets an acquaintance who shows him the building and with whom he watches a tournament before leaving the monastery again. Despite repeated requests, he has not met Lady Love in person, as she is only visible through her effect on the inhabitants of the monastery.\nDue to the uncertain chronological classification and the anonymity of the author, The Monastery of Love has repeatedly become the focus of literary scholarship since the 19th century, for which it was of interest until the late 20th century, particularly in terms of its presumed relationship to the rules of the monastery of Ettal. In terms of content, the special feature of the work in comparison to other narrative Minnerede and Minneallegories is that it avoids personifications, meaning, for example, that Lady Love (Frau Minne) does not appear as a woman.\n\n\n== Tradition ==\n\n\n=== Cod. Donaueschingen 104 (\"Liedersaal manuscript\") ===\nThe oldest known manuscript of The Monastery of Love is contained in Cod. Donaueschingen 104. The codex was created around 1433 and is written in Alemannic dialect. The manuscript probably came from Konstanz. The manuscript originally had 269 pages, and The Monastery of Love has a length of 1890 verses. Of all three surviving manuscripts, it is the oldest and most reliable version, which is also the best preserved. The Minnerede has no heading in the Donaueschingen manuscript. The Cod. Donaueschingen 104 is now kept in the Baden State Library.\nJoseph von Laßberg published the Donaueschingen manuscript between 1820 and 1825 under the title Lieder Saal. This is a collection of old German poems from unprinted sources. Laßberg gave the then untitled Minnerede the title The Monastery of Love. According to Laßberg, who considered The Monastery of Love to be the most beautiful work in his collection, Cod. Donaueschingen 104 is also known as the \"Liedersaal manuscript\".\n\n\n=== Codex Dresden M 68 ===\n\nCodex Dresden M 68 comes from Augsburg and was written in 1447 by Peter Grienninger in the East Swabian dialect. The manuscript has a total of 79 pages and contains 35 smaller poetic texts, such as fairy tales, prayers, love letters and Minnereden, including the Minnelehre of Johann von Konstanz. The monastery of Love comprises 1866 verses in this manuscript. Of the surviving manuscripts, Codex Dresden M 68 is the most deficient. It contains numerous individual verses, some of which even impair the meaning, and has surplus plus verses, while at the same time rhyming couplets from the other manuscripts are missing. Peter Grienninger was not always sure of the spelling either: Grienninger gave the Minnerede the title De monte feneris agitur hit, which was corrected to De monte feneris agitur hic (translation: This is about the Venusberg). The manuscript is now kept in the Saxon State and University Library Dresden.\n\n\n=== Cod. Pal. germ. 313 ===\nThe most recent surviving manuscript of The Monastery of Love is kept in the Heidelberg University Library. The Cod. Pal. germ. 313 is 498 pages long and dates from 1478. It was written in the North Alemannic-South Franconian dialect, which is why today the Upper Rhine region is assumed to be the origin of the scribe. The Cod. Pal. germ. 313 contains not only The Monastery of Love, which is preserved on 63 pages and in 1884 verses, but also 55 other Minnereden by Heinrich der Teichner (Knight or servant), Meister Altswert (The old sword, The smock) and Fröschel von Leidnitz (Overheard love conversation), among others. The Minnerede The Monastery of Love is included in Johann von Konstanz's Minnelehre and Hermann von Sachsenheim's Mirror.\n\n\n=== Manuscript relationship ===\nNone of the three paper manuscripts that preserve The Monastery of Love represents the original archetype. On the basis of the known manuscripts, it is possible to reconstruct two branches of The Monastery of Love. The Codex Donaueschingen forms one of the two branches, as it lacks four verses that are contained in both the Codex Dresden M 68 and the Cod. pal. germ. 313. Since both younger manuscripts lack a verse that the Codex Donaueschingen possesses, there must be a common model for these manuscripts that refers to the archetype. Furthermore, Codex Dresden M 68 cannot have served as a model for Cod. pal. germ. 313, because Cod. pal. germ. 313, together with the Donaueschingen manuscript, contains verses that are missing in Codex Dresden M 68. The age of the manuscripts also rules out a copy of Codex Dresden M 68 from Cod. pal. germ. 313.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\n\n=== Walk in the forest ===\nThe first-person narrator goes for a walk in May, leading him into a forest. He admires the flowers, the green treetops and the song of the nightingale and lark. He soon spots a woman on horseback among the trees. He hides from her until her horse is close to where he is hiding and only then reveals himself. He grabs the horse by the bridle and prevents the lady from riding on. Before he lets her go, he wants to know the purpose of her ride alone in the forest. The woman tells him she is traveling as a messenger of the werdi Minne (Lady Love)  who, as a noble queen, has power over all the lands of the earth. The narrator is not yet satisfied with this information and demands to know the purpose of her journey. The rider explains that she is looking for women, knights and servants to join Lady Love. After asking again, the rider reveals further details: a (master) builder has created a unique, huge monastery in which Love lives. Anyone who enters the monastery will have a wonderful life and people from all social classes will go there: kings, dukes, counts, maids, knights and servants. All residents had to abide by a monastery rule according to which they were to be subject to Love. They were allowed to sing, read, make music and dance. \nThe shape and nature of the monastery is unique: it is circular and unimaginably large. ez war kain pferd nie so snel, / das es in ainem gantzen jar / das closter umbe lüffe gar. The monastery has twelve gates, each representing a month. Theoretically, the inhabitants of the monastery therefore have the opportunity to live in their favorite month all the time. The narrator is fascinated by this world and longs to see the Monastery of Love with his own eyes. The rider describes the way to the monastery, which the narrator - choosing the right path at a fork in the road - will enter via the May gate. The narrator is satisfied with the answers and lets the rider move on. After a short time, he arrives at the Monastery of Love.\n\n\n=== Arrival at the monastery ===\nAs he stands in front of the walls of the monastery, a group of men and women move out of the monastery gate into the open and gather for a round dance. They appear to be lovers who, after dancing, sit down in pairs in the shade of the trees in front of the monastery gate. The narrator notices (wedding) rings on numerous fingers and feels miserable. Among the couples are numerous acquaintances from earlier days, but they do not recognize the narrator. Suddenly a bell is rung. A squire announces the arrival of 500 knights and servants who want to hold a tournament with the residents of the monastery. The best knight is promised the crest of a lion with a golden chain as a prize in the spear fight. The best servant is to receive the coat of arms of a leopard with a silver chain. The men return to the monastery to prepare for the tournament.\n\n\n=== Tour through the monastery ===\nAmong the women who stayed behind, the narrator discovers a good acquaintance. She tells him that she has been living in the convent for ten years and, accompanied by a few other women, shows him around the convent: the large courtyard is enclosed by a main building, with a door leading into it from each of the four walls. The building has balconies and bay windows and is made of different-colored, partially openwork marble. The walls shine like mirrors, making the whole building appear incomparably beautiful to the narrator. However, his companion points out that there are many of these buildings in the monastery.\n\nAs the tournament is due to start soon, the other women say goodbye to the narrator. The acquaintance stays with him and talks about the nature of the order. Love rules over all the inhabitants of the monastery, but they are headed by an abbot and an abbess as well as a prior and a prioress. Anyone who fails to abide by the rules of the monastery will be punished. The nature of the punishments is shown during a tour of the monastery prison: a gossiper is tied up with a neck iron. He asks the narrator for bread as he is starving and begs him to ask the abbot for mercy as he has been imprisoned for three years for insulting a woman. The lady accompanying the narrator warns him that he would make himself unpopular if he went to the abbot on this matter. After the narrator has promised her not to stand up for the prisoners, the companion leads him to a braggart lying on old straw tied to a block. Originally he was a noble servant, but he bragged about his love affairs. Mockers, envious, fickle and cowardly people are also in the monastery prison, but the narrator decides to return with his companion to the other women and watch the tournament.\n\n\n=== The tournament ===\nThe narrator and his friend see the monks of the monastery dressed in knight's armor. Shortly afterwards, the monastery's guests arrive at the palace courtyard and the tournament begins. In the course of the tournament, the narrator pretends to be impartial, but at the same time rarely knows who belongs to the guests and who belongs to the monastery inhabitants. At the end of the tournament, the prior is honored as the best knight and the monastery porter as the best servant. Both are again attacked by guests after receiving their prizes. The prior successfully defends himself, but the porter is seriously injured and has to be carried off the field. When the narrator points out to his horrified companion that tournaments have to be brutal in order to win the hearts of women, his acquaintance lectures him: Tournaments primarily only benefited the knight or servant, who could improve his fighting skills in the game and thus make a name for himself. There are certainly some men who only fight for the sake of a woman's favor, but they have misunderstood the real purpose of the tournament. The narrator and his acquaintance talk about the basic layout of the monastery, in which traitors, robbers and usurers have no place. Doch wer sich möcht begeben / und dise regel halten, / der möcht in fröuden alten / und doch da by dienen got. When the narrator finally wishes to see Love in person, he justifies this with reports that Love would wound the body and heart with her arrow and that people would torture themselves as a result. His acquaintance tells him that Love herself is invisible and can only be seen in all her effects among the men and women of the monastery, but the narrator refuses to believe her. When the acquaintance feels mocked by him, he apologizes to her and thanks her for her help. She hints that they could become a couple if she knew him longer. As the guests defeated in the tournament want to come back in 12 days, the acquaintance invites the narrator back to the monastery in 12 days. During this time, the still hesitant man can decide whether he wants to spend the rest of his life in the monastery or not.\n\n\n=== Farewell ===\nThe acquaintance and one of her friends want to take the narrator to the convent gate, but they stop briefly in the acquaintance's room, which is richly decorated and ornate. The narrator feels uncomfortable in the small room. When she shows him her large bed, he wishes he could throw himself on it (with her), but does not dare. The companion, who guesses his thoughts, laughs at him. Together they drink St. John's wine, after which the narrator leaves both women in the room and hurries out of the monastery. He returns to the forest, where the birdsong and the flowers seem insignificant in contrast to the colorful hustle and bustle of the monastery. He longs to return to the monastery and knows that \"lat mich got so lang leben, / ich wil mich in daz closter geben / und wil die regel halten / und in dem closter alten.\"\n\n\n== Genre, literary models and style ==\n\n\n=== Genre ===\nThe Monastery of Love belongs to the literary genre of so-called Minnereden, which was mainly popular in the late Middle Ages and can also be described as a love-allegory.\n\n\n==== Minnerede ====\nThe text is a Minnerede because it treats the topic of courtly love (in Middle High German, Minne) in a didactic or instructive manner for long stretches. This is evident from the plot: the narrator's questions are answered by his companion, followed by counter-questions from the narrator. The course of the plot follows the course of the didactic conversation between the narrator and his lady and between the narrator and the messenger in the forest at the beginning of the plot. However, instructive passages alternate with narrative and descriptive passages (for example during the tournament).\n\n\n==== Love-allegory ====\nWith some reservations, The Monastery of Love can be described as a love-allegory. \"The actual allegory is missing in so far as not only none of the otherwise popular personifications such as honor, shame, stature, dignity, confidence and the like, but also \"love\" herself, the much-mentioned one, does not appear in person.\" The reader's expectations in this regard are instead deliberately deceived in that love is apparently described as a person in the narrator's conversation with the messenger, for example, she is the mistress of the messenger and has gewalt über alli lant; sie ist ain edli künigin. The narrator therefore logically wonders, when he arrives at the monastery and sees the inhabitants dancing, whether Love is perhaps one of the dancing women. He tells his companion that he wants to see Love, and she leads him to the people of the monastery, who are together in harmony. The narrator nevertheless expects to see Love as a person.\n\nich sprach: „liebi fro, sagt an,\nwenn nü kömt die Minne?“\nsi sprach: „hastü nit sinne,\nald wie ist dir beschechen?\nwiltü nit minne sechen\nhie uff diesem theras,\nso frag nach minn nit furbaß!“\nLady Love is therefore only visible in her effects on people, but not physically present. Glier describes the text’s conception of love as a \"rather indirect allegory\". Richter refers to \"an older conception\" that defines Love as a ghostly, invisible being, as is the case, for example, in the didactic poem Die Winsbekin, in which the daughter asks her mother: nu sage mir ob diu Minne lebe / und hie bî uns ûf erde sî / od ob uns in den lüften swebe, to which the mother replies, referring to Ovid, that si vert unsictic als ein geist.\n\nThe monastery building can be interpreted allegorically to some extent. It has twelve gates, each representing a month, thus creating twelve different climatic zones in the interior and vestibule of the monastery. It is circular and also so large that the number of inhabitants is infinite and a horse could not walk around the monastery in a year. Wolfgang Achnitz used this information to make the following calculation:\"If one takes this information literally and generously assumes that a horse in a hurry covers about 60 kilometers a day, depending on its gait, then the circumference of the complex is almost 22,000 kilometers, from which a diameter of about 7,000 kilometers can be calculated. This almost corresponds to the distance from the Arctic Circle to the equator or from Gibraltar in the west to India in the east, i.e. the area of the entire known orbis terrarum of the 14th century.\"\nWolfgang Achnitz 2006The monastery should therefore not be understood as a real building, but rather as an allegorical reference to Love's domain, which is also mentioned in the text itself: sie hat gewalt über alli lant and, with regard to the simultaneously existing seasons, also at all times. The size of the monastery and the climatic peculiarities are mentioned in the work at the beginning, \"but not developed to full vividness\" and no longer play a role in the further course of the plot. For Anke Roeder, The Monastery of Love can therefore be described \"more as a love story than an allegory\".\n\n\n==== Literary models and further impact ====\nThe motif of the allegorical monastery can already be found in medieval Latin poetry, for example in Hugh of Fouilloy's work De claustro animae from 1160. In the third and fourth books of his treatise, the four sides of the monastery of the heavenly Jerusalem stand for the four cardinal virtues.\nAndreas Capellanus' (Andreae Capellani) treatise De amore libri tres was written around 1185, in which a palatium amoris stands in the middle of the world (of the dead). This is a quadrangular palace with four gates. In the east is the god Cupid, who sends out his arrows of love. In the south are the women, who always keep their palace gate open. They are open to love because they are hit directly by Cupid's arrows. In the west, prostitutes wander around outside their palace gates, never turning anyone away, but not being hit by Cupid's arrows. In the north, the gates are locked. The women rejected love during their lifetime and were therefore condemned by Cupid.\nIn its design, The Monastery of Love draws on motifs from Latin poetry, but also links them with stories about the home of the goddess of love, as De monte feneris agitur hic shows with its reference to the Venusberg material. This was used in the form of the \"Minnegrotte\" (love grotto) in Gottfried von Strasbourg's Tristan, for example.\nThe Monastery of Love may have influenced the 1472 work The Secular Monastery. The love allegories attributed to Master Altswert (above all The Treasure of Virtues) also show parallels to the Monastery of Love. \"But otherwise the poem - in contrast to Hadamar von Laber's allegorical love doctrine, which was written around the same time - has hardly had any discernible effect.\"\n\n\n==== Style ====\nThe Monastery of Love is a \"poem written in skillful verse.\" It is written in couplets and the verse structure is flowing. The narrative style is kept simple, with large parts of the text consisting of the narrator's conversation with the messenger of Love and his companion in the monastery. His questions are followed by the companion's explanations or the companion asks questions about the extent to which the narrator agrees with what he sees. For this purpose, formulaic phrases are used, for example, the companion's questions are regularly introduced with lieber gesell, nü sage mir ... or lieber gesell, wie gefellet dir. This structure was seen as a \"convenient means of dividing chapters and structuring, especially in larger descriptive poems\", but was also criticized: \"Little stimulation arises from such mock dialogue.\"\nThe author makes use of rhetorical stylistic devices such as word clusters and parallelisms, but the weakness of the text is the uniformity of expression. Vocabulary of praise, used for example in the description of the monastery or the companion's chamber, is essentially limited to the words \"beautiful\" (schön), \"precious\" (kostlich) and \"rich\" (rich), which are used repeatedly. The description of the tournament is based on the combination of the words \"run\" (rennen) and \"sting\" (stechen). Nevertheless, Laßberg, for example, considered The Monastery of Love to be the most beautiful poem in his Liedersaal, which can be explained, among other things, by the vividness of the narrative: \"Again and again, the opportunity is taken to create something unmistakable through the detailed, imaginative shaping of a scene or situation, not just to vary topoi once again.\" In addition, Schaus emphasizes the authenticity of the descriptions and Glier the \"unusually light and varied\" conversations.\n\n\n== Author's question and chronological classification ==\nAs both the author and the date of composition are not clear from the work itself, the Minnerede The Monastery of Love offers room for interpretation and speculation. Since the \"rediscovery\" of the work in the course of its publication by Joseph von Laßberg, there have been repeated attempts to determine the time of composition and the author more precisely.\n\n\n=== League of Lions ===\nIn 1895, Georg Richter dated the work to the second half of the 14th century. He saw this as proven above all by the tournament prizes, which included a lion crest with a golden chain for the best knight and a leopard with a silver chain for the best servant.[38] Richter saw this as a parallel to the League of Lions, which was founded in 1379. Every knight had to wear a golden lion and every servant a silver lion as a badge; according to a chronicle by Jakob Twinger von Königshofen from Strasbourg, it was supposed to have been either a lion or a panther made of gold or silver. A lion on a chain would also have been regarded in research as a badge of the lion society. Richter therefore considered the date of origin of the Minnerede to be after 1379, a view that is no longer shared in today's research. On the one hand, the secular knightly society of the Order of the Lion left no traces in the political sphere of the spiritual knightly order of the Monastery of Minne; on the other hand, the lion and panther are common medieval heraldic animals, so that a mere similarity of the society's insignia cannot be an indication of dependence.\n\n\n=== Lament for a Noble Duchess ===\nIn Laßberg's Liedersaal, The Monastery of Love is immediately followed by the anonymous Minnerede Lament for a Noble Duchess. Here the poet meets a group of knights and friends who mourn the death of a Duchess of Carinthia and Tyrol, née Countess of Savoy. They remember the time when the beloved woman was still alive and describe, among other things, a tournament as it used to take place at her court. Richter and Emil Schaus saw a connection between the two descriptions of tournaments as early as the 19th century. While Richter only recognized a dependency, Schaus went so far as to assume that both works were written by the same author. In addition to the linguistic similarity of the tournament descriptions, he also saw evidence of this in the otherwise unattested word walke(n) (meaning \"balcony\"), which is found in both Minnereden. Ehrismann also sees an identity of authorship \"proven by various literal echoes\", while Niewöhner rules out an identity of authorship due to linguistic deviations and \"considerable differences in verse technique and style\". Although Glier also sees linguistic differences, he does not want to rule out a similarity of authorship: \"The linguistic differences are not so significant. The lament for the dead is probably more clumsy stylistically, metrically and in terms of rhyme than that of the 'Monastery of Love', but it cannot be ruled out that both are works by a poet whose skill in writing has increased. \" In addition, like Schaus, she sees that \"the descriptions of tournaments in both poems coincide to such an extent that one must assume some kind of dependency behind them.\" The fact that both Minnereden were transmitted together in the Donaueschingen Codex 104 as well as in the Heidelberg Cod. pal. germ. 313 also speaks in favor of the existence of a single author.\nLaßberg assumes that the deceased countess was the third wife of Henry of Carinthia, Beatrice of Savoy. As the lament reacts to the death of the lady and, according to linguistic indications, was written earlier than the Monastery of Love, this means that the Monastery of Love was written after 1331.\nThe author's social background could also be determined more precisely if the authors were the same. In the Lament for a Noble Duchess, the author calls himself a \"junker\", as in the Monastery of Love, and is a wandering singer of knightly rank. He can read and write and is a Swabian, \"a traveller who seeks to console the Carinthian duke for a good reward with an allegory according to the taste of the time [...] and who at another time wants to earn the gratitude of Louis the Bavarian through a fantastic glorification of the imperial favourite creation.\"\n\n\n=== Ettal Monastery ===\n\nThe search for a connection between the Monastery of Love and Ettal Monastery has been very persistent in research into the date of origin, which, as Wolfgang Achnitz shows, has proved fruitless. Due to the foundation of Ettal in 1330, this would mean that the Monastery of Love was founded in the 1330s or shortly after the construction of the monastery up to 1350 at the latest.\n\n\n==== The Ettal Rule ====\nThe Ettal Monastery was founded in 1330 and received a written code of life in 1332 with the Ettal Rule, which was written in German and defined everyday life in the monastery. In addition to priests and monks, 13 knights and their wives were to live in the monastery. If a knight died, his wife was allowed to remain in the monastery until her death. The knights and their wives were allowed to go hunting and gamble, but not for money. Dancing and excessive consumption of alcohol were also forbidden, children were not allowed to be brought into the monastery; children born in the monastery had to leave Ettal after the age of three. Clothing was to be simple and color-coded. Knights were not allowed to have their own horses, but could borrow horses from the monastery's master.\n\nThe monastery of Love also has a \"monastery rule\", which runs through the text like a common thread. It is repeatedly emphasized that an inhabitant of the monastery must abide by the rules. This consists of being subject to Love and not acting contrary to it. At the same time, only those who have actually been hit by dü Minn mit ir strale can remain in the monastery. The first-person narrator thus summarizes correctly: der hat gar unrecht / er sy ritter oder knecht / der sich dez nimet an / das er nit in hertzen mag han. Only if the action is characterized by love in the broadest sense is it a good action. At the same time, unwritten rules can be recognized in everyday monastic life. The monastery residents are allowed to play for valuables, they throw dice, play mill, bowl and dance. It is up to the inhabitants to decide what clothes they wear and while the monastery rules explicitly state that hats must be simple, the first thing the narrator notices about the messenger of love is her hat, which is adorned with an ostrich feather and other ornaments. Horses are so plentiful in the monastery that they can even be lent to visitors for the tournament. Richter therefore points out that \"the rule of Ettal [...] in some points [says] the exact opposite of that of the Monastery of Love\". Even more than 50 years later, there is no certainty: \"The model could have been the constitution that Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian gave to the knightly monastery of Ettal founded by him in 1332, but the poet certainly did not intend a realistic depiction.\"\n\n\n==== The monastery as a knights' convent ====\nIn addition to a convent of monks under the direction of the abbot, Ettal Monastery also had a convent of knights led by a master and a convent of women under the direction of the mistress. At this time, Ettal Monastery was therefore more like a knights' convent with monastic forms, which also existed in the Monastery of Love. Here it says: daz ist ain raine / gesellicklichü bruderschaft. / ich wont, daz sölichü ritterschaft / in dekainem closter möchte sin. Research has also seen this connection: \"Ettal offered him [the author] the idea of the chivalric monastery, he worked it out roughly\" by, for example, turning the master and the mistress into an abbot and an abbess and a prior and a prioress. As the author's intention was not a realistic depiction of the Ettal monastery, the joys of such a life were emphasized and the inhabitants of the monastery were allowed to dance, play and fight in tournaments.\n\n\n==== The monastery building ====\n\nEttal Monastery was originally a dodecagonal Gothic central building, which was only extended by numerous annexes over the centuries. According to Schaus, the unusual shape could have given the author the idea of a belt of months, which he transferred to the Monastery of Love. Although the monastery building of the Minnerede is round, it has twelve gates, each representing a month and creating twelve different climatic zones in the monastery interior and anteroom.\n\n\n== The monastery of Minne - an upside-down world ==\nIn comparison with other Minnereden or with details of the rules of the order and the building of the Ettal monastery, the search for a coherent overall concept of The Monastery of Love quickly reveals inconsistencies and breaks that prevent a conclusive assessment.\nBut as soon as one stops taking the text seriously, it proves to be a rare gem of parodic literature: In a reversal of classical material and motifs from heroic epic and love poetry, a hero appears in The Monastery of Love who believes he is doing everything right and stumbles from one blunder to the next - a Don Quixote avant la lettre.\n\n\n== Current research status ==\nIn 2006, Wolfgang Achnitz discussed previous research on the Monastery of Love in the area of chronological classification through connections between the Monastery of Love and the Ettal Monastery or the League of Lions and summarized his findings:\"In any case, the result is that dependencies, which would in any case only be of significance for an exact dating of the Minne narrative, cannot be proven, since parallels can be discovered to almost all the rules prevailing in the Monastery of Love in the statutes of the great orders of chivalry (Knights of St. John, Knights Templar, Teutonic Knights) as well as in the literature of the preceding period. The same applies to the tournament awards, which were often used in a similar form at tournaments and festivals of the knightly societies in the 14th century.\"\n- Wolfgang Achnitz, 2006\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Editions ==\nJoseph von Laßberg (ed.): Lieder Saal.

        "content": "Milton \"Jack\" Snow (April 9, 1905 – March 1986) was an American photographer who extensively photographed the environmental degradation of Navajo land and the Diné people in the American Southwest.  Snow's career spanned twenty years, focusing on U.S.–Navajo relations.\nSnow was employed by the Navajo Service for this project after the impact of \"John Collier's draconian Livestock Reduction Program of the 1930's and 40s.\"\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSnow was born in Ensley, Alabama, on April 9, 1905, to Maud and Joseph Snow. He attended Riverside Polytechnic High School, and later studied geology and photography at Riverside Junior College.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nSnow was hired by the Los Angeles Museum in 1929 as the institution's archaeological fieldman and photographer. He went on to photograph the Wupatki National Monument in 1934. Following that he was hired by the Museum of Northern Arizona as a staff photographer. In 1935 he became employed by the Works Progress Administration to photograph the Navajo Nation, and the social, environmental and economic conditions of the Diné people. \nIn 1937, he was hired by the Navajo Service where he was charged with creating a photography department to document the \"impact of federal programs on Navajo lives.\" He built a darkroom at the Navajo Service Employees' Club in Window Rock, Arizona. He also constructed a mobile darkroom in a panel truck. \nWriting in The Avery Review, Diné writer Zoë Toledo stated, \"In the 1930s, federal officials invented a narrative of the decline of Native land\" which was linked livestock husbandry on the Navajo Nation to erosion. The Navajo Livestock Reduction Program was created by John Collier, the Indian Affairs Commissioner in the 1930s, which resulted in the Diné people losing more than half their livestock, causing \"massive trauma to the Navajo world.\" The program negatively impacted land use, religious practices, health, education and tribal government. The Diné people refer to the destructive impact of the program as the \"Second Long Walk\" due to the ways it harmed their way of life and economy (they made half their income from livestock).\nIn the late 1940s he photographed numerous trading posts on Navajo land; these images are in the archives of the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe, New Mexico. \nIn the 1950s, Snow photographed uranium mining on Navajo lands and the impact thereof on the people and their land.\nIn 1985, the U.S. government released between 20,000 and 30,000 photographs taken on the Navajo Reservation between the 1880s and mid-1900s. These included the Snow Collection, which were considered \"priceless\" because they documented times when the Navajo Nation was undergoing rapid change.\n\n\n=== Exhibitions ===\nIn 2023 the Navajo Nation Museum received support from the Henry Luce Foundation to present an exhibition of his work. A solo show of his photographs were exhibited in 2024 at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology.\n\n\n== Death ==\nSnow died in March 1986 in New Mexico.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nHis Kéyah tse Khoi' = Land of Cañons (1941) portfolio is held in the Arizona Archives. It documents the landscape, and arts and crafts of the Diné people of New Mexico and Arizona. A selection of his photographs, Milton \"Jack\" Snow: Black and White photos used in \"A Political History of the Navajo Tribe, 1898-1970\" are held in the New Mexico Archives at the University of New Mexico Center for Southwest Research & Special Collections / Robert W. Young Pictorial Collection (PICT).\nHis work is held in the permanent collection of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, the Navajo Nation Museum, the National Archives and Records Administration, the Special Collections and Archives of Northern Arizona University, and the Palace of the Governors photo archives.\nThe U.S. National Archives and Records Administration holds 219 of his images images under the name Milton Snow, and some are held in the archive under his nickname, Jack Snow.\n\n\n== References ==",
