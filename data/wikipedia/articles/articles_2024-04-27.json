        "content": "Luis Ignacio de Arana y Ybarra (1909 – 15 January 1999) was a Spanish amateur golfer who won multiple titles in Spanish amateur tournaments.\nHe was the younger brother of Javier de Arana, who also played golf.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nLuis Ignacio de Arana was born in 1909 as the son of Luis Arana y Urigüen and Dolores de Ybarra y Lope de Calle. His father was a successful businessman who was deeply involved with the introduction of sports to Bilbao at the beginning of the 20th century, practicing football, athletics, sailing and golf. \nArana married Sofía de Ybarra y Mac-Mahón, and the couple had five children, Íñigo, Iciar, Gonzalo, Teresa, and Álvaro de Arana e Ybarra. The book Veranos en el Cantábrico (Summers in Cantabria) delves into the family album of the aristocracy and upper bourgeoisie who spent their holidays in the Basque Country, Cantabria, and Asturias, and includes a picture of Íñigo in the arms of his mother Sofía in Ereaga and another shows the little Iciar on board of the yacht \"María del Carmen\", property of the Count of Cadagua, amidst a group of girls, governesses and a sailor from the ship.\n\n\n== Sports career ==\nLuis Ignacio started playing golf at the age of 10 years, in the 11-hole course of the Real Sociedad de Golf de Neguri, which had been co-founded by his father in 1911 and was located a mere 500 meters from his summer home in Las Arenas, Getxo.\nTogether with his brother Javier, he became the leading Spanish amateur golfer, as well as one of the best players in Continental Europe, displaying a great competitiveness between them both on and off the course. Notably, Luis Ignacio faced his younger brother in eight consecutive Puerta de Hierro National Cup finals, winning three of them in 1932, 1935, and 1941. The tournament was suspended during the Spanish Civil War, being reopened in 1941 under the new name of Spanish International Amateur Championship, with Arana winning its inaugural edition and then adding a further two titles in 1947 and 1949, beating in the finals Eugenio Machado and Enrique Fernández Villaverde, respectively. He also won the national Amateur Championship three times in 1941, 1943, and 1945, beating Agusto Batlló and Santiago Ugarte in the latter two finals.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn his later life, Arana became a professor at the J.L.T Higher School of Bilbao. In 1975, he wrote and published a book called \"Exercises, topics and problems in topography, geodesy and position astronomy\".\n\n\n== Death ==\nArana died on 15 January 1999, at the age of 90. The funeral service was celebrated on the following day, at seven in the afternoon, in the parish church of Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes in Las Arenas.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Antonio Vega de Seoane Echeverría (7 January 1887 – 8 May 1943) was a Spanish mining engineer, businessman, and politician who served as a mayor of San Sebastián during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. In his youth, he played both tennis and football for Atlético Madrid and Athletic Bilbao, and then served as the president of Real Sociedad twice.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nAntonio Vega de Seoane was born on 7 January 1887 in San Sebastián, as the son of Baldomero Vega de Seoane, who was a military man and politician who served as a Deputy for Pego, Alicante.\nIn 1912, Vega de Seoane married Emilia Barroso, daughter of the influential liberal politician Antonio Barroso Castillo, who was a minister in several cabinets between 1906 and 1916. The couple had three children Antonio María, Eduardo, and Gonzalo. His first-born Antonio Vega de Seoane Barroso was also a mayor of San Sebastián and president of Real Sociedad.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nIn 1904, Vega de Seoane was among the founding members of San Sebastián Recreation Club, which was the very first football club in San Sebastián, and together with Alfonso Sena and Juan Arzuaga, he was then part of the Recreation Club side that played in the 1905 Copa del Rey. At the end of the season, he moved to Madrid to study mining engineering at the Escuela Superior de Minas, and just like so many other students from that school, including Ricardo de Gondra and Raimundo Moreno (Pichichi's brother), he began playing football in the ranks of Athletic Club de Madrid. On 20 February 1907, Vega de Seoane appears in the club's board of directors chaired by Ricardo de Gondra as the first captain of the tennis section, with Fernando Asuero as the second captain.\nHis outstanding performances at the club led him to be loaned to Atlético's subsidiary, Athletic Bilbao, specifically for the 1909 Copa del Rey, where he played alongside the likes of Luis Saura del Pan, Julián Ruete, and André Didisheim as Bilbao were knocked out in the first round by Club Ciclista of San Sebastián.\nWhen he returned to his hometown, Vega de Seoane was elected as the third president of Real Sociedad in 1915, a position that he held for two years until 1917, when he was replaced by Xabier Peña, but then served a second mandate between 1924 and 1927, when he already was the mayor of San Sebastián.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nAs a Mining Engineer, Vega de Seoane practiced his profession in countless Spanish exploitations, and was also in charge of the Gipuzkoa fishing owners, creating various modern industries in Pasaia. He was president of the Spanish Federation of Fishing Owners and of the Asociación de Armadores y Ezportadores. His multiple industrial activities and his relevant performance in the cultural media earned him numerous relationships.\n\n\n== Politic career ==\n\nHe was mayor of the city of San Sebastián from 1 October 1923 until 22 March of the following year, thus becoming the first mayor of San Sebastián appointed by the government of the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera. On 21 December 1923, he baptized the Orfeón de la Chestnut ahead of its performance that brought together a group of friends from the Gaztelupe Society, which did not have a piano, hence rehearsing the performance at the Círculo Tradicionalista, on the first floor of Calle Mayor.\nHe resigned a few months after exercising his mandate, dissatisfied with the government of Primo de Rivera, but in the following years, he continued to be connected with municipal politics.\n\n\n== Death ==\nVega de Seoane died on 8 May 1943 in San Sebastián, at the age of 56. His mortal remains were buried in the Poblenou Cemetery and the funeral ceremonies were held in the parish church of Santa María, constituted two major stages of mourning.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was a daughter of Gen. William J. Behan, a prominent southern merchant and sugar planter who served as Mayor of New Orleans, and Kate Walker Behan, a social leader and philanthropist of the city.\nShe was educated at home by skilled governesses, and had all the advantages of much travel. Her associations in New Orleans made the acquisition of the French language easy and natural, and she was thus master of two languages. Her education was completed, and she made her début in society in New Orleans in 1891.\n\nThe most coveted of all social honors in New Orleans in that era was to be chosen queen in the Mardi Gras Carnival. That honor fell to Behan in the carnival of 1891. She was the youngest woman yet selected for coronation in that festival.\nOn October 18, 1892, in New Orleans, she married Dr. Hampden Sidney Lewis.\nIn 1913, she received a degree in French literature from the University of the Sorbonne.\nLewis made a gift to the Howard Memorial Library in 1924: a collection of literature dealing with the Confederacy period of the Confederacy. The books and the complete set of the Southern Historical Society papers belonged to Lewis' parents.\nHer jewels from the Rex Ball, Carnival of 1891, were donated to the Louisiana State Museum in 1929.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Works related to Woman of the Century/Bessie Behan at Wikisource",

        "content": "Théophile Panadis (28 February 1889 – 30 October 1966) was an Abenaki Canadian storyteller and artist who is known for his defense of the Abenaki language, culture, tradition, and way of life. He was declared a Person of National Historic Significance by Parks Canada in 2011 and has a trilingual plaque dedicated to him located in Odanak, Quebec.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nThéophile Panadis was born on February 28, 1889, in the Abenaki village of Odanak, Quebec, as the sixth child of Nicolas Panadis and Monique Wawanolett. He grew up when traditional Abenaki culture, knowledge, and ways of life were still very much alive. From his father, uncle, and other men in the community Panadis learned to hunt and fish and live off the land for weeks and months at a time.\nHe would also sell furs he caught to the Hudson's Bay Company and other merchants in Montreal. Panadis and his family also made various traditional Abenaki crafts, such as baskets, moccasins, snowshoes, and canoes, to sell to tourists in order to make money. Panadis was taken out of school by his father at the age of fourteen to assist him with hunting.\n\n\n== Work as \"The Storyteller\" ==\nBy the mid-20th century while the way of the Abenaki was under threat from the Canadian government's colonial practices and the growing forestry industry in Quebec Panadis committed himself to ensure the continuation of traditional skills and knowledge among the Abenaki people. Through this work, he became known as “8tlokad”, or \"The Storyteller\". Panadis would tell stories of Abenaki history and culture, including the first time the Abenaki travelled to the Saint-François River. He also told stories about maewlinnoak, those with great spiritual power, and traditional creation tales.\nHe began working with multiple ethnologists, A. Irving Hallowell in the 1920s and Gordon M. Day in the 1950s and 1960s, being an invaluable source of information for recording the traditions, myths, cosmology, ceremonies, and material culture of the Abenaki. As an example, he shared knowledge of the boundaries of family hunting territories with Hallowell so they could create a map together.\nPanadis was also trilingual, speaking English, French, and Abenaki, and worked to preserve the Abenaki language. He also acted as a guide for sport-hunting and sport-fishing, led a dance group, and worked as an artist. His art included paintings, engravings, sculptures, canoes, and calumets. He would create work for friends and tourists and have people watch him create to transmit and preserve the knowledge and crafts he used.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nPanadis had a son, Adrien Paradis, with Emma Groslouis.\nPanadis also struggled with alcoholism throughout his life.\nIn 1958 he was struck by a truck and developed bursitis in his shoulder, which hindered his ability to paddle and thus his ability to be a guide. He also had issues with cataracts.\nOn October 29, 1966, Panadis was struck by a drunk driver while walking home from the grocery store. He was transported to the hospital in Nicolet and died the following day.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nPanadis is remembered as a \"true legend\" and a \"living history book\" and helped contribute to the strength and influence of Abenaki arts and identity.\nIn 2011 he was declared a Person of National Historic Significance by Parks Canada as part of a group of 13 new historical designations of people, sites, and events relating to Indigenous history in Canada. His plaque, which is presented in Abenaki, English, and French, was unveiled on August 22, 2021, in Odanak.\nIn 2022 Odanak singer-songwriter Mali Obomsawin sampled Panadis's voice in the track \"Pedegwajois\" from her debut album Sweet Tooth (2022). Panadis tells a story for the first two minutes of the song while Obomsawin accompanies with bass. Filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin also wrote a song dedicated to Panadis titled \"Theo\" and describes him as a major influence on her work.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "St Martin's Church is the parish church of Bulmer, North Yorkshire, a village in England.\nThe oldest part of the church is the nave, which dates from the 11th century, and may be before or after the Norman Conquest.  The chancel dates from the early 12th century, while the south nave door was added in the second half of the century.  Around 1400, a north chapel was added, the tower and quire were rebuilt, and the nave walls were heightened.  The upper part of the tower was rebuilt in 1637, and buttresses were added.  In the 18th century, the chapel was demolished, and new windows were inserted in the walls of the nave.  A porch was added around 1800.  In 1893, James Demaine and Walter Brierley restored the church, during which process they rebuilt the chancel.  The church was grade I listed in 1954.\n\nThe church is built of limestone and sandstone, with a roof of Westmorland slate to the nave and corrugated iron to the chancel.  The church consists of a nave, a south porch, a two-bay chancel, and a west tower.  The tower has three stages, a string course, diagonal buttresses, a small lancet window, double lancet bell openings, and an embattled parapet with corner pinnacles and a datestone.  The porch has a late 12th-century doorway with two orders on moulded capitals.  Two round-headed 11th-century windows survive on the south side of the nave, while the 15th- and 18th-century windows have square heads.  In the porch is a memorial to Christopher Thompson, blacksmith at Castle Howard, who died in 1773.\n\nInside the church is the head of a Saxon wheel-cross.  There is an effigy of John de Bulmer, who died in the 1270s, and a slab commemorating Ralph Bulmer, who died in 1461.  The 18th-century pulpit is octagonal, while there is a 13th-century font, with a circular bowl, and an octagonal stem and base.  The rood screen is 15th century.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Bulmer, North Yorkshire\n\n\n== References ==",

He played college football for the Yale Bulldogs and South Carolina Gamecocks and was selected by the Broncos in the seventh round of the 2024 NFL draft.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGargiulo was born on July 19, 2000, in Yorktown Heights, New York. He first played football in third grade and later was a standout at Somers High School, where he was a two-way lineman and also played basketball. At Somers, he won a starting job as a sophomore and helped them win the state championship the next year, being named All-League and All-Section. He received All-State honors as a senior and was chosen the league's most valuable player. He was named to the state's Super 11 and Golden Dozen teams but was a zero-star recruit for college, ultimately committing to play for the FCS Yale Bulldogs.\n\n\n== College career ==\nGargiulo redshirted his freshman year at Yale in 2018, playing one game, and then won the starting job at left tackle in the 2019 season. He started all 10 games in the 2019 season, and then missed the 2020 season as it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He broke his fibula and right ankle early on in the 2021 season and missed the rest of the year. He then returned for the 2022 season and was selected team captain, ultimately winning first-team All-Ivy League honors as well as being selected All-New England by the New England Football Writers Association.\nGargiulo opted to play a final season of college football in 2023 and transferred to the South Carolina Gamecocks. He started all 12 games in his lone year with the Gamecocks, the first five at left guard before shifting to center for the rest of the year. Gargiulo was the team captain for South Carolina and received third-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) honors at the end of the year. He finished his collegiate career having started 36 games, totaling 17 at center, 14 at left tackle and five at left guard. He played at the 2024 Hula Bowl and was invited to the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nGargiulo was selected in the seventh round (256th overall) – with the second-to-last pick – in the 2024 NFL draft by the Denver Broncos, becoming the first athlete from Somers High School ever to be chosen.\n\n\n== References ==",

On January 1, 2002, that municipality was merged into the new municipality of Wijdemeren, which meant that his position was abolished. From that date he was acting mayor of the municipality of Castricum, which had also just been reorganized. In mid-June, Aaltje Emmens-Knol was appointed mayor there and a month later he became acting mayor again, now in Brummen to replace the long-term ill mayor Lynde Blok. In the last months of 2005 he was acting mayor of Driebergen-Rijsenburg where he started his new political career. On January 1, 2006, that municipality was merged into the new municipality of Utrechtse Heuvelrug. He was then acting mayor of the municipality of Weesp from June 6, 2006, to January 1, 2007, and he was acting mayor of Medemblik until September 2007, after which he finally became an observer in Blaricum.\nKozijn died on 26 April 2024, at the age of 83.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Men Trapped in Men's Bodies: Narratives of Autogynephilic Transsexualism is a 2013 book on the subject of autogynephilia and transgender women written by sexologist Anne Lawrence. In the book, she discusses autogynephilia, a paraphilia in which a person is sexually attracted to and aroused by the thought or image of themselves as female. It is defined as an erotic target location error, as a self-directed form of gynephilia, and as a sexuoromantic orientation. Autogynephilia is theorized by some to be the motivating etiology for a subset of transgender women. It is also theorized to be the cause of the feelings and behaviors of certain non-transgender males, including non-transitioning autogynephiles (sometimes called \"crossdreamers\") and erotic crossdressers (transvestic fetishists). In respect to the latter, transvestic fetishism is defined as a subtype of autogynephilia. Lawrence herself is a transgender woman and self-identifies as autogynephilic. The book was published in 2013 by Springer in New York.\nMen Trapped in Men's Bodies: Narratives of Autogynephilic Transsexualism is 242 pages in length and has 12 chapters. Its chapters include \"Men Trapped in Men's Bodies\", \"Theory and Case Histories\", \"Narratives by Autogynephilic Transsexuals\", \"Confronting Autogynephilia\", \"Developmental Histories\", \"Manifestations of Autogynephilia\", \"Autogynephilia and Heterosexuality\", \"Sex with Men\", \"Other Aspects of Autogynephilic Sexuality\", \"Debating the Meaning of Autogynephilia\", \"Narratives by Nontranssexual Autogynephiles\", and \"Autogynephilic Transsexualism in Perspective\". It includes 249 first-person narratives of autogynephilia by transgender women and 52 narratives of autogynephilia by non-transgender males (301 narratives in total) that were submitted to and collected by Lawrence. This followed earlier collections of the same kinds of narratives that Lawrence had published in 1999. Besides the book, Lawrence has published a number of literature reviews on autogynephilia.\nThe book has a similar title to a 1998 essay published by Lawrence in Transgender Tapestry called Men Trapped in Men's Bodies: An Introduction to the Concept of Autogynephilia and to a 1999 essay presented by Lawrence at the 16th Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA) symposium known as Men Trapped in Men's Bodies: Autogynephilic Eroticism as a Motive for Seeking Sex Reassignment. Both of these essays were also previously published on Lawrence's website, in addition to her earlier 1999 collections of autogynephilia narratives. The phrase \"men trapped in men's bodies\" refers to the fact that transgender women are often described as \"women trapped in men's bodies\", yet autogynephilic transgender women are said not to resemble women in terms of their behavioral characteristics and life histories but instead to be more similar to men in these areas and to have an intense desire to become women due to their autogynephilic feelings. Hence, these transgender women, relative to pretransition, could, in a sense, alternatively be described as \"men trapped in men's bodies\".\nMen Trapped in Men's Bodies: Narratives of Autogynephilic Transsexualism has received several published book reviews, including by psychologist Richard Lippa, psychiatrist Stephen B. Levine, sexologist Kevin Hsu, psychologist Richard Carroll, and psychologist Margaret Nichols. \nMany transgender women reject autogynephilia as an explanation for their feelings and consider the concept to be offensive. Criticisms have been lobbied against the construct of autogynephilia on a variety of grounds. However, some individuals, most famously Lawrence herself, identify with autogynephilia and find that it accurately describes their experiences. That some individuals identify with autogynephilia is also evidenced by the 301 narratives of autogynephilia by transgender and non-transgender people that were submitted to and published by Lawrence.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlanchard's transsexualism typology\nThe Man Who Would Be Queen\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBook - Anne A.

        "content": "Lorenzo de Medrano y Treviño (August 10, 1787 – April 11, 1854) was a noble from the House of Medrano and the Spanish Lieutenant Colonel of Engineers, artilleryman, and brigade sergeant major of the coast of Granada, notable for his extensive military service during the Peninsular War. Medrano played critical roles in several key battles and military engagements, including the defense of the Júcar River crossing, the Battle of the Fields of Tudela, and the sieges of Morella and Sagunto castles. He was particularly distinguished during the \"Escape of the Sappers\" at the outset of the Peninsular War, leading troops from Alcalá de Henares to Valencia. Lorenzo was the younger brother of the important military leader and liberal politician Diego de Medrano y Treviño.\n\n\n== Military career ==\n\nDon Lorenzo de Medrano was the Captain, Chief, and Lieutenant Colonel of Engineers and the sole representative of the Spanish Military Corps of Engineers in the Spanish Empire during the 19th century, ensuring the military legacy of his family. The Spanish Military corps of Engineers has its origin in the teachings of the first modern and Royal Military and Mathematics Academy of Brussels in Europe, established in 1675 and directed by the Master of Mathematics, Engineer and General of the Artillery Don Sebastian Fernández de Medrano (and later patronized and protected by the Marquess and Governor Don Francisco Antonio de Agurto Salcedo Medrano Zúñiga) at the request of Don Carlos de Aragón de Gurrea, 9th Duke of Villahermosa, in order to correct the shortage of artillerymen and engineers from the Spanish Tercio.\nWhen Sebastian's disciple Lieutenant General Jorge Próspero de Verboom was appointed Chief Engineer on January 13, 1710, and tasked with establishing and organizing the Corps of Engineers, one of his first thoughts was the creation of Military Academies using the same curriculum as his mentor's. Verboom proposed Military Academies in Oran, Cueta and Barcelona, all three were established. The Colonel of Engineers Joaquín de la Llave gave a lecture about Medrano's enduring influence on the methodologies employed in later military academies and its pivotal role in training engineers and military personnel during a 1905 conference on establishing the Military and Mathematics Academy director Sebastián Fernández de Medrano as a geographer.\n\n\n=== Education and early military career ===\n\nDon Lorenzo de Medrano's military career commenced in July 1802 when he joined as a cadet in the Provincial Regiment of Ciudad Real. Self-taught in mathematics, he advanced to the Corps of Engineers as a second lieutenant on July 13, 1803, and subsequently pursued further studies at the Engineering Academy of Alcalá de Henares. Upon completing his studies, he was promoted to lieutenant on February 25, 1806, and assigned to the Corps' Sub-inspection Directorate in Valencia.\n\n\n=== Enlisting in the army ===\nWhen news of the May 2, 1808 uprising in Madrid reached Valencia, Lorenzo joined the army formed there, serving until September 1809 before transferring to command a Sappers' Company in the Army of Catalonia.\n\n\n==== Escape of the Sappers (1808) ====\nDuring the early stages of the War of Independence, an incident known as the \"Escape of the Sappers\" occurred. It involved a mass departure of officers and troops from the Engineering Academy in Alcalá de Henares to Valencia to join forces rebelling against the French occupation. After enduring difficult marches and constant threats from French forces, they arrived in Cuarte on June 5. Sergeant Major Veguer arrived on June 7 and dispatched Second Lieutenant Manzanares with a letter to the captain general, following advice from Lieutenant \"D. Lorenzo Medrano.\" Upon visiting the Count of Cervellón, they were instructed to surrender their weapons as other garrisons had. However, Upon hearing the troops should surrender their weapons, Lieutenant Lorenzo de Medrano declared they would \"perish a thousand times with them rather than surrender.\" A cross was awarded for their bravery.\n\n\n=== Battle of the fields of Tudela ===\nMedrano later played a key role in the defense and subsequent pursuit of the enemy at the Júcar River crossing, and fought at the Battle of the Fields of Tudela in November 1808. Following a grueling retreat to Cuenca, he returned to Valencia.\n\n\n=== Regional fortification of Cuenca ===\nThe Segorbe town council later sought Don Lorenzo de Medrano's expertise for regional fortification in Cuenca, requesting:\n\n\"an agreement on the fortification of the area and commissioning of Engineer Captain Lorenzo Medrano to oversee the works.\"\n\n\n=== Army of Catalonia ===\nIn 1809 Don Lorenzo de Medrano was assigned a Sapper company in the Army of Catalonia. In his role with the Army of Catalonia, he aided in the relief of Girona and the retreat from Albentosa to Valencia. Lorenzo's brother Don José de Medrano y Treviño was also a combatant in the War of Independence as an artilleryman, participating in the siege of Girona and the defense of Montjuich in Barcelona, where his heroism earned him a promotion to captain. His brother Don José de Medrano authored a manuscript about the siege of Girona.\nAs Commander of Engineers of the Vanguard Division in early 1810, Lorenzo de Medrano faced the French forces of Napoleon near Valencia. He was also active in 1810 around Morella and during the siege of its castle, and aided in the relief of the fortress of Tortosa. In May 1811, he marched with his division from Peñíscola to aid the fortress of Tarragona.\n\n\n=== Captain and the sole representative of the Corps of Engineers ===\n\nHe was involved in the retreat from the kingdom of Aragon to Valencia and in the defense of the castle of Murviedro (Valencia). Lorenzo de Medrano participated, as captain and the sole representative of the Corps of Engineers, in the defense of the castle of Sagunto. Specifically, during the defense of Sagunto castle from September 23 to October 26, 1811, he was noted for his command alongside sapper Villalta:\n\n\"The Chief of Engineers Captain D. Lorenzo Medrano, and the sapper Villalta, along with other commanders and troops of other Arms were distinguished.\"\nHe skillfully managed the breach repairs, with the governor later commending the defenders for their \"amazing bravery,\" and recognizing their efforts with awards. He was made a prisoner by the French when the fortress surrendered.\n\n\n=== Rise in ranks and retirement ===\nAfter the war, Medrano was justified for his military and political actions and assigned to Granada's coast as a brigade sergeant major in September 1815, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel of Engineers earlier that month. He served in the Command of the Corps in Navarre until 1821, when he retired to Ciudad Real. He died on April 11, 1854.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\nDon Lorenzo de Medrano y Treviño was the husband of Doña María de Morales, and father of Don José de Medrano y Morales, Doña Carmen, and Doña Manuela de Medrano y Morales.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nDon Lorenzo belongs to the ancient and noble House of Medrano, one of the most powerful in the Sierra de Cameros and in Soria. For their military contributions, the House of Medrano obtained a second coat of arms in 1212, it featured an argent or golden fleur-de-lis cross of Calatrava on a blood-red field, symbolizing their ancient lineage through its straightforward design. Don Martín López de Medrano and Don Pedro Gonzalez de Medrano bore this emblem into the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 and again during the notable capture of Baza on Saint Andrew's Day in 1227. To commemorate this victorious day, the shield was adorned with eight crosses of Saint Andrew, similar to other noble banners.\n\nLorenzo de Medrano and his family are generational patrons of the Franciscan Order. In approximately 1211, a captain of the Medrano family held the lordship of the castle and town of Agoncillo, situated near the city of Logroño, in the region of La Rioja, Spain. Medrano's son was suffering from a mysterious and untreatable ailment. In 1211, Saint Francis of Assisi roamed those very paths of Agoncillo. In a saintly manner, he visited Medrano's Agoncillo castle, placed his mystical hands upon the ailing Medrano boy, and miraculously healed him, securing the Medrano lineage in Agoncillo. As a result, the Medrano family are distinguished by their devotion to Saint Francis of Assisi and their generational patronage of the Franciscan order. The Medrano family generously donated some land, including a tower, situated close to the Ebro River within the city of Logroño as a gift to Saint Francis, establishing the first Spanish convent of his Order there. Unfortunately, despite its centuries-long legacy of glory and sanctity, the convent met its demise in the 19th century due to the advent of liberalism and its accompanying laws. Today, the remnants of its walls still remain.\n\n\n=== Parents ===\nDon Lorenzo de Medrano was the son of Don José de Medrano y Monroy, baptized in Almagro on 31 March  1748. Lord of all the majorats, entailments, and patronages of the family, José de Medrano y Monroy married the VI Lady of the Majorat of Valdarachas, Doña Isabel de Treviño y Treviño. Through this marriage, Don José de Medrano became a resident of Ciudad Real. The wedding took place in the town of Miguelturra, four kilometers from Ciudad Real on the road to Almagro, on 16 February 1776. Don José de Medrano significantly increased and improved his and his wife's assets, as evidenced in the family archive, finally making his will in Ciudad Real on 30 September 1800. His wife, the VI Lady of the Majorat of Valdarachas, made hers in the same city on 10 August 1787.\n\n\n=== Ancestry ===\n\nDon Lorenzo de Medrano y Treviño was the paternal great-great-great-grandson of Don Juan Valeriana de Medrano y Herruz. In the city of Almagro, in La Mancha, upon marrying into and inheriting the lordships and representations of the House of Zúñiga, Don Juan Valeriana de Medrano y Herruz from La Mancha added the well-known sable band of Zúñiga to the shield of the Medrano family.\nDon Juan Valeriana de Medrano y Herruz was the son of Don Juan de la Cámara de Medrano and Doña Antonia de Herruz y Vergara and the paternal grandson of Don Sancho González de Almazán, of the Medrano lineage, a resident of the town of Garray, in Soria, around the year 1480. Don Juan Valeriana was baptized in the town of Arenas on 14 April 1599, with his aunt and godparents Doña Catalina de Medrano and her husband, licentiate Avila de Alarcón. He married Doña Mariana de Zúñiga y Oviedo in Almagro on 3 September 1626. Don Juan Valeriana de Medrano made his will in Almagro on 29 November  1649, and his wife, Doña Mariana de Zúñiga, in the same place on 21 January 1675.\nDon Lorenzo's great-great-great-grandmother Doña Mariana de Zúñiga was the daughter of Don Bernardo de Oviedo and Doña Bernarda de Zúñiga, the Lady of the Majorat of Esparragués, established by her third great-grandfather, Don García de Pisa, through his will in 1484. She also belonged to the patronage of Almagro, initiated by Don Crstóbal de Oviedo (her great uncle) through his will signed in Madrid on 3 April 1590. This connection brought additional lands and the Zúñigas' sable band to the Medrano family shield in Almagro.\n\n\n=== Great-great grandfather ===\n\nDon Lorenzo is the paternal great-great-grandson of Don Juan Manuel de Medrano y Zúñiga, born in Almagro on 17 June 1627. His great-great-grandfather served as a Familiar of the Holy Office and held prominent roles including Perpetual Alderman, and later the Mayorship and the Alderman of the Holy Brotherhood by the Noble Estate in Almagro. Juan Manuel de Medrano y Zúñiga married Doña María de Peralta y Reinoso, a native of Almagro born on 12 December 1629, on 6 November 1652. Doña María was deeply rooted in local nobility; she was the daughter of Don Juan Ossorio de Peralta, the fourth blood patron of Almagro's Franciscan convent and a Perpetual Alderman, and Doña Jerónima Gutiérrez de Guevara. Her lineage included several patrons of the same Franciscan convent, with her great-great-grandparents establishing their noble status in Illescas in 1585. Her great-granduncle, Don Jerónimo Dávila de la Cueva, founded the Franciscan convent in Almagro in 1597. Restoration efforts began in the 20th century under the patronage of the Medrano family. The mother of the beforementioned Doña María de Peralta y Reinoso was Doña Jerónima Gutiérrez de Guevara, daughter of Don Tomás Gutiérrez de Guevara, who made his will in the City of Saña, in the kingdom of Peru, on 23 May 1634, and Doña Francisca del Salto, sister of the latter and heiress of Don Andrés del Salto y Manzanares, who is the founder of the Majorat of Cervera by his will signed in Almagro on 17 August 1619, thus bringing the Majorat of Cervera and the patronages of San Bartolomé to the Medrano family.\n\n\n=== Great grandfather ===\nDon Lorenzo is the paternal great-grandson of Don Carlos-García de Medrano y Peralta, 8th generation of his name and eldest of the House of Medrano in Almagro due to the death without succession of his elder brother Don Juan de Medrano y Peralta, resident of Arenas, thereby becoming the possessor of the Majorats of Esparragués, Cervera, and other lands in Arenas, Illescas, and Almagro, patron of the Franciscan convent in Almagro and of the chapel of San Bartolomé in Almagro. He was born in 1659, baptized in San Bartolomé de Almagro on March 2. He served as Alderman and Alcalde of Almagro. He married Doña Catalina de León y de Córdoba on June 12, 1704. From this marriage, a sole son was born, Don Francisco de Medrano y de León Peralta y Córdoba.\n\n\n=== Grandfather ===\nDon Lorenzo de Medrano was the paternal grandson of Francisco de Medrano y de León Peralta y Córdoba, 9th generation of the name, born on October 27, 1706, who became the owner, upon his father's death, of the majorats, entailed estates, and  patronages of the family. Dedicated to the military, he attained the rank of Colonel of the Royal Corps Guards. In his city of Almagro, he married Doña Clara de Monroy y Morales, born on October 6, 1714. Don Francisco de Medrano died in Almagro on May 27, 1765. Lorenzo's family are the perpetual lords of the Mayorazgo de Valdarachas.\n\n\n=== Siblings ===\nLorenzo de Medrano y Treviño was the brother of 10 siblings:\n\nDon Francisco de Medrano y Treviño.\nDon Luis de Medrano y Treviño, who fought in the War of Independence with the rank of lieutenant and married Doña Josefa Carreño in Huésear, from which marriage there was no offspring.\nDon José de Medrano y Treviño.

        "content": "Fraserburgh Lifeboat Station is located at the harbour town of Fraserburgh, in the NE corner of Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nA lifeboat was first stationed here in 1805, later becoming the first Scottish station of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), in 1858.\nSince 2002, the station has operated a Trent-class All-weather lifeboat, 14-34\tWillie and May Gall (ON 1259).\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is recorded that in 1805, renowned lifeboat builder Henry Greathead was constructing a lifeboat for Fraserburgh Harbour Commissioners. No details survive, but it is likely that it was a 30-foot non-self-righting boat. A second boat was provided to Fraserburgh in 1831, manufacturer and specification unknown, but by 1851, it was recorded as unfit for purpose.\nIn November 1857, Mr. Lewis Chalmers, Chief Magistrate, wrote to the RNLI, to highlight 13 shipwrecks in the area, over a period of 10 years. Following a visit to the town, Capt. Ward, Inspector of Lifeboats, recommended a lifeboat station, which was agreed in March 1858. A lifeboat was ordered from Forrestt of Limehouse, London, a 30-foot 10-oared self-righting boat, costing £182-1s-2d, along with a launch carriage from Robinsons. A boathouse was constructed by the Harbour Commissioners. The boat was delayed, as it was damaged in a fire at Forrestt's workshop, only arriving in Fraserburgh on 26 October 1858. The boat was named Havelock. Lewis Chalmers was appointed Honorary Secretary.\nA motor-powered lifeboat was placed at Fraserburgh in 1915. Costing £3,715, construction was started at Thames Ironworks, but completed by S.E. Saunders of Cowes, when the Thames Ironworks company failed. The 42-foot lifeboat had a 40 BHP \"Tylor\" petrol-engine, and delivered a speed of 7.45 knots. The lifeboat was funded  by Thomas Dyer-Edwardes, as a \"Thankyou\" for the life of his daughter, Noël Leslie, Countess of Rothes, who had survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and was duly named Lady Rothes (ON 641).\nOn 9 February 1953, the first of 2 disasters struck the Fraserburgh lifeboat. The John and Charles Kennedy (ON 790) was launched to assist a number of fishing boats that were struggling to re-enter Fraserburgh harbour due to the poor sea conditions. Having escorted two vessels to the harbour, it would be the lifeboat  that failed to make the return trip a third time, capsizing as it tried to enter the harbour. A non-self-righting 46ft Watson-class, 5 crew were trapped and drowned in the wreck, and the Coxswain, thrown clear of the capsize, was hit by a piece of wreckage and killed. The John and Charles Kennedy had been launched 99 times, and saved 199 lives. In just 12 days, enough volunteers had come forward to form a new crew, including Second Coxswain Charles Tait Jnr, sole survivor of the wreck, and son of Bowman, Charles Tait Snr, lost in the disaster.\nAfter a short period with the relief lifeboat John Russell (ON 699), a replacement lifeboat Duchess of Kent (ON 908) was placed at Fraserburgh. She would serve 16 years at Fraserburgh, launching 46 times, and saving 11 lives. But in 1970, Fraserburgh would suffer a second disaster.\nThe Duchess of Kent was launched on 6:30am on 21 January 1970, into a force 8 to 9 gale, to the aid of the Danish fishing boat Opal, taking on water some 40 miles off Fraserburgh. She arrived on scene at 11:00am, to find the Opal in tow from a Russian trawler, and a number of other vessels, including the large Russian ship Victor Kingisepp standing by. Suddenly, a large wave lifted up the bow, and the lifeboat was capsized bow over stern. Great efforts were made to right the vessel by the crew of the Victor Kingisepp, which was achieved by 2:31pm, but too late to save the crew, with the exception of mechanic John Jackson Buchan, who had been thrown into the water, and was rescued from the upturned hull. It would be 8 years later, in 1978, before another lifeboat would be placed at Fraserburgh.\nIn 2001, the RNLI announced that Fraserburgh would receive a new Trent-class lifeboat. Moulded in Fibre Reinforced Composite, and fitted out by Souters of Cowes, she had twin MAN diesel-engines, developing 800 BHP, giving a top speed of 25 knots. Costing £1,240,452, she arrived in Fraserburgh on 8 May 2002. At a ceremony on 7 September 2002, she was named 14-34 Willie and May Gall (ON 1259).\n\n\n== Station honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Fraserburgh\n\nRNLI Gold Medal\nLt.

        "content": "Florence \"Pat\" Brookhart Yount ( March 5, 1909 -November 25, 1988) was an obstetrician, pediatrician, and community leader from Prescott, Arizona. She was the first female physician in the community.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFlorence Hercune Brookhart was born on March 5, 1909, in Washington, Iowa to Smith W. Brookhart and Jennie (née Hercune) Brookhart. She was one of seven children.\nIn 1922, Smith Brookhart was elected to the United States Senate, so the family moved to Washington, D.C. While there, Brookhart attended George Washington University and medical school. She attended medical school despite her father's reluctance due to fears that the life of a doctor would be too difficult. In 1935, Brookhart graduated as one of five women in a class of eighty-eight.\nWhile at medical school, Brookhart met her future husband, C. E. “Ned” Yount Jr., who was planning to join his father's practice in Prescott. After finishing their internships in Wash\nington, D.C., Yount returned to Prescott to practice with his father, and Brookhart went to Chicago to complete a residency in pediatrics. When Brookhart completed her residency, she married Yount on June 22, 1936.\n\n\n== Medical career ==\nOnce she was licensed to practice medicine in Arizona, Florence Brookhart Yount joined her husband and father-in-law's practice. Shortly after joining the practice, Yount realized the state did not have a well-baby clinic, but had a high infant mortality rate. Yount created a well-baby clinic in Prescott at an existing medical clinic. After a year, the county physician credited for the achievement of no children dying during the summer.\nDuring World War II, as the younger doctors went to war, Yount played a large role in the medical community. As the local hospital burned down in 1940, Yount did most of her work, including deliveries, in her office.\n\n\n== Activism and political work ==\nYount led the effort to reopen a Prescott community hospital in the unused Jefferson School. She gathered items to fund the creation and persuaded retired nurses to return to work. The Prescott Community Hospital opened on March 1, 1943, and Yount delivered the first baby there that evening.\nWhen the hospital's expansion exceeded the available space, Yount led the medical community in lobbying Prescott to build a new hospital. Yount also participated in county, state, and national medical societies, worked to bring Blue Cross Blue Shield Association to Arizona, and helped organize Yavapai County's polio campaign.\nIn 1949, Yount joined the State Public Welfare Board, dealing with political issues and limited funds in the distribution of grants.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nThe Younts had one son.\nYount was a member of the founding group of the Methodist Artists Guild and contributed to it as a pastelist. She was also a \"rock hounder,\" collecting geological specimens.\nYount was interested in history. She researched the history of Prescott's hospitals and territorial medicine and wrote a history of the Methodists in Prescott. She was also a member of the Sharlot Hall Museum and was part of the effort to establish the museum's Territorial Women's Memorial Rose Garden. She also helped in the creation of the Fremont House.\n\n\n== Retirement and death ==\nIn 1973, the Younts retired. Florence Brookhart Yount died on November 25, 1988.\nIn 1990, Yount was posthumously inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Saint John Masonic Temple is a historic masonic temple in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. One of Atlantic Canada's oldest lodges, the masonic temple is located on 92 Germain Street in Uptown Saint John. The brick building features an Italianate architectural style. It is four-storeys tall, with the street floor being used for commercial purposes. It is part of the Grand Lodge of New Brunswick. It is within the boundaries of the Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Freemasonry community previously operated a masonic temple in Saint John until its destruction by the Great Fire of Saint John in 1877. Construction on a new masonic temple began following the fire, worked on by architects McKean & Fairweather, and contracted by Alexander Christie & Co. as well as William L. Prince, Esq. The building was completed in 1881, totaling CA$80,000 (equivalent to $2,617,194 in 2021).\nHistorically, the building was used to host Masonic Grand Lodge of New Brunswick meetings annually, including once in 1934 which included John Babington Macaulay Baxter, a former Premier of New Brunswick who served as the province's Grand Master at the time. \nOn the morning of January 26, 1929, the masonic temple was destroyed by fire, with damages estimating to be at $100,000 at the  time. $55,000 of which was insured. Discussions on rebuilding the temple were made the following month, and efforts to rebuild it began being made starting in late May 1929 until being finished by November 26, 1930. On July 11, 1929, during the rebuilding process, Saint John Masonic Temple, Limited. was established under The Royal Gazette.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of historic places in Saint John County, New Brunswick\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBunting, William Franklin (1895).

        "content": "Penelope Blackmore (born 23 April 1984) is a retired Australian rhythmic gymnast. She represented her country internationally.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPenelope started rhythmic gymnastics when she was twelve years old, training five hours a day, six days a week. In 1998 she moved with her family from Melbourne to Sydney.  A year later she was selected to compete at both the 1999 World Championships in Osaka and the Four Continents Competition in Jacksonville. \nIn 2003 she became the Australian national champion. She also competed in the World Championships in Budapest where she finished 49th in the All-Around and 24th in teams.\nIn 2004 she again won the Australian national championships (2nd Hoop, 1st Ball, 2nd Clubs, 1st Ribbon) which gave her the opportunity to qualify as a wild card entrant in the Athens Olympic Games. There she finished 23rd in the qualification round and thus didn't advance to the final.\nAfter the Games, Blackmore announced her retirement from the sport. She now lives in Germany and runs an organisation that assists businesses to transition and evolve in the digital age.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Lord Chamberlain's Plays are a collection of manuscripts held by the British Library comprising scripts of all new plays in Britain that needed to be approved for performance by the Lord Chamberlain between 1824 and 1968. This was a requirement of both the Licensing Act 1737 and the Theatres Act 1843, though his office was not legally entititled to retain the texts until 1912.\nThe collection represents an extensive and unusual research resource curated through censorship of the theatrical medium and also includes letters and administrative documents that provide an insight to the censorship process.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Master of the Revels had overseen theatrical performance since 1545 with the Lord Chamberlain becoming involved in censorship after the Stuart Restoration in 1660. In 1737, responding to satirical performances critical of his government, Robert Walpole introduced statutory censorship through the Licensing Act of 1737 which appointed the Lord Chamberlain as the official theatrical censor. The Act immediately closed all but two \"legitimate\" theatres in London to Covent Garden and Drury Lane and gave the Lord Chamberlain the power to prevent any new play from being performed for any reason.\nThe Theatres Act 1843, also known as the Theatres Regulation Bill, replaced the previous act and implemented proposals made by a select committee of the House of Commons in 1832. Under the new act, the Lord Chamberlain retained the role of censor albeit with slightly restricted powers to only prohibit the performance of plays that were likely 'to do violence to the sentiment of religious reverence', to be indecent, or 'to be calculated to conduce to crime or vice'. On these matters the Lord Chamberlain's office would occasionally consult the Archbishop of Canterbury.\nManuscripts were returned to the Lord Chamberlain's Department from the Public Record Office in 1923 with plays dated between 1824 and 1850 later deposited at the British Library. In 1988 papers relating to the censors' examination were also deposited at the British Library. The earliest plays submitted in 1824 had been sold in 1825 and were passed to the Huntington Library in the United States in 1917.\nThe Theatres Act 1968 finally abolished theatrical censorship in Britain.\n\n\n== A unique historical archive ==\nThrough anti-theatrical prejudice and the act of censorship the Lord Chamberlain's plays have left an extensive historical archive of material that may otherwise have been lost. As such, the archive provides a valuable research resource that highlights contemporary social mores and attitudes to race or homosexuality, and the conviction that performance can have a contagious effect.\nThe comments made about A Patriot For Me by John Osborne submitted for licensing in 1964 reveal contemporary homophopia and the concern that its depiction could have an infectious effect noting that 'presenting homosexuals in their most attractive guise -  dressed as pretty women, will to some degree cause the congregation of homosexuals and provide the means whereby the vice may be acquired'.\nThe archive also curates early Black theatre in Britain including the only known manuscript copy of At What a Price by Una Marson which explores themes of women’s desire, interracial relations and sexual harassment in the workplace. Now relatively obscure, Marson had moved from Jamaica to London in the 1930s and was well known at the time as a BBC broadcaster, poet, playwright and anti-racist activist.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArchive at the British Library (link still broken after British Library cyber attack.)",

        "content": "Kate Walker Behan (1851–1918) was an American club leader, prominent in social, educational, and Confederate memorial affairs in the South for many years. She was president of the Confederated Memorial Association of the South, of the Ladies' Confederate Memorial Association of Louisiana, and first president of the Catholic Women's Club.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKate (\"Katie\") Walker, only child of Mr. and Mrs. William Walker, was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1851. She grew up in a wealthy home, with luxurious surroundings, in a cultured social circle to which the prominence of her parents introduced her.\nShortly after General Benjamin Butler took possession of the city of New Orleans, in 1862, she entered the Old Ursuline Convent to pursue her studies which had been interrupted by the start of the Civil War. She graduated in September 1865.\nEven in early childhood, she was active in the many departments of the Catholic Church work, a communicant of St. John's, a devout member of the Sodality of Our Lady, a helper of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, part of the Altar and Sanctuary Society.\nShe bore her full share of the burdens placed on the community by the Civil War and its eventualities, and continued her interest as the years passed.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile she lived in White Castle, she raised funds for the erection of the Church of Our Lady of Prompt Succor and for the beautifying of the edifice. She was prominent in the collection of money for the coronation at the Ursuline Convent of the Miraculous Statue of Our Lady of Prompt Succor. Upon the founding of the Ursuline Alumnæ, she became its first president, an office to which she was elected consecutively for many years. Her assistance was prompt when the Sisters of Charity found their duties increased by the newly founded Lepers' Home near White Castle. She was a chief promoter and organizer of the Catholic Women's Club, devoted to their interests, of which she was the first president. President also of the Ladies' Auxiliary of the House of the Good Shepherd, and member of St. Margaret's Daughters, she contributed to their good works. Her private charities were large.\nDuring the Civil War, while she was still a girl, she affiliated with the memorial societies of the 1860s, conducted by the women of the Confederacy. After the war, she continued her connection till all the associations were consolidated, and she was made president of the Confederated Southern Memorial Association, a position she held for many years thereafter. It was mainly through her efforts that the name of Jefferson Davis was restored to Cabin John Bridge in Washington, D.C., and the monument erected in this city to his memory.\nBehan was also identified with the United Daughters of the Confederacy. She helped secure money for the erection of the Jefferson Davis monument in Richmond, Virginia, and was instrumental in the organization of the Jefferson Davis Monument Association in New Orleans, whose progress she afterward directed as president, in 1906. Under the stimulus of her enthusiasm, the movement progressed rapidly and the monument was erected in Jefferson Davis Parkway (now, Norman C. Francis Parkway, the widest avenue in the U.S. She was largely instrumental in legislative action to make his birthday, June 3, a legal holiday, known as Confederate Memorial Day. Behan was an intimate friend of Varina Davis (Mrs. Jefferson Davis), Mary Anna Jackson (Mrs. Stonewall Jackson), and Mary Anna Custis Lee  (Mrs. Robert E. Lee). Behan was deeply interested in the passage of the bill in the Congress of the United States known as the \"Foraker Bill,\" which called for an appropriation of US$200,000, for the proper and perpetual care of the graves of the Confederate dead, who died in military hospitals and prisons, and were buried in Northern cemeteries.\nIn the general program of women's organizations and activities in New Orleans, Behan played a prominent part. She was chair of the home and education department of the Women's League in 1905 and conducted an educational campaign for the eradication of the yellow fever-bearing mosquito. She was zealous in work which might further her country's cause during World War I. As chair of Branch No. 8, of the New Orleans Chapter of the American Red Cross, she worked at making surgical dressings, garments, and knitted articles. She gave herself to drives to the point of exhaustion, that she wore herself out.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn 1865, just after the Civil War, she married General William J. Behan, with whom she resided for many years of their married life at Alhambra, White Castle, Louisiana, and in New Orleans. He served as Mayor of New Orleans. To them were born two daughters: Bessie (Behan) Lewis, and Katherine, who married André Dreux.\nAfter a brief illness, she died in New Orleans, July 28, 1918, age 71. The funeral ceremony occurred at Notre Dame de Bon Secour Church. Over her heart were pinned her medal of the Children of Mary, the purple badge of the Confederate Memorial Association, and a spray of flowers sent in a letter from her grandson, William Behan Dreux, in France.\nThose who knew Behan recognize as the testimonial they would like to give the words of Marie L. Points, editor of the Morning Star: \"No woman ever held the hearts of the women of New Orleans and of the South more truly than she did, and none ever left behind a sweeter or more gracious memory. She was honored in death as few were ever honored. The flags of the City Hall and of the Memorial Hall were at half-mast in her memory; crepe, for the first time in its history of over seventy years, was hung on the door of the Washington Artillery Armory, and the flag draped at half-mast in honor of a woman.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Travis Clayton (born 2001) is an English professional American football offensive tackle for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He played rugby union in England and joined the NFL as part of the International Player Pathway Program (IPPP), being selected in the seventh round of the 2024 NFL draft.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nClayton grew up in Basingstoke, Hampshire, in England. He played a number of sports growing up, including association football, rowing and boxing, before later focusing on rugby union. He played football as a member of the Fulham Academy and later had stints with Reading, Southampton and Chelsea. He later joined Basingstoke R.F.C., a team in the eighth tier of the English rugby union system.\n\n\n== American football career ==\nClayton had first tried out American football in 2019, spending time with the newly started NFL Academy in London, although he left the program soon after. Four years later, he decided to give the sport another shot. He rejoined the academy and after success there, was chosen in January 2024 as one of 16 participants in the National Football League's International Player Pathway Program (IPPP), designed to give international players more opportunities to play in the league.\nClayton spent ten weeks learning the sport while training at IMG Academy. He received praise for his pro day performance, measuring at 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) and 301 pounds (137 kg; 21.5 st) with a 7-foot (2.1 m) wingspan, while running the 40-yard dash in 4.79 seconds. His 40-yard dash time was better than any offensive lineman at the NFL Scouting Combine. He was invited to tryout with several teams and received comparisons to Jordan Mailata, an Australian rugby player who became a starter for the Philadelphia Eagles. Unlike other IPPP participants such as Louis Rees-Zammit, Clayton was eligible for the 2024 NFL draft due to being within four years of having graduated high school. Although never having played in a game of football before, he was chosen in the seventh round of the draft – 221st overall – by the Buffalo Bills, becoming the second-ever IPPP participant to be drafted after Mailata.\n\n\n== References ==",

It alters the lyrics of an English folk tune, \"The Jolly Ploughboy,\" about an Englishman who leaves behind the plough to join the British Army. \"The Merry Ploughboy\" is about an Irish farmer who joins the Irish Republican Army (IRA), and talks about going to Dublin in order to fight and retrieve \"the land the Saxon stole.\"\n\"The Merry Ploughboy (Off To Dublin In The Green)\" was released by Dermot O'Brien (who also played accordion on the track) in 1966 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising, with an arrangement by Dominic Behan, and was number one on the Irish Singles Chart for six weeks. Kevin Myers described it as \"one of the most influential songs of pre-Troubles Ireland.\" O'Brien confessed to being less comfortable with singing the song once the Troubles had begun, saying in 1975 \"at that time [1966] there was no trouble in the North and the record was a great hit. I am still asked to sing it, although I am completely against violence and don't think that sort of song goes well at the present moment.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Merry Ploughboy on YouTube",

        "content": "Diss Town Hall is a municipal building on Market Hill in Diss, Norfolk, a town in England.The building, which currently accommodates the offices of Diss Town Council, is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe complex has its origins in two houses constructed in the 18th century.  In around 1830 the two were united under the ownership of Thomas Leach, a local manufacturer of worsted and woollens. In about 1850, he redivided the property, and let one of the properties, No. 10, to his son-in-law, John Pennington, who was a wine salesman. After Leach died, probably in the 1870s, ownership passed to Pennington, who continued to live in No. 10, letting the other property, No. 11, to a local school mistress, Susan Dix. In 1887, Pennington sold both houses to a consortium of three property owners, who then let No. 11 to a pharmacist, John Cadge. In 1920, No. 11 was sold to a greengrocer, Albert James Cooper.\nAfter the local rural sanitary authority was succeeded by Diss Urban District Council in 1894, the new civic leaders established their offices at The Terrace in Diss. As the responsibilities of the council increased, it sought larger premises and, in 1938, the council decided to acquire both No. 10 and No. 11 Market Hill to accommodate a dedicated council chamber and municipal offices.\nThe building continued to serve in that capacity for much of the next four decades, but ceased to be the local seat of government when South Norfolk District Council was formed at Farthing Green House in Loddon in 1974. The building on Market Hill subsequently became the offices of Diss Town Council, although the town council held its meetings at the Corn Hall.\nThe council chamber continues to be used for public events.  In November 2012, a ceremony was held there during which the Royal Anglian Regiment received the Freedom of Diss.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe brick building has two storeys and an attic, with a pantiled roof.  Each floor has six windows, but the leftmost bay has been incorporated into the neighbouring building. There are two doors, one up stone steps with a wrought iron rail.  Each has a doorcase with a pediment. At roof level, there is a modillioned cornice. The right-hand section is fenestrated by two dormer windows at attic level. Internally, the principal room is the council chamber, which features exposed roof trusses and purlins. The building was grade II listed in 1950.\n\n\n== References ==",

He played college football for the Washington State Cougars and USC Trojans and was selected by the 49ers in the sixth round of the 2024 NFL draft.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKingston was born in and grew up in Northern California. He attended Anderson Union High School where he was a standout two-way lineman in football and also won a discus throw championship. He was called up from the junior varsity football team at age 15 and then helped the team reach the NSCIF Division III playoffs as a junior while being named first-team All-CIF Northern Section. He then earned All-NorCal honors as a senior. He committed to play college football for the Washington State Cougars as a three-star prospect.\n\n\n== College career ==\nKingston redshirted as a true freshman at Washington State in 2018, appearing in one game. He appeared in 10 games as a left guard during the 2019 season and then started all four games in the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season at the position. He started all 13 games in 2021, playing at left guard for the first 12 games before switching to left tackle in the final game of the year. Kingston started nine games in the 2022 season before missing the rest of the year due to injury; nonetheless he was chosen an honorable mention All-Pac-12 Conference selection.\nAlthough Kingston had considered entering the 2023 NFL draft prior to his injury, he opted to return for a final season in 2023 and transferred to the USC Trojans. He started 11-of-12 games for the Trojans while seeing action at both right tackle and right guard, allowing a total of four sacks.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nKingston was selected in the sixth round (215th overall) of the 2024 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\n== References ==",

However, in 2012, President José Mujica ordered the relocation of the mission, alleging high maintenance costs for the building. The functions of the embassy were transferred to the residence of the ambassador, while the consulate was installed in the building of the Buenos Aires branch of Banco de la República Oriental del Uruguay.\nSince June 19, 2018, the embassy and consulate general have operated in their current location, in a neoclassical building built in 1913. \n\n\n== Ambassador's residence ==\nThe residence of the Uruguayan ambassador to Argentina has been located in the Villa del Parque neighborhood since December 1948.

        "content": "The Victory for Change Party (VCP) is a political party in Liberia. It is a part of the Rainbow Alliance.\n\n\n== History ==\nMarcus Roland Jones was the founder of the VCP. He was a lawyer who attempted to run as an independent in the 2005 presidential election, though the National Elections Commission (NEC) blocked his candidacy in August, citing problems with his registration. By 2011, Jones was serving as the standard bearer for the VCP, and contested the presidency with Monica Dokie Borbor as his running mate. Jones received 5,305 votes, 0.4% of the total. In the 2011 legislative elections, the VCP had three candidates contest the Senate and fifteen contest the House of Representatives. None were elected.\nThe VCP had two candidates contesting the 2014 Senate elections. Neither were successful.\nIn October 2015, Foreign Minister Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan resigned from his post. He planned to contest the 2017 presidential election and was required to resign his post to comply with the National Code of Conduct. In April 2016, Ngafuan resigned from the Unity Party (UP). On October 22, 2016, Ngafuan, along with his supporters, joined the VCP. By November, there had been rumors circulating that Jones had sold the VCP's ticket to Ngafuan. Both Jones and Ngafuan denied the allegation. Jones further stated that Ngafuan was not qualified under the VCP's constitution to run for any position with the party, as he had joined the party too recently. VCP Chairman Emmanuel Tulay later stated there was no such qualification for candidates in the VCP's constitution. In May 2017, Ngafuan had stated that he was no longer seeking the presidency, not wanting to run against the UP candidate, Vice President Joseph Boakai. He gave his endorsement to Boakai. The VCP did not contest the presidency in 2017. By August 2017, Ngafuan had re-joined the UP.\nIn the 2017 House elections, the VCP ran 22 candidates. Johnson N. Gwaikolo won in Nimab's 9th House district. He was the only VCP candidate elected.\nIn May 2020, the VCP, along with 10 other political parties, signed a document to become part of the Rainbow Alliance (RA), with the goal of opposing the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) in the 2023 election. The RA was certified by the NEC on August 31, 2020, with the VCP as one of its 7 founding parties. The RA unsuccessfully contested the 2020 Senate elections with 10 candidates.\nBy June 2022, Rep. Gwaikolo had declared his intention to join the Congress for Democratic Change. Jones died in March 2023. The RA did not contest the 2023 presidential election and did not win any seats in the legislative elections. Gwaikolo contested re-election with the CDC in 2023 and was defeated.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Travis Centel Glover Jr. (born August 17, 2000) is an American football offensive tackle for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Georgia State Panthers and was selected by the Packers in the sixth round of the 2024 NFL draft.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGlover was born on August 17, 2000, and grew up in the small town of Vienna, Georgia. He attended Dooly County High School where he became a starting lineman as a junior, playing both ways. He was chosen to the Georgia Elite Classic all-star game that year and later was named first-team all-state and all-region as a senior, when he assisted in getting Dooly County to the second round of the state playoffs. Glover additionally played basketball and was a member of the track and field squad. He was ranked a three-star recruit and committed to play college football for the Georgia State Panthers.\n\n\n== College career ==\nGlover redshirted as a true freshman at Georgia State in 2018. The following year, he won the starting job and started all 13 games while being the second-ever Georgia State player chosen to the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) Shaun Alexander Freshman All-America team. After having been a right tackle during 2019, he moved to left tackle in 2020 and started all 10 games, then remained in that position and started all 13 games in 2021. He played at both right tackle and left guard during the 2022 season, starting nine of the 11 games he played in while missing another due to injury. He returned for a final season in 2023, having been granted an extra year of eligibility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He started all 12 games in 2023 and was chosen first-team All-Sun Belt Conference. He ended his collegiate career having totaled 57 starts, second in team history. He was invited to both the Hula Bowl and the 2024 Senior Bowl.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nGlover was selected in the sixth round (202nd overall) of the 2024 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGreen Bay Packers bio\nGeorgia State Panthers bio",

        "content": "The book Esh Kodesh (\"Holy Fire\") is a collection of sermons by the Rebbe of Piaseczno, Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, delivered to his followers in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Holocaust. This book serves as a unique Hasidic, theological-philosophical, and historical document.\n\n\n== Book Title ==\nThe author originally named it \"Innovations in Torah from the Years of Wrath 1939–1942\", but it was published under the name \"Esh Kodesh\" in Israel, memorializing the Holocaust martyrs, including the Rebbe and his family who were murdered during the Holocaust. The name Esh Kodesh (\"Holy Fire\") has been adopted for various Piaseczno Hasidic centers in Beit Shemesh and Bnei Brak, a yeshiva in Safed, a synagogue in New York, and the Esh Kodesh outpost in the Mateh Binyamin area.\n\n\n== Structure of the Book ==\nThe structure of \"Esh Kodesh\" is typical of books by Hasidic leaders: a collection of sermons on the weekly Torah portions and holidays, arranged according to the calendar year. The book contains 86 sermons delivered over three years, 1939–1942. The first sermon was given on Rosh Hashanah 1939 (September 14), and the last on Shabbat Chazon, July 18, 1942, just days before the mass deportation to Treblinka began. Additionally, there are corrections and notes added by the Rebbe, presumably after the last sermon.\nThe sermons are not consecutive throughout the three years; there are periods of several weeks or months without any. In the year 1939–1940, the Rebbe gave 41 sermons; in 1940–1941, only 21; and in 1941–1942, 24 sermons, up to Shabbat Chazon, covering four out of the five Books of Moses.\nThe sermons typically begin with a question about the weekly Torah portion, referencing commentators or related Midrashim. Often, there is mention of Rashi's commentary and the Midrash, usually Midrash Rabbah. There are also many references to the Zohar and various Hasidic works, especially those written by his father.\n\n\n== Content of the Book ==\nAs a Hasidic leader during the Holocaust, the Rebbe faced enormous theological and philosophical challenges. \"Holy Fire\" represents a unique attempt to offer Hasidic-thought responses to the difficulty: as a Rebbe and a thinker, he tries to justify the actions of the Creator, find a compromise for suffering, and imbue meaning in sanctifying God's name; as a leader, he tries to encourage his listeners and provide direction to his followers.\nThe exceptional intellectual effort invested in the book, under dire conditions, makes it an extraordinary Hasidic, theological-philosophical, and historical document. Rabbi Shapira poignantly describes the immense suffering he and his followers endured. His religious questions and attempts to cope with the immense physical and spiritual hardship create a nearly unparalleled religious-historical document\n\n\n== Discovery of the Writings After the Holocaust ==\nSometime between the deportation to Treblinka and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, after which the Rebbe was murdered in Trawniki, he handed the manuscript to a member of the Oyneg Shabbos Archive. The manuscript was buried in a milk jug in the ghetto soil, along with other documents collected by the underground archive members. The pages were discovered in Poland a few years after the war by a worker during foundation laying for a new building in Warsaw on the ruins of the ghetto, and they were handed over to the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw.\nIn 1957, the pages were identified, and copies were sent by Baruch Dubdevani to the Piaseczno Hasidim in Israel. This was done following a request from the Piaseczno Hasidim to check if he could obtain the writings. In the foreword to the book, Baruch Dubdevani describes how he stumbled upon the letter from the Rebbe asking his brother, Rabbi Yeshayahu Shapira, and his friends in Israel to publish his writings. Dubdevani saw the discovery of the letter as a \"holy will\" and decided to find the writings come what may. Indeed, he managed to find them. Letters from the Rebbe of Piaseczno to the finder of the writings and to his friends in Israel are also printed at the beginning of the book.\nThe collection of sermons was published under the name \"Holy Fire\" for the first time in 1960 by the Committee of Piaseczno Hasidim. Since then, the book has been printed in several editions.\nIn 2017, a scholarly revised edition titled \"Sermons from the Years of Wrath\" was published in two volumes. This edition was edited based on the original manuscript found in the Ringelblum Archive at the Jewish Historical Institute in Poland. The first volume includes the revised sermons with added source references and explanations. The second volume contains a facsimile edition where, alongside a color photograph of the manuscript, an accurate transcription in four colors (black, red, blue, and green) distinguishes between different layers of revisions made by the author.\nThe pages themselves, written by the Rebbe, are located, along with the entire \"Oyneg Shabbos\" archive of Ringelblum, in the governmental archive of the Polish government.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDaniel Reiser (Editor), Kalonymus Kalman Shapira (Author), \"Sermons from the Years of Wrath: A Precise Edition Based on the Manuscript\", Jerusalem, 2017, in two volumes.\nYitzhak Hershkowitz, \"Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira of Piaseczno: Holocaust Theology versus Pre-Holocaust Thought, Continuation or Transformation?\", Master's Thesis, Bar-Ilan University, 2005.\nRon Wax, \"The Blaze of Holy Fire: Gateways to the Teachings of the Rebbe of Piaseczno\", Tavunot Press, Herzog College, Alon Shvut, 2010 (360 pages).\nMendel Piekarz, \"The Last Hasidic Literary Document from Polish Soil\", Yad Vashem Publications, Jerusalem, 1979.\nEsther Farbstein, \"In the Shadow of Thunder: Halacha, Thought, and Leadership during the Holocaust\", Rabbi Kook Institute, 2002, Chapter Twelve \"The Voice of God in Fire - Sermons of the Rebbe of Piaseczno in the Warsaw Ghetto\".\nRabbi Gershon Kitsis, \"Rabbi Kalonymus of Piaseczno: A Conversation with His Legacy\", Machanayim: A Quarterly for Research, Thought, and Jewish Culture 8, Center for Sefir Culture and Jewish Education, Kislev 1995, pp. 132-139.\nEliezer Shvid, \"Between Destruction and Salvation – Responses of Ultra-Orthodox Thought to the Holocaust\", Kibbutz HaMeuchad Publishing House, 1994.\nPesach Schindler, \"Holocaust and Spiritual Despair\", Studies in the Holocaust Period, a collection of essays in memory of Meir Dvorjetski, edited by Mordechai Eliav, Bar-Ilan University Press, Ramat Gan, 1979, pp. 55-65.\nPesach Schindler, \"The Response of Hasidism to the Holocaust\", Faith in the Holocaust, Ministry of Education and Culture, Department of Torah Culture, Jerusalem, 1980, pp. 69-78.\nDr. Ofer Schiff: \"A Model of Hasidic Leadership during the Holocaust\", Machanayim, a Quarterly for Research, Thought, and Jewish Culture, Issue No. 8, Center for Sefir Culture and Jewish Education, Kislev 1995, pp. 122-131.\nEsther Judith Teidor Baumel, \"Holy Fire\", Rabbi Kalman Shapira of Piaseczno's Book and its Role in Understanding Religious Life in the Warsaw Ghetto\", Yalkut Moreshet, Journal for Documentation and Study, Issue 29, Nisan 1980, May, pp. 173-187.\nNehemia Polen, \"The Holy Fire\", Jason Aronson Inc., Northvale, New Jersey; London, 1994.\n\n\n== References ==",

One to seven players can play, and the game features many different levels of play.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDave Arneson reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"For the same enjoyment, and less effort, one could play Avalon Hill's Galaxy on an old Apple II. By comparison, Star-King lacks the user-friendly features, entertaining sound effects, crude animation (in the results phases) and a fairly exciting play system for multi-player action that Galaxy had over ten years ago. When one considers that Galaxy was even written for a 30K machine, that makes Star-King a solid miss in this market, unless one simply must have a multi-player modem game with a steep learning curve.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

He played college football for the Oregon Ducks and was selected by the Texans in the sixth round of the 2024 NFL draft.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHill was born on April 4, 2001, and grew up in Rex, Georgia. He was raised by his mother after his father died when Hill was five years old. He attended Morrow High School where he won three varsity letters on the football team while playing safety. He was chosen first-team all-region both as a junior and senior and also was an all-county choice. He committed to play college football for the Oregon Ducks, having been ranked a three-star recruit, the 38th-best safety nationally and the 44th-best player in the state.\n\n\n== College career ==\nHill played mainly on special teams as a true freshman at Oregon in 2019, totaling six tackles. He then started all six games in 2020, recording 20 tackles, four pass breakups and two interceptions; both of his interceptions came in the Ducks' Pac-12 Conference championship game win against USC, and he was named the conference player of the week for his performance.

He previously played for the North Carolina Tar Heels and Louisville Cardinals.\n\n\n== Early life and high school ==\nDuck was named after Storm Logan, a character on the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. He grew up in Greenville, South Carolina, and moved to Spartanburg when he was seven. He played three years as a starting cornerback at Boiling Springs High School. In the state playoff semifinals as a sophomore, he intercepted a would-be game-winning touchdown and broke up a similar two-point conversion to put his team in the title game. He was a three-star recruit in the class of 2019 and committed to North Carolina over offers from Appalachian State, Army, Campbell, and Charleston Southern.\n\n\n== College career ==\nDuck made his first start for North Carolina on September 28, 2019, against No. Clemson, and made 13 appearances with 9 starts as a freshman. He missed much of the next two seasons due to injury. In the 2022 season, he led the Tar Heels in interceptions and passes defended and was named to the All-ACC second team. He then transferred to Louisville after initially committing to Penn State.\n\n\n== NFL career ==\n\nDuck signed as an undrafted free agent with the Miami Dolphins on April 27, 2024.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLouisville Cardinals bio",

The series was created by Irna Phillips and debuted on radio in 1937. The story follows on doctor Jim Brent and his wife Jocelyn played by Don MacLaughlin and Virginia Dwyer in a small town in Merrimack County, New Hampshire.\nBecause many CBS affiliates choose to run local news and talk shows during The Road of Life time slot, it never achieved the popularity and was canceled after single season. However the radio version of series continued to 1959.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nDon MacLaughlin as Dr. Jim Brent\nVirginia Dwyer as Jocelyn Brent\nCharles Dingle as Conrad Overton\nBarbara Becker as Sybil Overton Fuller\nHarry Holcombe as Malcolm Overton\nElizabeth Lawrence as Francie Brent\nJohn Larkin as Frank Dana #1\nChuck Webster as Frank Dana #2\nJack Lemmon as Surgeon\nDorothy Sands as Reggie Ellis\nBill Lipton as John Brent\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of radio soaps\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Road of Life at IMDb",

        "content": "The Zamość Ghetto was a Jewish ghetto created by Nazi Germany in the city of Zamość, Lublin province, Poland in spring 1941 and was liquidated in October 1942 when the remaining inhabitants were deported to the Belzec extermination camp.\n\n\n== Background ==\nZamość, in western Poland, was part of the Lublin district during World War II. The district comprised over 1,660 communities with more than half a million people. The Jews of the district primarily lived in towns and in the district city of Zamość, where they made up about half of the population.\n\n\n== Establishment ==\nImmediately after the conquest of Poland in September 1939, Jews were conscripted for forced labor. In December 1939, the German occupiers ordered the Jews of the city to establish a Judenrat, which included 12 members. The initial chairperson was Ben Zion Lubliner. In January 1940, Mieczyslaw Garfinkel replaced Lubliner. Many Jews from the city fled to the Soviet Union and to areas conquered by it in Poland, leaving about half of the 10,000 Jews in the city. These were the individuals who were confined to the ghetto upon its establishment in spring 1941, along with about a thousand Jews expelled from western Polish areas annexed by Germany. (known as \"Warthegau\")\n\n\n== Transports ==\nIn spring 1941, the Jews were concentrated in one of the poorest areas of the city. Initially, the area was not fenced, and the Jews were allowed to enter and exit, but only for limited periods each day. On April 1, 1942, the first transport departed as part of Operation Reinhardt. On April 11, a transport departed carrying 3,000 Jews to their deaths in Belzec. On May 1, 1942, about a thousand Jews were deported from North Rhine-Westphalia through the Dortmund train station to the Zamość Ghetto.\nFrom October 16 to 18, 1942, the ghetto was liquidated and its inhabitants were sent to be exterminated in Belzec. A few hundred forced laborers remained in the former ghetto area to clean it up and sort the belongings of the murdered for German use.\n\n\n== Labor Camp ==\nOn November 12, 1942, the Zamość area was declared a special settlement area of the General Government for Germans. The inhabitants of the Polish villages in the area were evacuated, and part of the former ghetto area served as a temporary transit camp.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRemember Jewish Zamość\nZamość, Poland at JewishGen",

She was 27 years old. Footage of her death was caught on a surveillance camera. Authenticity of the 44 second video was confirmed by a Baghdad police source. Iraq's Interior Minister announced that an investigation into her death would be launched. \nHer death was one in a series of violent deaths of social media influencers in Iraq, including that in September 2023 of Noor Alsaffar (Noor BM).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Helena Agnieszka Kmieć (9 February 1991 – 24 January 2017) was a Polish Roman Catholic missionary, awarded the Gold Cross of Merit, in 2024, her beatification process began.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHelena Agnieszka Kmieć was born on 9 February 1991 in Kraków. She graduated from the High School of the Catholic Association of Educators in Libiąż. She was a scholarship holder of the Leweston School in Sherborne, UK, where she obtained her high school diploma, at the same time pursuing an individual course of study in her high school, from which she graduated in 2009. In 2014, she obtained a master's degree in engineering at the Faculty of Chemistry of the Silesian University of Technology, where she studied technology and chemical engineering in English. After graduating, she worked as a flight attendant for an airline.\nShe was active in the academic chaplaincy in Gliwice and sang in the Academic Choir of the Silesian University of Technology. Since 2012, she has been a volunteer as part of the Missionary Volunteer Service \"Salvator\" in Trzebinia. She organized day camps for children at the parishes of the Salvatorian Fathers in Galgahévíz, Hungary and in Timișoara, Romania. On Friday, 6 July 2012, as part of the evangelization at the railway station in Wrocław, she sang Listen, Israel, the Lord is your God, the Lord is the only one. In 2013, during the missions in Zambia, she worked with children and young people at the Salvation Home center in Lusaka and at the Kulanga Bana Farm youth center in Chamulimba (a village in Chongwe District). During the World Youth Day in Poland, she was their coordinator in the parish of St. Barbara in her hometown of Libiąż.\nOn 8 January 2017, together with Anita Szuwald, she went on a mission to Bolivia, where she planned to help the Servant Sisters of Dębica in the orphanage in Cochabamba until June. She died on the night of 24/25 January 2017, stabbed during an assault on the facility. In March 2018, a Bolivian court sentenced her killer, Romualdo Mamio dos Santos, to 30 years in prison.\nBy the decision of the President of Poland of 7 February 2017, she was posthumously awarded the Gold Cross of Merit for her merits in charitable and social activities and her commitment to people in need of help.\nHer funeral ceremonies began on 18 February 2017 at the Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima in Trzebinia, and on February 19 they continued in her hometown of Libiąż. The Holy Mass preceding the funeral was presided over by Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz. The funeral ceremony was of a state character. Helena Kmasz was buried in the cemetery at the parish church of St. Barbara in Libiąż.\n\n\n== The Beatification Process ==\nIn December 2022, the Archdiocese of Kraków announced the start of the beatification process for Helena Kmieć, and in April 2024, an edict was issued announcing the official start of the process of beatification of the Polish missionary. The beatification process of Helena will begin on 10 May 2024 in the Chapel of the Palace of the Archbishops of Kraków and from that moment she will be entitled to the title of Servant of God.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Delaware Mock Trial Competition is a high school Mock Trial competition in Delaware sponsored by the Delaware Law Related Education Center (or DelREC). The winning school of the state finals advances to the National High School Mock Trial Championship. The Delaware Mock Trial Competition was established in 1991, with it's first competition being held in 1992. The case material is usually released early in November and the competition takes place on the last Friday and Saturday in February at the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center in Wilmington, Delaware. Typically, between 20 and 24 teams compete each year, drawing from traditional public schools, charter schools, private schools, catholic schools, and civic organizations from across the state.  As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the 2021 and 2022 competition seasons were held virtually.\nDelaware has been the host site of the National High School Mock Trial Championship twice in 2008 and 2024.\n\n\n== Trial Format ==\n\n\n=== Opening Statements ===\nA trial starts with a 5-minute opening statement by the Plaintiff/Prosecution (depending on whether the case is civil or criminal, respectively), which is immediately followed by a 5-minute opening statement by the defense.\n\n\n=== Witness Testimony ===\nAfter opening statements, the plaintiff/prosecution calls its first witness. The plaintiff/prosecution conducts a direct examination of the witness, and then defense conducts a cross examination of the same witness. After cross-examination, plaintiff/prosecution has the opportunity to conduct a redirect examination of the witness. If they do, defense is given the chance to recross the witness. After either all four types of exams have been conducted or one party abstains from doing redirect or recross respectively, the witness steps down from the stand. This process is then repeated for two more plaintiff/prosecution witnesses. With the conclusion of testimony from the third plaintiff witness, the plaintiff rests. The Defense then calls three witnesses in the same manner described above for the plaintiff/prosecution.\nEach team has 45 minutes for witness testimony with 25 minutes designated for direct examination and 20 minutes designated for cross examination (including redirects and recrosses conducted by counsel of that team). The clock does stop, however, for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, objections and parts of the process for entering exhibits.)\n\n\n=== Closing Arguments ===\nOnce the third defense witness has finished giving testimony, the plaintiff/prosecution gives gives their closing argument. Like opening statements, closing arguments are limited to 5 minutes apiece. After plaintiff/prosecution closes, the defense gives its closing statement. After the defense goes, the plaintiff/prosecution has a chance to provide a rebuttal that is limited to the scope of the defendant's closing statement if time allows., after which the plaintiff/prosecution may offer a rebuttal.  Barring any disputes being raised, this marks the conclusion of the trial, and the jury is dismissed to tally points.\n\n\n=== Scoring & Winner ===\nEach member of the jury scores each part of the trial based on specific scoring categories, such as the flow of a direct examination or the effectiveness of a cross-examination. Each opening statement or closing argument is worth a maximum of 10 points. Each direct or cross-examination is also worth, at most, 10 points. Each witness can earn a maximum of 10 points independent of any other points from direct examination. There is one team evaluation category scored at the end of the trial, which serves as a tiebreaker. Therefore, each team can earn up to 110 points during the trial.\nOn any juror's ballot, the team with more points is the winner of that scoresheet. Each scoresheet is worth one vote or \"ballot\". Whichever team receives more ballots is declared the winner of the trial.\n\n\n== Past Cases ==\n\nWhen Delaware has hosted the National High School Mock Trial Championship, they used the following cases:\n\n\n== State Finals Results ==\n\nNote #1 - Second place team attended National Tournament instead of state champion (2018)\nNote #2 - Second place team qualified for National Tournament as Host Alternate Team (2024)\n\n\n== Delaware Way Award Winners ==\nThe Delaware Way award is given each year to the team that the best exemplifies the ideals of mock trial – civility, justice, and fair play.\n\n\n== Courtroom Artist, Courtroom Journalist, and Mock Trial Essay Winners ==\nThe artist and journalist competitions take place in the third round of the competition. The courtroom artist has to sketch during the trial and provide their work at the conclusion of the round.  The courtroom journalist watched the trial and then has two hours to write a 800-word (or less) article on the proceedings.  The Courtroom Artist contest was started in 2019 and the Courtroom Reporter contest was started in 2022.  Due to the virtual nature of the competition in 2021 and 2022, the Courtroom Artist contest was not held.\nFor the Mock Trial Essay, seniors were given the prompt \"How Has the Delaware High School Mock Trial Program Helped\nPrepare You to Become a More Effective Citizen?\" prior to the competition and tasked with writing an essay between 500 and 1000 words.  GE sponsored the award in 2016 and 2017 and Anthony Iannini sponsored it through 2020.\n\n\n== Schools with State Finals Appearances ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDelaware High School Mock Trial",

        "content": "Sunlight before signing refers to an open government campaign pledge made during the Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign to make non-emergency bills freely available online for a five-day public comment period prior to signing. As a 2008 presidential candidate, the initiative was part of the package of transparent government reforms that  Obama advocated for. The phrase stems from a quote by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis that \"Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.\" The pledge was initially made in Manchester, NH on June 22, 2007. The initiative was well-received, but was found to have inconsistent follow-though.\nThe Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first bill signed into law by U.S. President Barack Obama following his first week in office on January 29, 2009, and was not posted until after the signing. The lack of delay for the initial presidency was attributed in part to trying to build political momentum. A review by the Cato Institute found that approximately 62% of non-emergency bills during the first term of the presidency of Barack Obama met the sunlight before sunshine pledge.\n\nThough the promise was well-intentioned, it's implementation as-is would have limited impact as commenting on a passed bill is largely meaningless. As such, there was an effort to get bills posted online, earlier in the process. In 2009, when a congressional bill passed, a link would be posted to the Library of Congress. There were a number of technical hurdles that had to be overcome to make it feasible. Initially, links were posted on orphaned subpages of Whitehouse.gov domain, only accessible via the website's internal search engine and  not discoverable via the sitemap or an external search engine, thus rendering them inaccessible.\nA 2008 campaign brochure described the Sunlight Before Signing imitative as follows:\n\nToo often bills are rushed through Congress and to the president before the public has the opportunity to review them. As president, Barack Obama will not sign any non-emergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and give input on the White House website for five days. In addition to ensuring that the public has the ability to review legislation, the sunlight will help ensure that earmarks tucked into appropriations bills are exposed. And Obama will sign legislation in the light of day without attaching signing statements that undermine the legislative intent.\nIn light of the lack of consistent implementation, the Sunlight Foundation also sought for 72-hour hold as part of its Read the Bill process reform initiative.\n\nIn May 2009, the website Data.gov was launched as part of the open government initiative. Obama's focus on open government led to an increased interest in civic technology.\n\n\n== See also ==\neRulemaking\nRegulations.gov\nSunlight Foundation\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Antonio de Arteche Villabaso (8 January 1880 – 26 January 1962) was a Spanish lawyer and politician. He was a deputy for Burgos between 1905 and 1918, and again between 1921 and 1923.\nHe was the first Marquis of Buniel, a noble title that he held from 1916 until 1962. He was the younger brother of Julio, the first Count of Arteche, deputy to the Cortes in 1923, and president for life of Banco de Bilbao (1942–1960).\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nAntonio de Arteche was born on 8 January 1880 in Bilbao, as the son of Juan Antonio Villabaso Uribarri and María Jesús Gorrita Echavarri. On 12 October 1901, he married Gertrudis Ortiz de la Riva, and the couple had four children, María de la Paz, the twins Luis María and Juan Cruz, and María del Pilar de Arteche y Ortiz de la Riva.\nAt some point, he and his family acquired the Palacio Horcasitas, where they lived. Arteche was one of the last owners of the Arana Tower house located on street Arane.\n\n\n== Politic career ==\nArteche premiered as a deputy in the Cortes for Burgos in the 1905 Spanish general election as a liberal, and held this position until 10 January 1918, and again between 19 December 1920 and 15 September 1923, this time with the liberal left. He also held the secretariat and vice presidency of the chamber of the Congress of Deputies.\nArteche was an open-minded man who treasured publications that \"could have brought political problems to any family outside the noble sphere\", such as texts on minutes of Senate sessions, foreign policy, architecture, law, sexual education \"and a thousand other topics that give us a vision of the polarization of interwar Europe\".\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nIn 1902, the 24-year-old Arteche and his older brother Julio were among the members of Sporting Club de Bilbao, being the no. 25 and 26 respectively.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nOn 18 March 1916, King Alfonso XIII granted him the aristocratic title of Marquis of Buniel by royal decree and dispatch issued on 27 May of the same year. Following his death in Bilbao on 26 January 1962, he was succeeded by his son Juan Cruz (1908–1973) on 30 March 1964 in a letter dated 11 January, who thus became the second Marquis of Buniel. His first-born son Luis María (1908–1991) renounced the title. He studied abroad and enjoyed summers in Balmaseda. In the Spanish Civil War, he was tasked with digging trenches on the battlefield.\nArteche was also awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabel the Catholic.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Julio Francisco Domingo de Arteche y Villabaso (4 August 1878 – 12 July 1960) was a Spanish businessman and banker who served as the first non-rotating president of the Banco de Bilbao.\nHe was a prominent businessman although he maintained a certain political activity in the early 1920s, being a deputy for Markina in 1923. At the age of 25, he was appointed as a director of Banco Bilbao, and remained link to it for six decades and from there to a multitude of companies. Among other things, he was the president of the administrative councils of ten companies and companies and the vice-president of three others.\nHe was the first Count of Arteche between 1950 and 1963. He was the brother of Antonio, the first Marquis of Buniel, deputy to the Cortes between 1905 and 1923 for Burgos.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nJulio de Arteche was born on 4 August 1878 on Luchana Street in Bilbao, as the son of José Maria de Arteche y Osante, a liberal politician from Biscay, and Maria Elisa Villabaso Gorrita, the sister of José Luis de Villabaso Gorrita.\nIn 1902, Arteche married Magdalena Olábarri y Zubiría (1881–1969), daughter of José María Olábarri Massino, a member of one of the founding families of the Santa Ana de Bolueta steel company, and Manuela Zubiría e Ybarra, belonging to the powerful and influential Ybarra family group. The couple settled in Las Arenas and had six children: Magdalena, José María, María Victoria, Teresa, Isabel, and Francisco Javier.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== First projects ===\nAfter completing his secondary education studies, Arteche began his higher education in 1894 at the University of Deusto, where he performed engineering studies. He planned to become an industrial engineer, but abandoned his studies when he was just three classes short of a degree after being appointed as the Director of the Banco de Bilbao in 1903, at 25 years of age, thus being the youngest member of the board. He got this position mainly thanks to the influence of his uncle José Luis, who had been the managing director of Banco del Comercio before becoming the chief executive officer (CEO) of Banco de Bilbao. He entered the board of the Banco de Bilbao on 31 December 1903 and remained there throughout his entire professional career and for the rest of his life until he died, except for a brief period in which the Basque Government of José Antonio Aguirre relieved the directors of their positions.\nThe first time that Arteche achieved notoriety was on the occasion of the First World War, when he was the president of the Agrupación de Sociedades Anónimas del Norte de España organization, taking an effective position in the decisions of the serious problems that arose after the war on the extraordinary profits and the change in fiscal taxes.\nBetween 1918 and 1920, Arteche took part in some of the main business initiatives of the Banco de Bilbao in those years. For instance, once the war was over, he participated in the process of its internationalization by collecting the assets of the former Mildred & Goyeneche house in London and repurposed it as the Bank's branch in London. He also had a prominent role in the process of nationalization of the securities of the large Spanish railway companies, which in Bilbao acquired particular importance due to the interest among local businessmen in improving the port's communication routes with the interior of the Iberian Peninsula. As a result of this process, an important part of the capital of the Compañía de los Caminos de Hierro del Norte de España (Norte) passed into Bilbao hands and several local businessmen joined its Board of Directors, including Arteche, who was representing the interests of the Banco de Bilbao. Both he and his uncle played a very active role in Consortium of Saltos del Duero and the Sociedad Hispano-Portuguesa de Transportes Eléctricos, two companies launched by the Banco de Bilbao to carry out the necessary procedures and works with which the most important hydroelectric business of the moment would be launched: the Saltos do Douro.\nAt the beginning of the 1920s, the figure of Julio de Arteche was consolidated within the Board of the Banco de Bilbao, and he combined his position there with his membership on the boards of this bank and its subsidiary, Banco del Comercio, and that of the Compañía de Ferrocarriles del Norte, Arteche was president of the Hispano-Portuguesa de Transportes Eléctricos and the director of such representative companies of the Biscayan economy, such as Papelera Española, Compañía Marítima del Nervión, Alambres de Cadagua, and Compañía de los Ferrocarriles de Santander a Bilbao.\n\n\n=== President of Banco de Bilbao ===\nIn January 1941, during a critical period in which Banco de Bilbao needed to adapt to the complicated circumstances in which Spain found itself after the Spanish Civil War and also to strict government measures, the then CEO José Manuel Figueras resigned and Víctor Artola was appointed as his successor, and in the following year, on 31 January 1942, in the first Annual General Meeting since 1936, the General shareholders approved the reform of the entity's statutes, with the most important change being to set aside the tradition of rotating the chairmanship of the board of directors on an annual basis and then unanimously appointed the 64-year-old Arteche as its first permanent president, abandoning the rotating nature that this position had until then. The professional partnership of Artola as CEO and Arteche as chairman was decisive in allowing Banco de Bilbao to successfully negotiate the difficult years of the 1940s, and together, they turned the bank into an entity with a national presence without sacrificing international ambitions. From the moment he became chairman, Arteche's activity was marked by the modernization that he introduced in the Banco de Bilbao and by the effective participation that he and the entity he presided had in a good number of companies in very diverse productive sectors.\nRegarding the first aspect, Arteche piloted the modernization of the Bank of Bilbao, creating its central administration in the 1940s and opening its foreign service in 1945, while developing a territorial network of offices throughout Spain. Regarding the second aspect, he promoted and undertook the development of economic sectors of the first magnitude, becoming the president of such relevant companies as Iberduero, Nitratos de Castilla, La Papelera Española, Cellophane Española, Constructora Nacional de Maquinaria Eléctrica, and the Spanish Society of Electromechanical Constructions (SECEM). In this last task, Arteche, like so many other representatives of private business interests, had to confront the statist policy promoted by Juan Antonio Suanzes during his first stage at the head of the Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI), seeking to make compatible the private interests that it represented with the actions of the public institute.\nArteche was also a member of the Board of the Bank of Spain as a representative of the Superior Banking Council, and held the vice presidency of two large companies located in two strategic sectors: communications and automotive: the National Telephone Company of Spain (Telefónica) and the Spanish Society of Touring Cars (Spanish: Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo, SEAT). He also served as a director in Naviera Vizcaina, Aeronautical Construction Association, Minas Riotinto company, and the Asturian Bank for Industry and Commerce.\nThose who knew him emphasized his great ability to maintain relationships and his fine diplomatic skills. His economic and financial contribution from business management positions resulted in his permanence in the governing bodies of the Banco de Bilbao for 56 years (1903–1960), more than half a century of a life that lasted for 81 years, and was reflected in the ideal of its business work: continuous development, the constant search for economic modernity.\n\n\n== Outside of business ==\nTo his business personality, the Count of Arteche added social, literary, cultural, religious, and political concerns that offer a more complete dimension of his person. In his cultural aspect, his participation in the Bilbao gathering of the Golden Lion with local personalities such as Dr. Areilza and Julio Eguileor stood out. His activities in museum boards and cultural works in his surroundings were also known.\nHis faith in Christianity, on the other hand, manifested itself in the form of a special pious work, highlighting his visits to the monastery of Silos, whose maintenance he generously supported. He was even distinguished with the grand cross of the Royal Order of Isabella the Catholic.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nIn 1902, the 24-year-old Arteche and his younger brother Antonio were among the members of Sporting Club de Bilbao, being the no. 25 and 26 respectively. His love for recreational boating, hunting, and shooting was evident.\n\n\n== Politic career ==\nIn the 1923 Spanish general elections for deputies to the Cortes on 30 April 1923, Arteche presented himself as a candidate for the Monarchist League in the district of Markina in Biscay, which he won, but his political work was cut short on the following 12 September following the coup d'état by Primo de Rivera.\n\n\n== Noble title and death ==\nOn 18 July 1950, the Spanish State of Francisco Franco, in recognition of his work, granted him the aristocratic title of Count of Arteche because \"with his effort and intelligence has been working tirelessly for the growth of the industry and the national economy\". At 70 years of age, he returned to school and completed the three courses that he had put on hold at age 25, thus becoming an engineer while in his 70s, which gives an idea of his firm character.\nArteche held both the noble title and the chairmanship of Banco de Bilbao until he died at his home in Las Arenas, Getxo on 12 July 1960, just before his 82nd birthday. His mortal remains were buried in Balmaseda. He was succeeded in the Banco de Bilbao by Gervasio Collar y Luis and in his noble title by his son José María de Arteche y Olabarri in a letter dated 22 March 1963, who thus became the second Count of Arteche.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nTwo days after his death, the local press reported on the posthumous awarding of the Gold Medal of Vizcaya and the Town of Bilbao, announcing that a street or town would be named after him, and in fact, this square is still visible today in a small avenue in the Conde de Arteche, located at one of the links of Bilbao's Gran Vía with the Doña Casilda Iturrizar Park, a short distance from the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The NBV21 is an ecumenical Dutch-language Bible translation, created by the Dutch-Flemish Bible Society (Dutch: Nederlands-Vlaams Bijbelgenootschap; NBG) and published in 2021. The NBV21 is a revised version of the New Bible Translation (Nieuwe Bijbelvertaling; NBV) of 2004. In comparison to the NBV, around 12,000 edits were made to the NBV21. A major difference to was the implementation of highly-requested reverential capitalization. Additional reactions of readers to the previous version were also taken into account.\nA revision of the NBV was announced in 2009, before being published on 13 October 2021. The first printed copy was presented to King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, and additional copies were sent to 12 leaders of various religious communities.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1967, the Council for Contact and Deliberation regarding the Bible (Raad voor Contact en Overleg betreffende de Bijbel; RCOB) was founded as an ecumenical platform to facilitate communication between the Dutch Bible Society (Nederlands Bijbelgenootschap; NBG) and the Catholic Bible Foundation (Katholieke Bijbelstichting; KBS) regarding translation and use of the Bible. After an abandoned and incomplete translation attempt in 1969, the RCOB's first complete effort towards an ecumenical translation of the Bible into Dutch started with the Great News Bible, produced in 1983 and written in vernacular Dutch. However, this translation was deemed insufficient for liturgical use. In 1989, the RCOB declared again the intention to work towards a common Bible translation. The process of translation began in 1993, resulting in the New Bible Translation of 2004. The NBV became one of the standard Bibles of many Protestant churches in the Netherlands, however traditional Reformed churches continued using the States Translation of 1637. In addition, the NBV was heavily criticized for forgoing reverential capitalization.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2009, the NBG and KBS declared a revision of this translation, whereby criticism of the NBV would be addressed. In 2016, the Dutch Bible Society began work on the revised translation. The method of translation remained the same, but the NBV21 was tightened and adjusted on certain points compared to the NBV. Nevertheless, edits were performed on almost every page, amounting to a total of around 12,000 edits in comparison to the NBV. According to the foreword of the NBV21, the rationale for the revision originated in suggestions and reactions from readers to the NBV which the society received through emails and letters. In October 2020, the name NBV21 was announced, with the number representing the idea of being the standard translation for readers in the 21st century. The process of translation was finished by early 2021, and the book was released on 13 October 2021. The first printed copy was presented to King Willem-Alexander, a patron of the Dutch-Flemish Bible Society. Copies of the NBV21 were then sent to twelve representatives of various churches and religious communities.\n\n\n== Method of revision ==\n\n\n=== Concerns ===\nSeveral small errors in the translation of the NBV were corrected in the NBV21. In some instances, the Dutch grammar was improved. The translation was also adjusted to remain in accordance with scientific findings, while the core of the revision consisted of a slight adjustment of the NBV across the board. In addition, the reactions of readers' wishes were taken into account. Their wishes were converted into the four revisional principles:\n\nMore consistency: more alignment between texts which are cross-referenced. This includes fixed formulas, casual similarities, allusions and quotations.\nFunctional concordance: making functional word repetitions, such as motifs, more visible in translation without detracting from the Dutch language.\nScientific support: proposals for translation, including those made by readers, were tested for scientific support.\nLess insertion of interpretation: interpretations on the part of the translators have been minimized and texts have been translated more openly when appropriate.\n\n\n=== Reverential capitalization ===\nA notable change in the NBV21 is the implementation of reverential capitalization of personal pronouns which refer to God, Jesus, or the Holy Ghost, which was the most requested change from readers. The main argument against reverential capitalization was that its usage would disappear in language, however the argument did not prove to be tenable as its usage continued. The usage of reverential capitalization in the NBV21 is more austere than, for example, is found in the Herziene Statenvertaling (HSV): the NBV21 only capitalizes personal pronouns, while the HSV also capitalizes possessives, among other words. The former is in line with the NBG Translation and the Willibrord translation.\n\n\n=== Process ===\nLike the NBV, the NBV21 was processed through pairs of translators. The first groups of translators made proposals for revision, which were reviewed by the second groups. Then there was input from the translation coordinator, the guidance committee and finally the redactors. \n\n\n== Translation ==\n\n\n=== Source texts ===\nThe textual basis of the Old Testament consists primarily of the Biblia Hebraica Quinta (BHQ). However, since the BHQ was still incomplete during the production of the NBV21, the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia is relied upon as a secondary basis. Footnotes shed light on deviant translations found in the texts of the Aleppo Codex, Aquila's translation, Vulgate, Peshitta, Dead Sea Scrolls, Göttingen Septuagint, Symmachus' translation, Targum, Theodotion's translation, and Vetus Latina. The basis of the Deuterocanon is primarily the Göttingen Septuagint, while textual deviants are included in footnotes under \"other manuscripts\". Hebrew and Aramaic precursors to the Septuagint are preferred when the Septuagint does not provide a meaningful text. Modern reconstructions of lost Hebrew text are also noted. The primary basis of the New Testament is the Nestle-Aland 28th edition.\n\n\n=== Notable translatory changes ===\nIn the book of Job, Job's reaction towards God (Job 42:5–6) was drastically changed on the basis of evolved insights in Old Testament studies. In this version, Job does not acknowledge guilt, but instead stops his charge against God as he finds comfort despite his suffering. According to Old Testament scholar Hans Debel, this is \"a significant improvement over both the original NBV and most other translations in the Dutch language\".\nCertain sections of the Pauline Epistles pertain to the contrast between flesh (Koinē Greek: σάρξ, romanized: sarx) and spirit (πνεῦμα, pneuma), particularly in Romans 7–8 and Galatians 5. In the NBV21, the Greek word sarx in this portion is identified in Dutch as aards, 'earthly': aardse begeerte(n), 'earthly desire(s)'; aardse maatstaven, 'earthly measures'; aardse natuur, 'earthly nature'; het aardse streven, 'the earthly pursuit'; aardse zaken, 'earthly matters'; het aardse, 'the earthly'.\nThe names of animals were translated differently, so that five new animals were present in the NBV21 compared to the NBV. The animals present in the new translation which weren't in the previous version are:\nThe great cormorant, replacing the fish owl of the NBV;\nMonk vulture, replacing the black vulture;\nBlack kite;\nEurasian bittern, replacing the porcupine;\nOne-humped camel.\nA passage in Ecclesiastes (Ecclesiastes 7:26–29), which is often interpreted misogynistically, was translated differently. According to the translators, careful attention for the Hebrew style of the book showed that the writer of Ecclesiastes does not present its own opinion, but is instead quoting a common view, which it then rejects.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOn 10 March 2022, the foundation The Best Dutch Book Designs (Dutch: De Best Verzorgde Boeken) announced the standard edition of the NBV21 as one of the 32 most well-designed books of the Netherlands in 2021. New Testament scholar Barend Drews suggested the translation could be improved both on the fields of concordance and distinction between the attributes of text and of language, but supported its use in Protestant liturgy. Even after the release of the NBV21, Catholic churches continued to use the Willibrord translation for Dutch-language liturgy. In an open letter to the NBG, the European Society of Women in Theological Reseach, Nederland and the Dutch Ecumenical Women's Synod criticized the use of reverential capitalization in the NBV21, stating that it strengthened a patriarchal image of God.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe following is a list of editions of the NBV21 which significantly vary in textual content and have been sanctioned by the Dutch-Flemish Bible Society.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBible translations into Dutch\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite of the NBV21\nOnline accountability and colophon of the NBV21\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMatthijs de Jong, 'Op weg naar de NBV21', Met Andere Woorden 39/2 (2020), 4-19 (online).\nMatthijs de Jong, 'NBV21 in context.

        "content": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau: Restless Genius is a 2005 biography by Leo Damrosch, published by Houghton Mifflin. The book depicts the life of eighteenth century philosopher, writer, composer and political theorist Jean-Jacques Rousseau, documenting his unorthodox rise from obscure beginnings in which the orphaned and unschooled Rousseau rose from meandering journeyman to become one of the foremost thinkers in the Age of Enlightenment.\nThe book was a finalist for the 2005 National Book Award for Nonfiction.\n\n\n== Narrative ==\nThe biography details Rousseau's life, explaining his tumultuous beginnings when his mother died shortly after birthing him and his father abandoned him during his adolescence. Rosseau spent the next years travelling around Europe, and developed a relationship with Madame de Warens. With no formal education and penniless, he worked various jobs such as a valet, a diplomatic secretary, a teacher, and a translator for a monk. Around the age of 35, Rousseau settled in Paris and began his writings for which he would be known. He wrote the opera Le Devin du Village (The Village Soothsayer) in 1752, which is still performed to this day. In Paris, he married Therese Levasseur. \nRosseau's ideas about the inherent goodness of people and societal institutions' inhibition of that goodness with its social stratification and regulations proved divisive in their day. This view was in contrast to the prevailing view at the time of the Enlightenment that people were inherently immoral and institutions, such as government or the church, were required to curb people's brutality and allow humanity to prosper. Rousseau explains this theory of the inherent goodness of man and society's restrictions in his 1755 treatise Discourse on Inequality. His work The Social Contract (1762) further extolled the individual rights of people and advocated for a limited government which functions in a limited capacity only to allow people to exercise their freedom.\nRousseau's novel about two lovers, Julie; or, The New Heloise, published in 1761, became the most popular novel of the 18th century. He then published Emile, or on Education in 1762, an instructional book which was highly influential and became one of the most important works on raising children. In 1782, he wrote his Confessions, which was an intimate self reflection on his life. The work included many of his regrets and perceived shortcomings, including giving up all of his children for adoption. His confessions would become the archetype for the modern day autobiography. In 1776 Rousseau wrote a collection of poetry Reveries of the Solitary Walker, which included many poems about his own life.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWriting for The New York Times, writer Stacy Schiff stated that the biography was lacking in explaining the development of some of Rousseau's philosophical ideas and theories. However, in conclusion, Schiff states: \"...Rousseau pioneered the concept that ideas fell out of experience, and the erratic, inventive urgency of the life is all here. A delight to read, Damrosch comes as close to Rousseau's authentic self as we are likely to get.\" Writing for the Washington Post, author Michael Dirda applauded Damrosch's literary style stating: \"Damrosch is an academic -- a professor of 18th-century literature at Harvard -- but he nonetheless writes for ordinary readers, with clarity, a light touch and immense zest.\" Darda concluded that the biography \"provides an ideal introduction to both this complex man and his troubling ideas. It is an important book, but also a provocative and exceptionally entertaining one.\" Writing for The Nation, historian David A. Bell criticized the book for not discussing Rosseau's works in the context of the historical period; the Enlightenment, including omitting Rousseau's interactions with other contemporary thinkers, common readers or the reactions his works provoked from the church or the state. However, Bell stated the biography succeeded marvelously by providing a \"full, vivid, dramatic and well informed portrait\" of its subject.\nThe book was a finalist for the 2005 National Book Award for Nonfiction, with the judges stated the work was: \"Witty, pungent, and erudite, Leo Damrosch’s Rousseau renders one of the most canonical figures in Western literary and political thought into a full-bodied human, flawed, glorious, searching, and bold.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

After representing Conquense's reserve team, he retired and became a manager of Athletic Bilbao's youth sides, after being invited by Joaquín Caparrós.\nAfter working in the youth sides of Periso CF, Ayllón was also a manager of a Real Madrid foundation team and later became a youth coordinator at CD Guadalajara. In 2012, he became Miguel López's assistant at CD Azuqueca, and was named manager of the club ahead of the 2014–15 season.\nIn May 2015, despite achieving promotion to Tercera División, Ayllón left Azuqueca. On 5 July 2016, after one year as manager of the Castilla–La Mancha Football Federation's youth sides, he was named at the helm of CD Toledo's B-team in the fourth division.\nOn 19 June 2017, after avoiding relegation, Ayllón took over UB Conquense also in division four. He led Conquense to promotion in his first year, but was sacked on 14 January 2019, after a nine-match winless streak which saw the club enter the relegation zone. \nOn 4 June 2019, Ayllón took over CDA Navalcarnero also in the fourth level, and renewed his contract in May 2020 after reaching the promotion play-offs. After achieving promotion to Segunda División B, he led the side of the round of 16 of the 2020–21 Copa del Rey, but opted to leave on 12 May 2021, after retaining Naval's place in the newly-formed Segunda División RFEF.\nOn 14 March 2022, after nearly a year of inactivity, Ayllón was appointed manager of Primera División RFEF side Unionistas de Salamanca CF for the rest of the campaign, replacing sacked Dani Mori. He left the club by mutual agreement on 1 June, after narrowly missing out a play-off spot.\nOn 6 June 2022, Ayllón took over UD San Sebastián de los Reyes also in the third division, but was dismissed on 16 January of the following year. On 9 April 2024, after more than a year without a club, he was appointed manager of Segunda Federación side CF Talavera de la Reina, on a contract until the end of the season; he replaced sacked Pedro Díaz.\n\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\nAs of match played 28 April 2024\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLuis Ayllón manager profile at BDFutbol",

        "content": "Almut Burchard is a mathematician whose research interests include functional analysis, probability theory, and their application in network calculus for the stochastic analysis of communication networks. Educated in Germany and the US, she has worked in the US and Canada, where she is a professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nBurchard earned a diploma in mathematics (the German equivalent of a master's degree) in 1989 from Heidelberg University, with research supervised by Willi Jäger on mathematical modeling of chemical reactions. She shifted to pure mathematics for her doctoral work on the Riesz rearrangement inequality at Georgia Tech, supervised by Michael Loss, completing her Ph.D. in 1994.\nShe was a faculty member in the Princeton University department of mathematics from 1994 to 1998, and at the University of Virginia from 1998 to 2005. She has held her present position at the University of Toronto since 2005.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 2021, the Fields Institute listed Burchard as a Fellow, recognizing her \"energetic support\" of the Fields Institute's, in helping develop an online program on fluid dynamics, and in mentorship of undergraduates.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page\nAlmut Burchard publications indexed by Google Scholar",

        "content": "Jacob Monk (born June 4, 2001) is an American football center for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nThe son of Stanley and Chareen Monk, Jacob Monk grew up in Clayton, North Carolina, a suburb of Raleigh.\nMonk has been involved in working with individuals with special needs in North Carolina, particularly because his older brother, Miles, has Down syndrome, which Monk cites as formative in developing compassion for others in himself.\nMonk was a four-star prospect coming out of Corinth Holders High School.\n\n\n== College career ==\nHe played five years of college football for the Duke Blue Devils. Monk's father, Stanley, played running back for Duke from 1984-87. Uncle Quincy Monk played linebacker in the NFL for the New York Giants and Houston Texans from 2002-2004.\nAt Duke, Monk primarily played right guard, but also took snaps as a right tackle, center and left guard in more than 50 games for the Blue Devils. Monk was named All-ACC thrice. As a senior, he was team captain.\nIt was during college that Monk learned he had an incredibly rare albeit mild allergy: cold urticaria, which is an allergy to cold water. For Monk, this manifests as breaking out out in hives after being submerged in an ice bath.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nMonk was selected in the fifth round (163rd overall) of the 2024 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers. In so doing, Monk became the first student-athlete from Corinth Holders High School to be selected in the NFL Draft.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGreen Bay Packers bio\nDuke Blue Devils bio",

A number of other countries also have similar councils, many of these serving as inspiration for the decision to establish the Swedish National Security Council.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe National Security Council is chaired by the Prime Minister and consists of cabinet ministers. These are: The Minister of Justice, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Defence, the Minister of Civil Defence and the Minister of Finance. Other leaders of political parties that are members of the government also become members of the council.\n\n\n== History and function ==\nThe National Security Councils creation was first announced by Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson in his Declaration of Government held on 18 October 2022. The proposal to create one had however existed for many years and a Political Security Council had existed since the premiership of Stefan Löfven. On 10 November 2022 Henrik Landerholm was appointed as the first National Security Advisor to the Government and tasked with advicing the prime minister on how the council could be structured and operate.\nThe National Security Council ordinarily convenes every other week under the Prime Minister's chairmanship. It may however meet more often if required, such as in a state of emergency. The role of the council is to make it easier for cabinet ministers to inform each other and the prime minister on matters of national security and cooperate operations between their departments regarding national security.\n\n\n== National Security Advisor ==\nThe National Security Advisor to the Government of Sweden (Swedish: Regeringens Nationella Säkerhetsrådgivare) is the official responsible for assisting and advicing the National Security Council and the Prime Minister, as well as managing the Councils affairs. They shall also provide analysis and information to the council.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Flora Juliette Cooke (December 25, 1864 – February 21, 1953) was an American educator who played a prominent role in the progressive education movement of the early 20th century. As the long-serving principal of the Francis W. Parker School in Chicago, Cooke was instrumental in developing and disseminating the principles of progressive education, which emphasized child-centered learning, hands-on activities, and the integration of the curriculum. She's considered a significant figure in the field of educational reform during this period, due her innovative approaches to teaching and her commitment to inclusive, democratic education.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nFlora Juliette Cooke was born on December 25, 1864, in Bainbridge, Ohio. When she was five years old, her mother passed away and she was sent to live with her mother's close friends, Charles and Luella (Miller) Cooke, who legally adopted her in 1881. Cooke attended public schools in Youngstown, Ohio, and after graduating from high school in 1884, she taught school in Ohio for five years.\n\n\n=== Career ===\n\n\n==== Innovative teaching practices ====\nIn 1885, Cooke was assigned to teach 125 first-grade students at the Hellman Street School in Youngstown. To keep some children occupied while directly instructing others, she created various activities and games. The school's principal, Zonia Baber, a recent graduate of the Cook County Normal School in Chicago, not only approved of Cooke's approach but also provided helpful suggestions. Baber later persuaded Colonel Francis Parker, a prominent figure in the progressive education movement, to invite Cooke to study at the Normal School, where she found herself aligned with Parker's educational philosophies.\n\n\n==== The Francis W. Parker School ====\nIn 1899, Cooke moved with Parker to the Chicago Institute, and in 1901, she became the principal of the newly established Francis W. Parker School, a position she held for the next thirty-three years. Under her leadership, the school became known for its implementation of progressive education principles. Cooke believed that teachers should have the freedom to collaborate and take responsibility for the direction of their teaching, and the teachers at the Parker School produced curriculum materials and guides for practice, many of which Cooke edited and published.\nCooke's approach to the Parker School emphasized serving students from diverse economic backgrounds. With the support of philanthropist Anita McCormick Blaine, the school provided scholarships for children whose parents could not afford the tuition. Cooke also focused on reading instruction, encouraging children to talk and write about their experiences and producing illustrated leaflets to be used in place of standard readers.\n\n\n==== Extending Principles to high school ====\nCooke was committed to extending progressive education principles to the development of adolescent students. She was concerned that the rigid entrance requirements of most colleges controlled high school curricula and failed to account for the artistic, social, and moral qualities promoted by the Parker School and similar institutions. In 1932, the school participated in the Eight Year Study of High Schools sponsored by the Commission on the Relation of School and College of the Progressive Education Association.\n\n\n=== Later life and legacy ===\nAfter her retirement in 1934, Cooke continued to serve on the board of trustees of the Parker School and remained involved in various organizations. She was instrumental in the founding of the North Shore Country Day School, which was modeled on the Parker School, and Roosevelt University, which was dedicated to providing university education for Chicago students who could not afford to attend more expensive institutions. Toward the end of her career, the 80-year-old Flora Juliette Cooke remained an active advocate for progressive ideals.\nCooke died in 1953 at her home in Chicago, having never married.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGreen, Nancy S. \"Cooke, Flora Juliette (1864-1953), progressive educator.\" American National Biography. 1 Feb. 2000; Accessed 27 Apr. 2024. https://www-anb-org.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-0900195.\n\n\n== References ==",

His father, Juan de Freitas, was from the Canary Islands; his mother, Gerónima de Rueda, was native to the area. He entered the Franciscan order on June 4, 1650, and accompanied Governor Bernardo López de Mendizábal to New Mexico in December 1658. From 1659 to 1660, he served at Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purisima Concepción de Quarai.\nIn 1661, Freitas testified to the Holy Office in the Inquisition trial of López de Mendizábal. He recounted a conversation in which López had claimed that the bull Omnimoda had been revoked, limiting the powers of mendicant orders in the New World. He also accused López of allowing the local Hopi to perform their traditional Kachina dances.\nFreitas subsequently accompanied López's replacement, Diego de Peñalosa, to Santa Fe, and became custos there. In 1706, Freitas testified to Governor Francisco Antonio Marín del Valle about the likely location of the body of another Franciscan, Geronimo de la Llana.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Charles Cazalet (June 22, 1858 – January 18, 1933) was president of the Union of Gymnastics Societies of France from 1896 to 1931 and of the International Gymnastics Federation from 1924 to 1933.\nSon of a Protestant family of Bordeaux wine merchants, Cazalet worked in the family business after completing his studies at the Lycée de Bordeaux. A philanthropic businessman, he initiated several social measures and created the first neighborhood gymnastics association. Elected to the Bordeaux city council, he took advantage of this mandate to innovate by creating popular shower baths, low-cost housing, and allotments. Then, without neglecting his professional commitments, he devoted himself more specifically to the development of gymnastics. President of the Union des sociétés de gymnastique de France in 1897, he held this position for 34 years, adding in 1924 the presidency of the new International Gymnastics Federation, which he held until he died in 1933.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCharles Cazalet, a major figure in Bordeaux, is intimately linked to the city's life at the beginning of the 20th century. He was born in Cenon on June 22, 1858, into a Protestant family of wine merchants. Married in 1885 to Alice Hauchecorne, he had three children, including a son killed in the First World War on September 3, 1916.\n\n\n=== Professional and civic commitments ===\n\nAfter studying at the Lycée de Bordeaux, he began assisting his father in 1878, introducing a profit-sharing scheme for employees. In 1881, he became secretary of the Chambre syndicale du commerce en gros des vins et spiritueux de la Gironde. A true social patron, his convictions led him to found and preside over the La Bastidienne gymnastics society in 1884, to invigorate the neighborhood of his neighbors and employees. In 1887, he took over the management of the family businessC 2. In 1893, he founded and chaired the Société anonyme du pont à transbordeur de Bordeaux. In 1908, he chaired the Syndicat général du commerce d'importation et d'exportation de Bordeaux, the Comité régional des conseillers du commerce extérieur and was vice-president of the Comité national.\nMarried in 1889, he also became involved in social issues, helping his young wife to found the La Bastide crèche in 1891, the same year he organized a public heating system for the underprivileged during a particularly harsh winter. Elected to the Bordeaux city council and deputy mayor from 1892 to 1896, he made a considerable contribution to improving the situation of his fellow citizens. On April 13, 1892, he was responsible for setting up the Œuvre bordelaise des bains-douches à bon marché (Bordeaux low-cost shower-baths charity), chaired by the mayor of Bordeaux and of which he was general secretary. This was the starting point for the public shower-bath establishments invented sometime earlier for prisons. From 1899 onwards, he imported them to the capital, from where they spread to other cities.\n\nOn the following December 28, he founded the Société bordelaise des habitations à bon marché, which expanded rapidly from 1902 onwards. Although he gave up his municipal duties in 1896, perhaps disillusioned with political life, he remained faithful to his social and civic commitments right to the end. In 1905 he founded the Œuvre bordelaise des jardins ouvriers and in 1911 the Société de crédit immobilier de Gironde. The same year, he joined the Board of Governors of the Ligue de l'enseignement. In 1918, he created the Banque Populaire de la Gironde, and in 1927 opened the Clinique de La Bastide. According to Jean-Paul Callède, “Cazalet is unquestionably one of the Bordeaux personalities who contributed most to the evolution of local society under the Third Republic”. However, Cazalet's fame extended beyond the city and its major achievements, for from 1896 to 1931, he acquired a national dimension by becoming president of the Union des sociétés de gymnastique de France (USGF), which he transformed from a patriotic educational organization into a sports organization.\nIn 1929, Maison Cazalet et fils was hit hard by the economic crisis, and Charles Cazalet, affected by the death of his wife, relinquished the main responsibilities he had held until then.\n\n\n=== Republic gymnastics ===\nIndeed, gymnastics was to be the best means of expressing his commitment. In 1873, his parents enrolled him in the Bordeaux Gymnastics Society, where he was a student instructor in 1878 and a member of the board of directors in 1881. In 1884, he founded and chaired La Bastidienne, Bordeaux's first popular gymnastics society. The following year, he helped organize the XIth Fête Fédérale in Bordeaux: to this end, his Bordeaux friend Daniel Merillon had been elected President of the USGF at the Fête Fédérale in Amiens the previous year. Cazalet also set up the first instructors' course in Bordeaux. In 1890, he was rapporteur for the finance committee of the USGF, whose presidency and board changed with each federal festival. At the 1893 Congrès de l'éducation physique, he spoke in defense of gymnastics and the games.\nIn 1894, La Bastidienne inaugurated its new gymnasium in the presence of Joseph Sansboeuf, and the following year, Cazalet again became rapporteur for the USGF finance committee. He was elected president in 1897, after helping to revise the statutes. Up until the dawn of the 20th century, the USGF was primarily a think-tank whose steering committee boasted the scientific, political, literary, and media luminaries of the day. Proud of the organization of its major federal festivities since 1875, it nevertheless remained reserved, to say the least, about sporting competition per se, in line with the positions of the European board chaired by the Belgian Cupérus. As a result, only one French gymnast took part in the gymnastics tournament at the Athens Olympic Games in 1896. Charles Cazalet took over the presidency a year later, a position he held until 1931.\n\nIn 1900, at the Paris Olympics, gymnastics, along with cycling, was the most popular sport in France. It was also at the heart of the Third Republic's physical and moral education and, according to Jules Ferry, the true “peaceful avant-garde of the fatherland in arms”. On June 3 and 4, the USGF inaugurated the brand-new Vincennes velodrome with its federal festival, attended by 8,050 gymnasts from all over France. The ensuing international competition, held on July 29 and 30 as part of the Universal Exhibition, was won by Gustave Sandras and was a great success for the French gymnasts, who relegated the first foreigner, a Swiss, to 18th place. On September 2, the competition organized by the Association des Sociétés de Gymnastique de la Seine brought the gymnastics festivities to a close. Cazalet, already convinced of the value of competition, capitalized on the craze and lobbied the European office for the regular organization of gymnastics competitions.\nAt the same time, he was determined to make the opportunity a permanent one in France, and invited the painter Octave Denis Victor Guillonnet to the next federal festival in Nice on April 7 and 8, 1901. 3,000 French gymnasts marched past Gambetta's tomb in a solemn national tribute. He arranged for the work immortalizing the moment to be etched and reproduced on a large scale. In a letter to Étienne Dujardin-Beaumetz, Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Fine Arts, dated October 2, 1909, he stated his objective: “propaganda engravings which, I believe, would serve admirably the patriotic cause to which we are attached; the memory of this great event, the ideas it evokes, the memory of Gambetta and the defense of the nation are all radiating forces to further increase the patriotic and republican feelings of all our youth”. In 1905, he organized the Fête Fédérale in Bordeaux, in the presence of Émile Loubet, President of the Republic, and again to mark the inauguration of a monument to Gambetta.\n\n\n=== Sports development at USGF ===\nOn April 12, 1903, the USGF was recognized as a public utility and the first international tournament was held in Antwerp under the aegis of the European office. France took first place in the team event. The USGF had entered the sporting era, and President Charles Cazalet took charge of the next tournament, held in Bordeaux in 1905 on the occasion of the Fête Fédérale: France did it again and Marcel Lalue, from Limoges, won the individual ranking. In 1908, Charles Cazalet headed 100 French gymnasts to the London Games. Until the Great War, France disputed first place with Bohemia, never finishing higher than second. Individually, in addition to Lalue, Josef Martinez and Marco Torres reached the top of the podium, the latter twice. Like Martinez, Torres hails from Algeria, which quickly proved to be a region of gymnastic excellence. The USGF organized its French championship there in 1930 to celebrate the centenary of the Sidi-Ferruch landing.\n\nCazalet attached great importance to the training of managers, most of whom were military personnel or former military personnel from the École de Joinville. To provide them with a higher level of training, in 1903 he financed the Cours Supérieur d'Education Physique created at the Sorbonne by Georges Demenÿ, Étienne-Jules Marey's assistant at the Parc des Princes physiological station. This course foreshadowed the university integration of teacher training. Attacked by his compatriot Philippe Tissié, Demenÿ saw the dispute temporarily turn to his advantage. The USGF's main objective remained patriotic, and it played a major role in providing the nation with the soldiers it was hoping for to ensure its revenge, thus securing all the ministerial support it needed. To this end, its competition program remains above all collective and highly eclectic. Champion titles are decided just as much in the pole vault or the sledgehammer as in the high bar; even at the world championships, this continued to be the case until 1954. Only the Olympic Games tournaments were limited to gymnastic apparatus.\nThe USGF, which comprised 1,100 associations in 1914, was exclusively male. In 1912, the Union française des sociétés de gymnastique féminine was created, followed in 1916 by the Fédération de sociétés féminines françaises de gymnastique et des sports (FSFFGS) and then, on October 12 of the same year, the Fédération féminine française de gymnastique et d'éducation physique (FFFGEP). One hundred thousand gymnasts were killed in the First World War, during which Cazalet distinguished himself as a senior officer and lost his only son. Nevertheless, in June 1919, the USGF was able to organize the first post-war federal festival in Nancy, which had returned to the bosom of France.\nUnder his presidency, the USGF also invested in the colonial Empire: in his book, Jean Latte cites Algéria-Sports and the Tricolore de Dakar among the USGF's major associations. Although the USGF had already organized its federal festival in Algiers in 1896, it returned there in 1930 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the conquest of Algeria. However, international results declined: France fell back to third place at the international tournaments in Ljubljana in 1922 and Lyon in 1926, before moving up to second place in 1930 in Luxembourg. From the following year onwards, international tournaments gave way to world championships, and France fell back again in the overall rankings.\nDuring this period, the USGF remained a strong showcase for the defense of the republican ideal, and Cazalet mobilized his federal party whenever necessary: in 1929 in Orleans to mark the secular state's claim to Joan of Arc as a national heroine, and in 1931 in Paris for the Paris International Colonial Exhibition.\nDespite his services, his never-ending duel with Tissié and his medical colleagues finally turned to his disadvantage in 1923: the higher education course fell out of the hands of the USGF, which had to give up the right to govern the training of physical education teachers. Cazalet refocused on training the gymnastics managers of his associations, and from 1927 onwards the USGF organized an annual course for civilian instructors in Dinard. The course was moved to Saint-Maur during the Occupation. In 1931, Cazalet, suffering from his professional setbacks, stepped down as president and died two years later.\n\n\n== Notoriety ==\n\n\n=== International dimensions ===\nHis relations with the Czech sokols led to his appointment as Czechoslovak consul in Bordeaux, and his professional connections enabled him to expatriate the federal festival to North Africa on three occasions (Algiers in 1896 and 1930, Tunis in 1912). In 1924, at the Paris Congress, Charles Cazalet, vice-president of the Bureau des fédérations européennes de gymnastique (BFEG) since 1910 succeeded the Belgian Cupérus at the head of the Fédération internationale de gymnastique (FIG), which had replaced the BFEG founded in 1881 two years earlier. He became its second president and remained in office until he died in 1933. It was during his term of office that the biennial international tournament was transformed into the Gymnastics World Championships in 1931. These were then organized in Paris by the international federation itself.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nHe was promoted to the rank of officier d'académie in 1886, and officier de l'Instruction publique in 1895. He received the medal of honor from the Société nationale d'encouragement au bien in 1895 and the gold medal from Assistance publique in 1908.\nThe recipient of numerous foreign awards, his promotion to the Legion of Honor was meteoric: knight in 1896, officer in 1900, and commander in 1912. This last promotion was confirmed in 1919 to Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Cazalet for his exemplary behavior at Verdun and on the Somme. In 1923, he was awarded the plaque of Grand Officer.\n\nIn 1931, he was awarded a Grand Prix at the Paris International Colonial Exhibition.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nLegion of Honor\nFrench Gymnastics Federation\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarrull, Raymond (1984).

        "content": "Somai Kisku (born 1959) is a Santali writer and Sari Dharam Guru Baba (Santal's Religion).\nSomai Kisku was born on 25th February 1959 at Basantapur, a small village, under the Purba Bardhaman district of West Bengal in the peasant family of Rasiklal Kisku and Fulmani Kisku. He is the third son of his parents among their ten children. He received his early education from Basantapur Gourmohan Primary School and then studied at Jamalpur Higher Secondary School. Later he was admitted to Boinchigram Bihari Lal High School in the ninth class and passed Higher Secondary in 1976. He obtained a bachelor degree from Haripal Vivekannda College, under the University of Burdwan in 1981. Thereafter he joined as an Inspector in the Department of West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation. He retired after completing his long service career in 2019.\nIn the late eighties, extreme poverty, illiteracy, daily life struggles and the experience of the real situation at that time led him to begin to write. He formed Hooghly Zila Santali Sahitya Parisad in 1988, which is now known as Santali Sahitya Baisi. He has been conducting Santali Sahitya Baisi with honesty, devotion and competence from the beginning until now.\nTapal, a quarterly Santali literary magazine, started publication under his supervision. This magazine carried the excellence of Santali literature. But it was only in 2002 he published his first book RATAN, a novel which reflects the life struggle of a poor Santal farmer. He went on to publish Kherwal Saota Re Ratan in 2005.\nGuru Somai Kisku was recently honoured with the prestigious Tagore Literature Awards 2010, instituted by Samsung in collaboration with Sahitya Akademi. He received this award for his work Namalia, first published in 2008. Namalia describes and depicts the lifestyle of the Santal people of 'Namal'. Based on facts, it tells the story of the migration of these people to the rich paddy-growing region of 'Namal' due to the construction of a dam on the Kansavati river.\nHe has also received Sharada Prasad Smriti Puraskar from Paschimbanga Santali Academy, Govt. Of West Bengal, India.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Karol Marcinkowski High School, along with the Karol Marcinkowski Adult High School, and from 2001 to 2019 also the Karol Marcinkowski Bilingual Gymnasium, forming part of the No. 1 General Education School Complex, is the oldest public high school in Poznań, also known as Marcinek.\nIt occupies a neo-Gothic building at 16 Bukowska Street, erected between 1901 and 1903 for the German Royal Gymnasium named after Augusta Victoria, whose establishment was aimed at the Germanization of Greater Poland. After Poland regained independence, on 1 May 1919, it was renamed the Polish State Gymnasium named after Karol Marcinkowski. During World War II, the building housed military hospitals, successively: German and Soviet. For this reason, the school regained its building only at the end of 1945, although classes resumed in other buildings before the city was liberated. In the 1960s, the school was associated with UNESCO, and expanded French language teaching began, since 1991 conducted by the bilingual section.\nSince the beginning of the Polish institution's existence, the scout troop Błękitna Czternastka has been operating alongside it, and since 1989, the Alumni Association of the Karol Marcinkowski Gymnasium and High School has also been functioning as an auxiliary organization. Over the years, the school has published numerous magazines and is also the organizer of a nationwide theater festival and local TED conferences.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From 1919 ===\n\nIn 1899, Johann Frydrychowicz, the last chairman of the Jeżyce council, who lacked the support of his colleagues, leased a plot of land located at the intersection of Bukerstrasse (now Bukowska) and Cesarzowa Wiktoria (now Grunwaldzka) streets. This plot was part of an inn of the nearby Villa Flora. He did so without the consent of the previous owner, Bolesław Szermer, who thereby lost an estate worth about 5,000 marks. The new owner, the penny-farthing merchant Max Lohmeyer, developed the area into a training ground for riding the vehicles. In winter, it was converted into an ice rink. After the annexation of Jeżyce to Poznań in 1900, the Prussian authorities decided to build a German state gymnasium at this location, intending to increase the number of secondary schools in the city (at the end of the 19th century, there were eight, including three boys' gymnasiums: the Catholic St. Mary Magdalene, the Evangelical Friedrich Wilhelm, and the Real Gotthilf Berger). It became a significant center for the Germanization of Greater Poland.\nConstruction of the building began in August 1901 according to the design by the German architect Fuchs from the Ministry of Public Works, who also supervised the construction work. The construction was completed in April 1903, and the ceremonial consecration of the building took place on 16 April 1903. Until Poland regained independence, it housed the eight-year gymnasium Königliches Auguste-Victoria Gymnasium (Augusta Victoria Royal Gymnasium). The first students were boys transferred from the Gotthilf Berger Gymnasium on Strzelecka Street. From there, part of the teaching staff and the first director Moritz Friebe, who served from 1903 to 1911, came to Marcinek. He was succeeded by Paul Schultze, who served in his position until 30 March 1919. The language of instruction was German, and most of the students were of German nationality. Polish and Jewish students formed a minority in the school. Forty-nine Polish high school students, initiated by those transferred from Berger Gymnasium, operated in the underground Tomasz Zan Society during the partitions, where they learned Polish history, the Polish language, drill, and weapon handling. The number of students in the first year of the German institution's operation (1903/1904) was 489 (including 237 transferred from Berger Gymnasium), while in the last year (1918/1919) it was 569.\n\n\n=== 1919–1945 ===\nOn 1 April 1919, the Commissariat of the Supreme People's Council appointed Antoni Borzucki as the first director of the State Gymnasium named after Karol Marcinkowski. A month later, on 1 May, the first school year was inaugurated. This date, along with the symbolic act of Polish students breaking the black Prussian eagle located above the side entrance to the building facing the playground, is considered the official start of the Polish institution's operations. Similar to its predecessor, it remained an eight-year boys' school. At that time, 358 Polish and 299 German students began their education. The German minority was divided into eight homogeneous and three mixed classes. Out of the 31 German teachers from the partition period, only seven remained, so initially, some classes were still taught in German. Some of the first Polish professors were brought by Polish educational authorities from the Galicia region. The solemn inauguration of the 1919/1920 school year took place on 1 September 1919 in the school auditorium. At that time, 677 people resumed their education (thus ranking second after the Maria Magdalena Gymnasium, which became the leading position from 1928). The first graduated ins took place in December 1919. Only three students took the Polish exam at that time, and in the following year, four. German students and teachers finally left the school at the beginning of the 1920/1921 school year. It was also then that the number of candidates taking the Polish-language exam increased sharply.\nDue to the large number of students, in October 1920, it became necessary to relocate 6 classes to a separate building on Matejki Street. After their subsequent moves to a tenement house on Wyspiańskiego Street in September 1921, the Ignacy Paderewski Gymnasium was established there as an independent institution. For those who participated in the Polish–Soviet War in 1920, the school organized a separate course of study from 1920 to 1923. For this reason (despite the separation of 6 classes), in the 1921/1922 school year, Marcinek had 706 students.\nDuring the interwar period, Marcinek, alongside the Saint Mary Magdalene High School, was one of the best high schools in Poznań. Admission to the school for graduates of four-year primary schools was based on an entrance exam. The number of candidates at that time ranged from 3 to 5 per place. Each year, about 450 students attended the school, taught by an average of 30–40 teachers. Most of the teachers were men (the school employed only two female teachers throughout the interwar period), often working simultaneously at the University of Poznań. At that time, there were two class profiles: classical and humanistic. Emphasis was placed on the study of the Polish language and other foreign languages ​​(including Greek and Latin). The weekly workload, with six days of schooling, did not exceed thirty hours. Most of the student community at that time came from the working intelligentsia. In 1928, the tuition fee was 110 złoty per semester, and three years later, it increased by 40 złoty. In case of financial difficulties or good academic performance, some students were exempted from paying fees.\nSince 1919, the school has had a scout troop called Błękitna Czternastka. On 7 December 1923, the Association of Friends of the Gymnasium named after Karol Marcinkowski was founded, bringing together alumni and their families to provide financial support to students and equip classrooms. In 1921, a medical office (run by Jan Adamski for a long time) was established, and eight years later, a dental clinic. In the early years of the Polish school's operation, optional school uniforms were introduced in the form of a brown rogatywka with a purple trim and a silver (for the gymnasium) or gold (for the high school) cord. In the mid-1930s, mandatory, standardized uniforms were introduced. For the four-year gymnasium, it was a navy blue outfit with blue trim and a shield with the number 780 on a blue background, along with a navy blue cap with a blue trim. In the case of high school students, the blue color was replaced with burgundy.\nIn 1938, the last eight-year cycle high school graduated in took place. In the following year, the final exams were already held in a six-year cycle (four-year gymnasium and two-year high school, culminating in small and large exams, respectively). In the 1937/1938 school year, there were 480 students attending the school. The outbreak of World War II caused a break in its operations. As a result of wartime activities and repression by the occupiers, 14 pre-war teachers and 119 students (including 10 graduates of the German gymnasium) perished. During the war, the building premises initially served as German military barracks, then as a military hospital, and from February 1945 as a Red Army hospital.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\nThe functioning of the institution under the pre-war organizational system as the Gymnasium and High School named after Karol Marcinkowski was resumed on 15 February 1945, still during the battle for the city. It was the first school in Poznań to resume its activities after World War II. At that time, the pre-war Polish language teacher (working at Marcinek and the Gymnasium of St. Mary Magdalene) Czesław Latawiec was appointed as the first principal. He held this position until his transfer as the superintendent on 30 April 1945. Information about the resumption of classes was posted on handwritten cards distributed in the city by participants of secret gatherings during the war. Within the first few days, about 700 candidates applied, of which 509 were ultimately admitted. Initially, due to the operation of a Soviet hospital in the building on Bukowska Street, classes were held in buildings successively located on Jarochowskiego, Matejki, Mylna, and Różana streets.\nThe ceremonial opening of the school year, inaugurated with a mass at the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows on Głogowska Street, took place on Thursday, 1 March 1945. Due to the lack of an assembly hall in the building on Jarochowskiego Street, it was held in the gymnasium near Wilson Park. Each relocation involved students moving school equipment, which had been stored by two caretakers in wooden sheds on the school premises during the war. Lessons on Matejki Street took place from 6:30 AM to 11:00 AM, so that afterwards, the second-grade girls of the II High School could enter. Even before moving to Różana Street, students organized a march under the windows of the then seat of the Curatorium with a banner reading Wandering Gymnasium and High School No. 1 in Poznań. The school regained its own building only in December 1945. However, it required cleaning and replacing windows broken during the war. Classes were finally resumed after the winter break. The final relocation was led by Feliks Załachowski, the pre-war principal of the institution, who spent the last years of the war in a concentration camp, returning to his position in September 1945.\nInitially, to make up for the lost time during the war, education for \"delayed\" years was conducted in an accelerated mode: the material of a two-year high school was covered in one year. At that time, even 25-year-olds attended school. The first post-war graduated in exams took place from 4 to 9 April 1945, followed by subsequent exams in July 1945 and January and June 1946. In the post-war Marcinek, there were three class profiles: humanistic, mathematical-physical, and mathematical-biological. In the 1945/1946 school year, 610 people attended the school. Since then, the majority of the student community consisted of youth from intelligentsia families. In the post-war years, little emphasis was placed on students' attire. The mandatory uniform was unsuccessfully attempted to be reintroduced at the end of the 1950s. On 30 October 1945, the Błękitna Czternastka Scout Troop was reactivated, and on 7 November 1946, on the hundredth anniversary of Karol Marcinkowski's death, a new school banner was funded. After the dissolution of the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association in 1949, the troop was reactivated only in January 1957. In 1967, the tradition of annual hikes to Dąbrówka Ludomska, the place of the patron's death, began, taking place on the last Saturday of September. Since 1969, their organization has been managed by the Błękitna Czternastka.\nIn 1948, teaching began in the four-year comprehensive high school system (following a seven-year primary school). It was also then that it adopted the name it bears to this day, the Karol Marcinkowski High School. Since 1956, it has had the status of a training school of the Adam Mickiewicz University, and since 1964, it has been part of the UNESCO Schools Association. In the 1962/1963 school year, at the initiative of the director Ludwik Graja, extended French language teaching was introduced in some classes. In the 1967/1968 school year, along with the first students after eight years of primary school, Marcinek also admitted girls for the first time, who have since constituted the majority of the student community. It was also then that the new numbering of classes I–IV (replacing the old VIII–XI) began. Due to the demographic boom of the 1960s and 1970s, the 1973/1974 school year saw a record number of students: 1,055 individuals in 28 classes.\nThe Student Government, active since the school's inception, initiated the hanging of crosses in classrooms in 1981. In 1991, at the initiative of the principal Marek Rybarczyk, the Polish-French bilingual section, which still exists today, was established. Education was conducted in a four-year cycle, preceded by a preparatory class with 20 French lessons per week. In 2001, the Karol Marcinkowski Bilingual Gymnasium with French language began its activity, taking over the function of the \"0\" class. It was also then that the General High School Complex No. 1 was established, consisting of the newly created bilingual gymnasium, comprehensive high school, and the adult high school existing since the 1940s. A year later, teaching began in a three-year high school cycle. In connection with the education reform of 2017, it was decided to return to the system from before 2001, i.e., a four-year high school preceded by a French-language introductory class. From 1919 to 2014, the school saw 12,706 graduates, including 1,266 individuals during the interwar period.\n\n\n=== Jubilees ===\nIn 1959, celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the school were held, combined with the 1st Alumni Reunion. These were among the first such events in Poland after World War II. Ten years later, from 19 to 20 April 1969, the 2nd Reunion was again combined with the 50th anniversary of the school and the 25th anniversary of the Polish People's Republic. Over 1,000 people participated in these events. Due to the school's association with UNESCO, a solemn ceremony took place in the auditorium on 28 October 1970 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the United Nations. In 1979, a new banner was donated to the school to celebrate its 60th anniversary. The celebrations of the 70th anniversary were combined with the 3rd Alumni Reunion, which was the largest so far with over 3,000 participants. These were the first celebrations organized by the Alumni Association. Since then, they have been held regularly every five years at the initiative of the association. Since 1995, the association has also been organizing annual meetings on the second Saturday of May to commemorate the full five-year anniversaries of graduated in exams. The 80th anniversary celebrations from 15 to 16 May 1999 were honored with a concert by the band Elektryczne Gitary on the school field. On the other hand, the celebrations of the 90th anniversary from 15 to 16 May 2009 were concluded with a four-hour concert by the band Dżem. The 85th anniversary celebrations took place from 14 to 15 May 2004, and the 95th anniversary on 10 May 2014. The centenary celebrations were planned for 17 and 18 May 2019.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe school complex occupies a plot of land measuring 1,200 m2 in the triangle formed by Bukowska, Grunwaldzka, and Szylinga streets, adjacent to the Poznań Old Zoo. The main two-story neo-Gothic building, made of red brick, has two lower annexes at the side elevations. Initially, one of these annexes (southern) served as the principal's residence, while the other (northern) was designated for the caretaker's house. The interior layout is semi-bay, with classrooms located on the side facing the soccer field. The hall on the ground floor, covered with neo-Gothic lierne vault, is flanked by two spacious staircases leading to the auditorium. The original restrooms were located in a separate, longitudinal building on the west side of the main building, connected to it by two arcaded skyways. In later years, a sewage pipe was added to the main building. In the northeast corner of the plot, a separate building housing the gymnasium was located, with a botanical garden attached to it from the south. The central part of the plot was occupied by a gravel soccer field. The area south of the school building and the one adjacent to the main entrance were landscaped into small green spaces.\nThe central, elevated part of the second floor, crowned with a tower with a clock and a platform for astronomical observations, houses the auditorium with an area of 326 m2, covered by an ornate wooden hanging ceiling. Originally equipped with a small altar and an organ loft, which were used for religious services before school ceremonies. In 1929, a stage was added to the auditorium, where performances were presented as part of the Universal National Exhibition in the same year. After 1945, it was relocated under the southern wall of the room, thus obstructing one of the entrances.\nIn the 1960s, new classroom pavilions were erected on the small soccer field. Due to the increase in the number of students, a major renovation of the building was carried out between 1974 and 1978. The number of subject classrooms was increased, a central locker room and library were organized, and the installations of central heating, water, sewage, and electricity were replaced. Additionally, the teachers' room, secretariat, and management offices were relocated to the southern annex of the main building. In 1988, the first computer lab was established at the school, followed by another one in 2003.\nIn 2002, the main entrance doors to the building were reconstructed, faithfully copying the original doors. In 2004, the roof of the main building was renovated, and the clock on the tower began operating again. In 2007, an illuminated aluminum sign with the inscription Gimnazjum i Liceum im. Karola Marcinkowskiego (Karol Marcinkowski Gymnasium and High School) was placed on the north-facing main facade of the building, at a height of about 8 meters from Bukowska Street. The stained glass windows in the school auditorium were also renovated at that time. Between 2009 and 2011, a renovation of the gymnasium building was carried out, restoring its original architectural character and refurbishing the interiors. In September 2013, a thorough renovation of the auditorium was conducted, including the replacement of the parquet floor, installation of wainscoting, and repainting of the walls.\n\n\n=== Memorials ===\n\nOn 26 March 1925, a bust of the patron, created by the art teacher Aleksander Korpal, was solemnly unveiled in the building. On 18 April 1929, a commemorative plaque by the same author was unveiled, dedicated to the late first school principal, Antoni Borzucki, who passed away the previous year. It was dismantled and destroyed by the Germans during World War II. As part of the school's 50th anniversary celebrations in 1969, a plaque by Irena Rosińska was unveiled in the main hall, commemorating the teachers and students who died and were murdered between 1939 and 1945. On the occasion of the 70th anniversary, the reconstructed memorial plaque in honor of Antoni Borzucki was also unveiled there.\nOn 14 May 2005, one of the two Poznań monuments to Karol Marcinkowski, designed by Wiesław Koronowski, was unveiled in front of the main entrance. On 10 May 2008, as part of the jubilee meetings of graduating classes, a boulder with a commemorative plaque by the same author was unveiled in the garden in front of the entrance, dedicated to Stefan Borsukiewicz – an alumnus of the school and a poet who died during World War II. On 11 May 2013, another commemorative boulder by Wiesław Koronowski and Jarosław Bogucki was unveiled, dedicated to Jan and Stanisław Kasznica – Marcinek graduates and soldiers who fought in World War II. The former fell during the September Campaign, while the latter was the last Commander-in-Chief of the National Armed Forces, sentenced and executed by the communist regime in 1948.\n\n\n== People

monthly magazine Perspektywy.\n\n\n== Alumni Association ==\nIn 1989, at the initiative of the organizing committee for the 70th anniversary celebrations of the school, the Alumni Association of the Karol Marcinkowski Gymnasium and High School in Poznań was established. On 4 April of that year, it was registered under number 167 in the Register of Associations and Unions of the Social-Administrative Department of the Voivodeship Office in Poznań, and on 27 September, it was registered under number 196 in the Regional Court in Poznań. The founding meeting took place on 24 April 1989. Zbigniew Krüger was elected as the president of the association at that time. After his resignation on 18 February 1993, Gerard Sowiński, a Polish language teacher from 1964 to 1980, assumed the position. The association's authorities are elected every four years.\nThe objectives of the association include maintaining collegial ties and providing assistance to the members of the association as well as to the students and alumni of the school, preserving the bonds of the alumni with the school and the region of the Greater Poland. These objectives are pursued through the promotion of publications related to the history of the school, the achievements of the patron, and the alumni; fostering patriotic ideals of the school and its patron; providing assistance to the school in the education and upbringing of students; and organizing various meetings, events, and ceremonies. Since 1989, the association has been responsible for organizing jubilee celebrations of the school, held every five years, and since 1995, it has also organized annual meetings on the occasion of the five-year anniversaries of the matura exams. Since 1994, the association has also managed the Alumni Library, where publications by the school's alumni are collected.\n\n\n== In culture ==\nEven though the name of the high school is not mentioned in any of Małgorzata Musierowicz's books, it is recognized that almost all the youth in Jeżycjada attend Marcinek.\nTwo feature films were shot in the building: Limuzyna Daimler-Benz in 1981, directed by the school's graduate Filip Bajon, and Felix, Net i Nika oraz Teoretycznie Możliwa Katastrofa in 2012, directed by Wiktor Skrzynecki.\nFrom October 1928 until the outbreak of World War II, the school published a monthly magazine called Orlęta, which eventually gained a national character and began to be subscribed to abroad. From September 1966 for many years, the school published the Tygodnik Żakowski magazine. The rest of the numerous periodicals had a more episodic nature. From 2004 to 2015, the school published a magazine for teachers titled Pedagogia, addressing the topic of Polish education.\nSince 2001, the school has been annually organizing the Marcinek Theatre Festival in Poznań, attracting theaters from all over Poland and abroad. It has been under the media patronage of TVP3 Poznań and Gazeta Wyborcza. The jury has included figures such as Juliusz Tyszka, Paweł Szkotak, and Sergiusz Sterna-Wachowiak.\nIn 2016, the school became the first in Poznań to receive a license to organize a local TED conference under the name TEDxMarcinekSchool. Since then, five editions have been organized: in April and November 2016, January 2017, February 2018, and February 2019.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCecha, Ela (2014).

It has a €20,000 award for the author and a €5,000 award for the publisher of the work. It is the best-funded prize for a published Catalan-language novel.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe prize was created in 2017 with a €20,000 direct donation for the author and a marketing campaign valued at €5,000, with the intention of annually recognizing the best Catalan-language novel and make it known to the public. It is similar to the Prix Goncourt for French literature.\nIn the first edition, a selection committee composed of the editor of the Núvol online newspaper, Bernat Puigtobella, bookseller Olga Federico, and librarian Carme Fenoll nominated 16 novels published in 2017. Afterwards, a jury of five independent members (Harvard University professor Maria Dasca, University of Barcelona professor emeritus Rosa Cabré, University of Valencia professor Carme Gregori, University of Girona professor Xavier Pla, and cultural manager Oriol Izquierdo) selected three finalist works in the first round and selected the winner in the second round.\n\n\n== Winner and finalists ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Exponi nobis nuper fecisti, known in New Spain as Omnimoda, was a papal bull commissioned by Charles V and promulgated by Adrian VI on 10 May 1522. The bull allowed members of mendicant orders in the New World to exercise \"almost all episcopal authority\" when no diocesan bishop was within two days' travel. These powers were later confirmed at the Council of Trent.\nUnder the authority of Omnimoda, missionary priests such as Martín de Valencia and Diego de Landa acted as agents of the Inquisition in the Americas. The bull also gave missionaries the authority to dispense local Catholics from impediments to marriage.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gustav Fritz Papanek (July 12, 1926 — September 20, 2022) was an Austrian American development economist.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGustav Fritz Papanek was born July 12, 1926, to Ernst Papanek and Helene Papanek (née Goldstern). He was named for Gustav Mahler and Fritz Adler. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved to a Social Democratic housing development in Penzing, in the western part of Vienna.\nPapanek's father was forced into exile following the Austrian Civil War of 1934. Following the Anschluss, the rest of the family fled to Paris in 1938. In September 1940, they emigrated by boat to New York City.\n\n\n=== Military career ===\nAfter graduating high school at age sixteen, Papanek enrolled at Cornell University. When the United States entered World War II, Papanek paused his studies to enlist in the army. He initially trained in the infantry and artillery, but eventually used his native German language skills in military intelligence. After training at Fort Ritchie in Maryland, he was deployed to Germany to find Nazi war criminals.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nPapanek resumed his studies at Cornell following his military service. After graduation, he earned both a master's degree and a PhD in economics from Harvard University, where he studied under John Kenneth Galbraith.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPapanek briefly served in the Agency for International Development within the US State Department before being fired for his socialist leanings. He briefly moved with his family to Karachi, Pakistan, before returning to a position at Harvard University in 1958.\nAt Harvard, Papanek studied income distribution and poverty in developing countries; he specialized in the economies of Indonesia and Pakistan.\nHe also served as director of Harvard's Development Advisory Service.\nIn 1974, Papanek left Harvard to become the chair of economics at Boston University. He led the Boston Institute for Developing Economies for thirty years, advising governments on macroeconomic and microeconomic policies.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPapanek and his wife Hannah (née Kaiser) raised two children, Tom and Joanne.\n\n\n== Works ==\nPakistan's Development, Social Goals, and Private Incentives (1967), Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press.

        "content": "The phenomenon of the Zoroastrian population decline has garnered considerable attention and discussion within academia, literature and journalism. \nA plethora of studies, conducted by both Indian and Western academics, have offered comprehensive insights into the complex dynamics underlying this demographic shift. Despite some segments of the community hesitating to acknowledge this decline, rigorous examination of census data and demographic studies spanning several decades sheds light on various factors contributing to this trend.\n\n\n== Historical Situation ==\nThe Sasanian Empire which was the last Zoroastrian state in Iran, finally succumbed to Arab conquest by 642 CE. Subsequently, a significant migration of Zoroastrians to India occurred, likely in the 8th or 9th century, leading to the establishment of the Parsi community. Scholars like Jamsheed Choksy have hypothesised that the transition from Zoroastrianism to Islam among Iranians post-Arab invasion was gradual, spanning several centuries, based on Islamic biographical dictionaries. Richard Bulliet’s statistical analysis indicates that a mere 8% of urban Iranians were Muslim a century after the Abbasids’ rise to power in 750 CE, with this figure increasing to approximately 80% by the 10th century, although rural areas retained stronger Zoroastrian adherence.\nThe Zoroastrian population continued to decline due to conversions, persecution, and massacres, dwindling to a few thousand by the 19th century. Maneckji Limji Hataria’s 1850s survey found fewer than 7,000 Zoroastrians in Iran. However, improved conditions in the 20th century saw a rebound, with the 1966 census reporting around 20,000 Zoroastrians, over 9,000 of whom resided in Tehran.\nEstimates prior to the 1979 Islamic Revolution ranged between 20,000 and 30,000 Zoroastrians. Post-revolution, the 1981 census reported over 92,000 Zoroastrians, likely inflated due to Baha’is registering as Zoroastrians amidst the Islamic Republic’s non-recognition of Baha’ism. Subsequent censuses have not recorded religious affiliation, necessitating reliance on estimates for current figures. Mobed Firouzgary’s 2004 demographic report for the FEZANA Journal estimated the Zoroastrian population at 24,000, aligning with electoral data. However, migration, particularly of younger individuals, to Western countries due to economic challenges has led to a significant decrease in the Zoroastrian population, leaving an aging community behind. Current estimates suggest no more than 12,000 to 15,000 Zoroastrians remain in Iran, reflecting a serious demographic situation for the religion historically intertwined with the nation.\nThe majority of Zoroastrians in the world are Parsis, the descendants of refugees who migrated to the Indian subcontinent, fleeing religious persecution after the Islamic invasion and destruction of the Sassanian Empire. It is thought, they were economically prosperous in the centuries subsequent to their migration. However, this period was marred by the invasion of Gujarat by Alauddin Khilji, leading to various conflicts, riots and massacres endured by both Parsis and Hindus against invaders. Parsis were a predominantly agricultural community by 1650. Under British rule, Parsis, along with Bhatias, Hindu Banias, Jains, Baghdadi Jews, Bohra, and Khoja Muslims, actively participated in mercantile endeavors, especially in the city of Bombay. Notably, Parsis provided significant support and financial backing to the nascent Indian Independence movement, with leaders such as Dadabhai Naroji, Bhikaji Cama, Phereozeshah Mehta, Khurshed F. Nariman  Ardeshir Godrej and Mithuben Petit. Post-independence, Parsis are known for their patriotism and they have played a leading role in the development of India as a republic, this includes India's first field marshall Sam Manekshaw and architect of India's nuclear program Homi Bhabha. Parsis have been described by various Indian politicians, including Narendra Modi as 'The World's Best Minority'. \nKey studies addressing Parsi population decline include Paul Axelrod's seminal works, such as \"Cultural and Historical Factors in the Population Decline of the Parsis of India\" (1990) and \"Natality and Family Planning in Three Bombay Communities\" (1988), along with other significant contributions like Jayant Kumar Banthia's \"Parsi Demography: Past, Recent, and Future\" (2003) and Chidambara Chandrasekaran's pioneering research on Parsi demography dating back to 1948. These studies collectively underscore a unanimous observation: the precipitous drop in Parsi fertility rates stands as a central driver of the population decline. Every demographic study conducted on the Indian Parsis, who constitute the largest component of the worldwide Zoroastrian community, indicates a steep and steady decline in population due to low fertility rates.\nContrary to biological conjectures, scholarly consensus suggests that low Parsi fertility primarily stems from socio-cultural factors rather than genetic predispositions. Early demographic investigations, such as Chandrasekaran's study, discredited biological explanations, emphasizing instead the influence of social norms and cultural attitudes on fertility rates. Axelrod's subsequent research further corroborated this assertion, in his 1990 publication in the scholarly journal Population Studies, he analyzed statistical findings and determined that “It would appear that Parsi women are not sub-fecund [i.e., more biologically infertile] and, once married, are able to bear children quickly and without difficulty.” When fertility becomes a biological concern within the Parsi community, it often arises from the practice of marrying and attempting to conceive children at an advanced age.\n\n\n== Late Marriage ==\nLate marriage emerges as a salient feature within the Parsi community, with historical records tracing its evolution. While the Parsis, such as Behramji Malbari were pioneers in abandoning the practice of child marriage in the late 19th century, subsequent decades witnessed a progressive delay in the age of marriage. By 1930, the median age of marriage for Parsi women surpassed 24 years, significantly higher than national averages. Current data indicates even higher marriage ages, with the median age standing at 27 for women and 31 for men among Indian Parsis, substantially exceeding the thresholds conducive to population replacement.\nThe trend of late marriages among Parsis has led to a significant increase in the number of individuals who have never married. This phenomenon, as stated by Axelrod, is often a direct result of late marriages, particularly in the case of the Parsis.\n\n\n== Non-marriage ==\nIt has been noted that delaying marriage often increases the likelihood of remaining unmarried. The rates of non-marriage within the Parsi population are striking, attracting the attention of numerous demographers.\nIn 1948, Sapur Faredun Desai, author of “A Community at the Cross-Road”, expressed concern over the increasing rates of unmarried Parsis, which had risen by 40 percent between 1881 and 1931. Chandrasekaran's research shows that by 1931, 16 percent of Parsi women remained unmarried at the end of their reproductive cycle, a significant increase from 6 percent in 1901.\nThis trend was not confined to urban areas like Bombay. Studies conducted in rural Gujarat found that between 13 percent and 55 percent of surveyed women remained unmarried well into middle age.In the 1960s, it was found that the percentage of married Parsis in Karachi was “unusually low” compared to Muslim women of the same age group.\nNon-marriage of Zoroastrians is prevalent across all educational levels, indicating that it was not linked to any particular socioeconomic class. Current figures suggest that the proportion of single people in the Parsi community might be one of the highest in the world.\nIn 1982, a study commissioned by the Bombay Parsi Punchayet (BPP), found that 45 percent of all adult males and 38 percent of all adult females surveyed were never married.\nA similar study conducted by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) in 1999 found that 40 percent of men and 30 percent of Parsis in Greater Mumbai remained unmarried throughout their lives. According to a paper presented by Sayeed Unisa and others in 2009, one out of every five Parsi Indian males, and one out of every ten females, is still unmarried by the age of 50.\n\n\n== Consequences for Fertility Rates and Population ==\nThe decline in fertility rates among the Parsis is considered one of the most dramatic outside of Europe, leading to an unprecedented fall in population numbers.\nThe impact of late marriage and non-marriage on the Parsi population is evident in the fertility rates, which are well below the replacement level necessary to sustain the population. In 1881, the birthrate for Parsis in Bombay was 34 per 1000 population, which dropped to 25 per 1000 population by 1926 and further slid to 12 per 1000 population by the 1960s. By 1961, due to late marriage or non-marriage, the births to Parsi women in Greater Bombay were only 50 percent of the number that would have occurred if every woman were married throughout her reproductive period.\nThe situation worsened in the following decades. By 1980-82, the total fertility rate (TFR) for Parsis was already 1.12, about half of the replacement level, and it further declined to 0.94 in 2000. Recent data from 2001-06 observed a TFR of 0.88, a figure that is significantly lower than the TFRs of total populations in countries like South Korea and Japan, which are known to have serious demographic decline.\nThe low fertility rate has resulted in an aging Parsi population and a dramatic shift in the age distribution. Despite the decline in fertility rates since the 1880s, the Parsi population in India continued to grow until the 1950s due to lower mortality rates and longer life expectancy. However, as the number of elderly Parsis increased, new generations of Parsi children became smaller. By 2001, one in every eight Parsis was a child under the age of 15, whereas one in every four Parsis was aged 65 and above.\nAs these trends continue, the Parsi community in India will see a significant decline in population numbers in the coming decades. Projections suggest that by 2051, only 32,000 Parsis will remain in India, less than half of the current population. Similarly another prediction is that, the Parsi population of Bombay, which was 46,557 in 2001, is projected to decline to 20,122. Dinshaw Tamboly, the Chairman of The WZO Trust Funds has reckoned by the end of the 21st century there will only be 9,995 Parsis left in India.\n\n\n== Out-Migration ==\nDue to the sheer magnitude of the departure, out-migration now seems to be significantly contributing to Iran's Zoroastrian population decline. This is the same for Pakistan and since the 1960s, out-migration has been observed as a significant cause in the decline of the relatively tiny community, centered in Karachi which was in the erstwhile Bombay presidency. As of 2009 it has been documented 95% of Pakistani Zoroastrian youth are making the decision to leave their homeland. Zoroastrians who stay in Karachi are noted to face economic discrimination based on their religious indentity.\nWhile some academics, acknowledge that migration may have a role in India, they also point out that it is very challenging to quantify and evaluate and it doesn't seem to be all that relevant.Undoubtedly, at least 95% of young people in India are choosing to remain on the country's soil. Unisa, et al. made the decision to search statistics on Parsi age distribution for telltale indicators of significant out-migration in light of the tone of the discussion in India. Between 1961 and 2001, they discovered \"no significant distortions in the age pattern\"—that is, there were no anomalous declines in the population of young adult age cohorts.\nConsequently, they came to the conclusion that, while an accurate evaluation is impossible, \"migration does not appear to be a reason for the decline in Parsi population in the recent past.\" Based on the data previously provided in this research, it is also highly probable that out-migration is not enough to explain the demographic reduction in India, given the sharp decline in Zoroastrian populations globally. Thus, out-migration contributes to the fall in the Indian Parsi population, but not significantly.\n\n\n== Intermarriage ==\nIn recent decades, few many neighbourhood concerns have generated as much debate as this one. India has undoubtedly seen a rise in the number of interfaith marriages. When Sapur Faredun Desai wrote his book in 1948, intermarriage was hardly recorded. However, by 1991, it accounted for 19% of all Parsi weddings in Bombay, and by 2005, 31%. The numbers seem to be greater for other parts of India. Our demographers acknowledge once more how difficult it is to pinpoint the exact effects of intermarriage. However, academics like Axelrod are certain that although statistics on out-migration and intermarriage might be \"substantial\" on their own, they \"are not sufficient to account entirely for the population decline.\"\nDr. Zubin Shroff attempted to quantify the proportionate influence of intermarriage on the future population of the Bombay community in his 2010  paper.According to Shroff's demographic predictions for 2051, only the offspring of Parsi males who had married outside of their family would be accepted as Zoroastrians, while the children of both men and women who had married outside of their family would be accepted. His conclusions are rather startling. Regardless of whether offspring from any marriages are accepted, he found that \"the Parsi population will decline sharply over the next few decades, given current fertility trends.\" The birth rate within the community is so low that the inclusion of children from intermarried couples scarcely impacts the situation.\nGiven current fertility and intermarriage rates, Bombay's population in 2051 will be 19,136 if no children of any married pair are accepted, 20,122 if only children of married women are disqualified, and 20,535 if all intermarriage children are accepted.\nShroff concludes that both liberals and conservatives have overstated the role of intermarriage in the community's population decline, while the community's \"abysmally low fertility\" has actually \"brought the community to the so-called demographic brink.\" If rates of intermarriage keep rising and the long-term offspring of these marriages—children and grandkids, for instance—are not brought up as Zoroastrians, intermarriage may very well be a reason for worry to the community, including the population in diaspora within North America. \n\n\n== Childless Couples ==\nA significant proportion of Parsi couples have no children, with a 1999 study by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) revealing that 12 percent of married Parsi women are childless. This high rate of childlessness is attributed to both biological fertility issues and deliberate avoidance of pregnancies.\nThe Parsi community, considering itself enlightened, has shown less prejudice and more acceptance towards openly gay members compared to other Indian communities. This acceptance may contribute to a higher visibility of gay Parsis compared to other Indian communities where discrimination and social stigma persist.There is no scientific evidence to support a claim of a high rate of homosexuality within the Parsi community, particularly among men.\nThe issue of religious conversion also plays a role in the Parsi community’s demographic trends. Contrary to the myth of widespread conversion to Zoroastrianism in regions such as Central Asia and Russia, the reality is that conversion remains a rare occurrence. In Iran, conversion is punishable under the Islamic Republic, and there is no significant evidence of Muslim Iranians in the diaspora converting to Zoroastrianism.\n\n\n== Conversion from Zoroastrianism ==\nThroughout history, there have been notable instances of individuals from the Zoroastrian faith adopting other larger religions. A significant number of Zoroastrians in Iran, for example, embraced Baha’ism in the late 19th century. The initial documented instance of conversion occurred during the 1880s and involved a Yazd merchant by the name of Kay Khosro Khodadad. Amighi points out the absence of precise statistics regarding Zoroastrian conversions but suggests that the figure was likely substantial. According to Amighi’s findings, in Yazd, about 30 percent of the Zoroastrian families had a minimum of one Baha’i member within their broader family network. \nAdditionally, Zoroastrians in Iran have been persistently coerced to convert to Islam. In Iran, there have been reports of government-sponsored or sanctioned efforts to convert religious minorities, including Zoroastrians, to Islam. These initiatives may involve financial incentives or other forms of persuasion aimed at encouraging conversion. The Iranian educational system predominantly follows Islamic teachings and practices, which can create an environment where non-Muslim students, including Zoroastrians, feel pressure to conform to Islamic norms. Consequently, Zoroastrians may face employment or advancement barriers in certain fields if they openly practice their faith. Employers may prefer candidates who align more closely with the dominant Islamic culture, leading Zoroastrians to downplay or conceal their religious identity to avoid discrimination.\nThe Parsi community witnessed a surge in conversions to Christianity in the 1830s, a movement initiated by the missionary John Wilson and continued well into the 20th century. This included prominent individuals such as Sir Ness Wadia, father of Neville Wadia and Nadir Dinshaw. Other notable religious conversions from Zoroastrianism include Minocher K Spencer to Hinduism and Rattanbai Jinnah to Islam. \nWhile there are no accurate statistics on the number of individuals formally leaving the religion, anecdotal evidence suggests that the number is extremely limited. However, a more significant concern may be the number of individuals who, due to apathy or irreligiosity, do not pass on Zoroastrianism to their children. This trend could have long-term implications for the community’s religious continuity.\n\n\n== Potential Solutions ==\nThe decline in Parsi fertility rates has been a known issue among scholars for over six decades, with numerous studies confirming a drastic population slide.\nThere are many potential solutions, which can be broadly categorized into organizational and individual actions.\nOrganizational Actions\nCommunity resources and organizations must be harnessed to arrest the population decline. This primarily involves adults in the community, particularly those in positions of leadership. Some community leaders have already undertaken commendable work to encourage marriage and childbirth and to make housing more accessible to young couples in Bombay. However, more needs to be done, and the rest of the community needs to participate. Community organizations play a crucial role in prioritizing youth issues and promoting marriage and childbearing. In India, the Bombay Parsi Panchayat (BPP) has initiated successful programs such as the Zoroastrian Youth for the Next Generation (ZYNG). Similarly, the Federation of Zoroastrian Associations of North America (FEZANA) has supported youth efforts through organizations like the Zoroastrian Youth of North America (ZYNA).\nThe Jiyo Parsi Scheme is a unique initiative launched by the Ministry of Minority Affairs in 2013 to address the declining population of the Parsi community in India. The scheme aims to reverse this trend by adopting a scientific protocol and structured interventions. It comprises three components: an Advocacy Component that includes workshops and advertisement campaigns to create awareness, a Health of the Community Component which covers childcare, creche support, and assistance to the elderly, and a Medical Component that provides financial assistance for the detection and treatment of infertility, fertility treatment. The scheme offers cash assistance to encourage Parsi couples to have children, regardless of their financial status. \nPromoting Youth Interaction\nPromoting interaction among the youth of the community is a key strategy. Unlike in India, Iran, or Pakistan, Zoroastrians in the diaspora are not concentrated in specific cities or neighborhoods, making regular interaction a challenge. Local Zoroastrian associations can support and fund activities for youth and young adults, organize regional youth meetings, and facilitate participation in congresses and events.\nCreating Infrastructure to Promote Marriage\nAddressing the issue of finding suitable matches within the community is another important aspect. The creation of a comprehensive, user-friendly, and regularly updated Zoroastrian matrimonial website could be a potential solution. Such a portal could promote cooperation among different Zoroastrian associations worldwide.\nIndividual Responsibility\nThe youth of the community have a significant role to play. The drastic decline in Parsi fertility is not due to biological reasons but cultural and attitudinal ones. If falling numbers are due to cultural norms and attitudes toward marriage and family, then attitudes can change. The process of decline can be stopped and eventually reversed if fertility rates increase. This is achievable, as shown in studies by Zubin Shroff and Sayeeda Unisa, et al., though it will require a substantial increase in current fertility rates.\nHere are some steps individuals can take, which have been suggested by Dr Dinyar Patel:\n\nGet married: Marriage is an important institution in any community. A significant proportion of potential fertility is lost if a substantial percentage of women never marry.\nDo not delay marriage until a late age: It becomes increasingly difficult and risky to have children the longer one waits. If one wants to have a family, it is best to start looking for a potential partner at a relatively earlier age.\nTry to find a Zoroastrian spouse: A union between two Zoroastrians is most likely to result in offspring who are raised as Zoroastrian and in the community’s culture and traditions.\nHave children: A total fertility rate (TFR) of 2.1 is necessary for the replacement of a population. The current TFR for Parsis is below 1.0, so the Parsis are well below the replacement level. Couples should be encouraged to have at least two children\nRaise children as Zoroastrians: Individuals should strive to pass on their religion, tradition, and culture to a new generation.\n\n\n== Defining Zoroastrian Identity ==\nThe definition of who is considered a Parsi or a Zoroastrian has been a subject of debate. In 1908, Justice Dinshaw Davar made a significant decision in what is known as the Parsi Punchayet Case (Petit v Jijibhai). This judicial case indirectly dealt with the admission of non-Zoroastrian spouses, including the French wife of R.D. Tata, into the Parsi community.  Rather than relying on religious texts or precedent, Justice Davar defined Parsis as a patriarchal community. The question of defining who was a Zoroastrian and a Parsi arose again in the 1915-18 Rangoon Navjote case, which involved Bella, a child of a Parsi mother and a Goan Christian father. Initially, the Burma court sided with Bella’s supporters, affirming her status as a Zoroastrian. However, after a series of appeals, the Privy Court ultimately accepted Justice Davar’s definition.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPersecution of Zoroastrians\nParsis\nIranis (India)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCategory:Demographics\nCategory:Majority–minority relations\nCategory:Zoroastrianism\nCategory:Population decline",

        "content": "Arkham Intelligence is a public data application that enables users to analyze blockchain and cryptocurrency activity. Founded by Miguel Morel in 2020, the company's platform utilizes AI to identify and catalog the owners of blockchain addresses.\nArkham was the first company to identify wallets owned by digital asset ETFs.  Its partners include TradingView, Polygon, and Avalanche.\n\n\n== History ==\nMorel founded Arkham in 2020 and received investments from Tim Draper, Joe Lonsdale of Palantir Technologies, and a co-founder of OpenAI.\nIn July 2022, during the midst of Celsius Network’s bankruptcy, Arkham found that Celsius owed over $500 million worth of digital assets to three of the biggest DeFi lenders, including Aave Protocol; it was also reported that Celsius worked with a previously unidentified fund manager to purchase NFTs and make deposits on yield-bearing decentralized exchanges.\nArkham reported on a hacker who stole approximately $477 million worth of tokens from FTX and sent 180,000 Ethereum (ETH) coins to at least a dozen digital wallets in November 2022. Arkham analysts noted that the hacker followed two patterns: operating between 08:00 and 10:00 UTC and creating new accounts for each operation.\nIn December 2022, Arkham tracked over $1 million of transferred funds tied to former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried as well as $1.7 million worth of cryptocurrencies liquidated within a 24-hour time span.\nArkham provided data in January 2023 that identified “an alleged nexus of money laundering” from Bitzlato through intermediate wallets of Binance. Over the course of several years, it was found that the intermediary wallet deposited $15 million worth of crypto onto Binance's platform. That same month, Arkham released a report which revealed that Alameda liquidators lost $72,000 worth of crypto while trying to recover funds as part of FTX's bankruptcy.\nIn January 2024, Arkham tracked over $1 million worth of bitcoin sent to Satoshi Nakamoto; this was the first reported activity from Nakamoto since December 2010. This data was used by prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, who filed criminal charges against Bankman-Fried for his role in FTX's collapse.\nIn February 2024, Arkham publicly identified nearly $1 billion transferred from wallets seized by the U.S. government as part of the Bitfinex hack.\nOther notable blockchain identifications include: Donald Trump, Robinhood,  Tesla, SpaceX, and Justin Sun.\n\n\n== References ==",

He showed promise in the school team, and so he was transferred to Ganjingzi Youth Sports School to pursue a footballing career.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Dalian Transcendence ===\nAt the start of the 2018 season, Li Ning was named in the first-team squad for China League One side Dalian Transcendence. On 10 April 2018, Li Ning, aged 16 years and 172 days, started the game and provided an assist on his debut for Dalian Transcendence in a Chinese FA Cup third round tie with Sichuan Jiuniu, becoming the youngest ever player to make an appearance, as well as becoming the youngest ever assist provider, in the competition. He made his league debut for Dalian Transcendence on 28 October 2018, in a match against Beijing Enterprises.\n\n\n=== Shenzhen ===\nAfter the dissolution of Dalian Transcendence after the 2018 season, Li Ning joined the Shenzhen youth setup. In the 2022 Chinese Super League season, Li was promoted to the Shenzhen first-team. On 19 December 2022, he made his debut for Shenzhen in an 8–0 loss against Shandong Taishan. Under manager Chen Tao in the 2023 season, Li Ning gained more playing time with the club, making 24 appearances in all competitions. In a league match against Dalian Pro on 13 May 2023, Li Ning provided an assist for Frank Acheampong in the 92nd minute to secure all three points for Shenzhen. On 8 July 2023, Li Ning was sent off in a match against Beijing Guoan in the 41st minute, as Shenzhen went on to lose the game 5–0. At the end of the season, Li Ning's Shenzhen experienced relegation from the Chinese Super League in the 2023 season, and subsequently folded in January 2024.\n\n\n=== Meizhou Hakka ===\nOn 27 February 2024, Li Ning made a free transfer to Chinese Super League side Meizhou Hakka. Li Ning made his debut for Meizhou Hakka on 3 March 2024, in a league game that ended in a 2–0 loss to Shanghai Shenhua.

        "content": "Vera Larminie (1881–1964) was one of the earliest women to be admitted as a Member of the Royal Geographical Society, in 1913. Larminie was also known for a volume of poetry she wrote with her sister, the novelist and Badminton champion Margaret Tragett. In the early 1900s Larminie worked at the Society for Psychical Research. In her later life Larminie worked as a scientific card indexer at the British Museum (Natural History).\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nVera Larminie was born on 20 or 23 June 1881 in Sheffield, Yorkshire. Her parents were Edward Merry Larminie (c.1841-1905), who was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Engineers, and Laura Frances Marshall (née Pollock, 1846–1912), who had married in 1878. Larminie's full siblings were: Stanley Graham Larminie (c.1879-1929), Lionel Edward Larminie (1883–1926) Marcus John Larminie (b. & d. 1884) and Margaret Rivers Larminie (1885–1964, married name Margaret Tragett).\nLarminie's mother Laura had been divorced in 1878 by her first husband Charles Henry Tilson Marshall after she began a romance with Edward Merry Larminie, and she had lost custody of the children from her marriage to Marshall including Larminie's half siblings the writer Maud Diver (1867–1945) and the entomologist Guy Anstruther Knox Marshall (1871–1959). Larminie's maternal grandfather was Sir Frederick Pollock (1783–1870), lawyer and at one time Attorney General.\n\n\n== Career ==\nLarminie was trained as a secretary, and she was fluent in English and French. Larminie was an assistant secretary at the Society for Psychical Research from 1903 to 1905, when she had to resign on the grounds of ill-health. While working at the Society, Larminie participated in, and helped to record, experiments to investigate Telepathy conducted by Northcote Whitridge Thomas. Larminie also translated work by Joseph Grasset from French to English for the Society's Proceedings.\nIn 1913 the Royal Geographical Society, after many years of wrestling with the decision, decided to formally admit female members of whom Larminie was among the earliest, being admitted on 24 November 1913. Larminie was also elected as a Member of the Geologist's Association in 1919. Larminie's signature appears on page 24 of a social scrapbook album made by the geologist Mary Sophia Johnston (1875–1955) at the start of the twentieth century, alongside Marie Stopes and Dorothea Bate, and many others.\nIn 1918 Larminie published a book of poetry with her sister Margaret Rivers Larminie, titled Out of the East: And Other Poems. The volume was published as part of the academic publisher Blackwell's 'Adventurer's All' series, intended to showcase new poets. Although reviewed positively, with Vera considered to have a more direct voice than Margaret, this was the only work of poetry that the sisters ever published, and Vera's only published creative work, although Margaret went on to have a successful career as a novelist.\n\nIn 1921 Larminie attempted to emigrate to Canada to work as a smallholder and beekeeper, although initially she had been offered employment as a secretary at the Womans Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She returned to the U.K. after about a year. Larminie did not lose her interest in insects and in 1930 she recorded the caddisfly species Halesus radiatus in County Down, Ireland which was quoted in a scientific paper by Douglas Kimmins in 1932.\nIn 1932 Larminie moved into accommodation run by Women's Pioneer Housing, 65 Harrington Gardens in Kensington, staying there until about 1937 when she moved to Putney to live with her sister Margaret, who had by then divorced her husband Robert Tragett.\nOn the 1939 register of England, Larminie was listed as living on independent means in Richmond and working as an unpaid scientific card indexer at the British Museum (Natural History).\nIn later life Larminie lived at Bexhill-on-Sea, and she died at Hastings on 12 June 1964.\n\n\n== Works ==\n1904: [as translator from the French original]: Dr. J.

Paul, showing three children getting up to mischief in a Victorian style home.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe film is around a minute long. It shows a mother tucking her two sons into bed, when suddenly their sister runs into the bedroom and tickles their faces. When they wake up, she hides under the bed. Both boys think it was each other and start a pillow fight ripping the pillows apart. The mother then comes in and disciplines the boys and finds the girl hiding under the bed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "I Gusti Ngurah Jaya Negara (born 4 July 1966) is an Indonesian politician from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle who is the current mayor of Denpasar, Bali, having served since 2021. Before becoming mayor, he had been the city's vice mayor under Ida Bagus Rai Mantra for two terms, from 2010 to 2015 and 2016–2021, and before that he was elected twice to the city's legislature.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nI Gusti Ngurah Jaya Negara was born on 4 July 1966 in Puri Penatih district of Denpasar to I Gusti Ngurah Gde Sutedja and Ni Jero Samiata. His father was a teacher, and his mother was a housewife. He stated that during his childhood, he helped his parents earn money by selling ice pops after school and helping during harvests. His father lost his job as a teacher in 1971 due to his affiliation to the Indonesian National Party, and became an auto rickshaw driver. Negara graduated from Denpasar's State High School No. 1 in 1985, and in 1991 he graduated with a bachelors in economics from the National Education University in Denpasar. During his studies, his father involved him in the party activities of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter receiving his degree, Negara began to work at a private bank. The bank failed due to the Asian financial crisis and Negara was laid off. In the 1999 legislative election shortly after, he was elected as a member of the Denpasar City Regional House of Representatives as a member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P; a continuation of PDI). He was reelected for a second term in 2004, and became chairman of one of the House's commissions. In 2010, he ran as the running mate to Ida Bagus Rai Mantra in Denpasar's mayoral election, and the pair won with 72.5% of the votes. They were sworn into office on 11 August 2010. They were reelected in 2015, and were sworn in to their second term on 17 February 2016.\nIn the 2020 mayoral election, Negara ran to become the mayor of Denpasar and was elected with 184,655 votes (81.2%) with I Kadek Agus Arya Wibawa as his running mate. They were sworn in on 26 February 2021. His early tenure as mayor focused on vaccination and economic aid programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to renovations to facilities at Sanur Beach.\n\n\n== Family ==\nTwo of his younger siblings are active in politics and government: his sister I Gusti Ayu Bintang Darmawati in 2019 was appointed as Minister of Women Empowerment and Child Protection in Joko Widodo's cabinet, and his brother I Gusti Ngurah Gede Marhaendra Jaya was elected into the Bali Regional House of Representatives as a PDI-P legislator in the 2024 Indonesian legislative election. Through Darmawati, Negara is brother-in-law of former minister, Bali vice governor, and Denpasar mayor Anak Agung Gede Ngurah Puspayoga.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Channing Russel (February 23, 1814 – February 24, 1896) was an American historian and lawyer who served as the first vice president of Cornell University from 1870 to 1881. He was also the university's acting president during the absence of Andrew Dickson White. Russel worked closely with White on structuring Cornell in the university's early years.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWilliam Channing Russel was born on February 23, 1814. He was named after the clergyman William Ellery Channing, his uncle. Russel attended Columbia College and graduated with an AM in 1832. He next attended Harvard Law School. After graduating, Russel practiced law in New York City.\nBy 1865, Russel was working in the US government's Freedmen's Bureau. Shortly after the end of the Civil War, he took a job as chair of history at the Antioch College. In 1868, the newly established Cornell University hired Russel as a professor of South European languages and associate professor of history, making him one of the university's first two professors. Cornell historian Morris Bishop wrote that Russel's job title marked the \"first use of the term 'associate professor' in American higher education.\" He was also named vice president of the university in 1870, a role he had been de facto carrying out since 1868. Russel was also involved in planning for the university's establishment, and traveled to Germany to study the structure of their universities' history departments. In his capacity as vice president, he served as acting president while Cornell's first president, Andrew Dickson White, was abroad. Russel also urged the adoption of an 'elective system' of curriculum, and closely advised White, for instance urging the admittance of women to the university.\nIn early 1881, Russel was forced to resign by the Cornell University Board of Trustees with little explanation. He continued to discuss issues concerning the university with White. Shortly afterwards, Russel was hired as the chair of Brown University's history department, a role he held for two years.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nRussel had seven children. He died on February 24, 1896.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKeller, Dorothy Jean.

He began his British leagues career riding for Motherwell Eagles during the 1951 Speedway National League Division Two season. He joined Motherwell through his connection with his friend Jack Young.\nScott spent four seasons at Motherwell, although during the last season, the team were known as the Lanarkshire Eagles. He returned home to Australia for the winter of 1954 before learning that Motherwell were closing due to financial losses.\nSubsequently, he was subject to interest from Coventry Bees but secured a transfer to Southampton Saints for the 1955 season and then finished the season with Ipswich Witches. \nScott returned to race in Australia and remained there until 1963, when he was signed by Reg Fearman for the Long Eaton Archers. He averaged 7.16 for Long Eaton before switching to Middlesbrough Bears in 1964.\nScott sealed an exchange transfer to Glasgow Tigers in 1965 for the inaugural British League season, trading places with Ray Cresp. His final season was with Glasgow in 1966.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Salvador de Guerra was a Franciscan missionary to New Spain. He was investigated and sentenced in 1655 for abuse of the Hopi at his mission. Later, he served as secretary to Alonso de Posada, and was involved with the Inquisition investigation of Governor Bernardo López de Mendizábal.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGuerra was stationed in 1652 at a mission near Shongopovi, Arizona, where he served as resident missionary to the local Hopi.\n\n\n=== Investigation for abuse ===\nIn 1655, a group of native leaders came to Antonio de Ibargaray, the custos of New Mexico, with reports of abuse by Guerra. Other native witnesses confirmed that Guerra habitually used whipping and tarring with hot turpentine  as a punishment on the natives, \"especially boys and girls guilty of immoral conduct.\" Most recently, Guerra had punished Juan Cuna, a Hopi from Oraibi village, for \"idolatry\". Guerra had publicly beaten him until Cuna was \"bathed in blood\", beaten him a second time inside the church, and then tarred him with burning turpentine; Cuna had died from the treatment. One account claimed that Guerra had deliberately ridden Cuna down with his horse and killed him, in order to prevent him from reporting to secular authorities.\nWhen questioned, Guerra confirmed his use of beating and tarring as punishments, especially when he found evidence of traditional Hopi religious practice in the form of feathers or kachina dolls. He denied the additional Hopi accusation that, when using their labor for the weaving of mantas, he provided insufficient material and beat them if they wove too slowly. On July 17, Ibargaray concluded the investigation, and ordered that Guerra appear before the superiors of the order in Mexico City for punishment.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nGuerra was subsequently confined for some time in the mission at Quarai, and temporarily forbidden from saying Mass. He was then transferred to Jemez Pueblo, and subsequently served at several missions in New Mexico, including San Agustín de la Isleta. Another Franciscan, Benito de la Natividad, described an incident at Isleta, in which Guerra attempted to interfere in the Hopi kachina dance:\n\nFray Salvador de Guerra, not being able to restrain them in any other way, went throughout the pueblo with a cross upon his shoulders, a crown of thorns, and a rope about his neck, beating his naked body, in order that they might stop the dance. When he reached a certain part of the pueblo, they came after him weeping, and saying that they were not to blame, because the governor had commanded them to do as they were doing.\nIn 1661, Guerra was assigned as secretary to Alonso de Posada. In that capacity, he was involved with the Inquisition investigation of Governor Bernardo López de Mendizábal.

        "content": "Mario Dal Fabbro (October 6, 1913 – June 20, 1990) was an Italian American modernist sculptor, furniture designer, and author of illustrated how-to books on furniture design and construction. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDal Fabbro was born in Cappella Maggiore in the Veneto region of Italy on October 6, 1913. His parents were Pietro and Luigia Fiorina (Gava) Dal Fabbro. In his youth, he worked in the family furniture shop. He studied art and design at the Royal Superior Institute for Industrial Arts in Venice and the Regio Magistero Artistico in Milan and graduated with high honors from the Institute in 1935 and Regio in 1937. \n\n\n== Career ==\nBetween 1938 and 1948, Dal Fabbro achieved recognition in Italy as an exponent of creative contemporary furniture design, designing pieces for private individuals and Milan furniture houses. He participated in the Triennale di Milano competition in 1939 and 1947 and won the Garzanti competition for the standardization of furniture. During this period he also contributed to the Italian architecture and design publications Domus and Stile and the French architecture magazine L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui. He also served in the Italian Army during World War II.\nIn 1948, Dal Fabbro immigrated to the United States, where he became an American citizen in 1951 and worked for 20 years as an industrial designer of furniture for Knoll and Paul McCobb and as a department head at JG Furniture in New York City and Allentown, Pennsylvania, where he resided from 1948 into the 1970s. His modernist designs were simple and practical with clean lines. In 1968, he retired from industry to become an independent sculptor, crafting abstract organic forms and kinetic structures in wood, which he exhibited but never allowed to be sold during his lifetime. \nThe Allentown Art Museum featured 30 of his works at a 1972 solo exhibition and added several to its permanent collections. The Kemerer Museum of Decorative Arts exhibited his work in 1976. His work was also exhibited at the Museum of Art, Science, and Industry in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In 2012, the New York gallery Maison Gerard exhibited works by Dal Fabbro and other artists \"little known outside the collector’s market but whose work is important and noteworthy today.\" Sotheby's, Christie's, Wright, and other auction houses have sold his works. In 1984, Dal Fabbro co-founded the Fairfield County Art Association in Fairfield, Connecticut. In 1986, Fairfield University named him the Fairfield Artist of the Year.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nIn 1949, Dal Fabro published his first English-language book, Modern Furniture: Its Design and Construction (McGraw Hill, 1949). The title went through four printings and sold 15,000 copies within three years of publication. Later books included How to Build Modern Furniture (1951), Furniture for Modern Interiors (1952), How to Make Built-in Furniture (1955), How to Make Children's Furniture and Play Equipment (1963), and Upholstered Furniture: Design and Construction (1969). McGraw Hill, John Murray, F. W. Dodge, Reinhold, Gorlich, and other presses published his books, which were released in Italy, Spain and England as well as the U.S. He regularly contributed to The New York Times and House & Garden and wrote for Popular Science, McCall's, Mechanix Illustrated, and Encyclopædia Britannica, coauthoring the section on furniture-making in a 1950s release of the encyclopedia. \nAimed at hobbyists as well as professional designers, Dal Fabbro's books received praise in the popular press. Library Journal described his two-volume How to Build Modern Furniture as \"invaluable reference material\" with \"easy to follow instructions.\" The New York Public Library included the title on a list of \"one hundred best technical books.\" A 1950 review in American Artist said of Modern Furniture that \"the hobbyist, or architect on a busman's holiday, will find many hours of diversion in the section on furniture he can build. It is also a serious reference book for the architect interested in modern design in furniture.\" A 1969 review in The Morning Call noted that Upholstered Furniture \"meets needs of both the professional and the serious home craftsman.\" A 1954 review in the San Francisco Examiner praised Furniture for Modern Interiors for providing \"a general, but inclusive view of what is northworthy among all the furniture produced in this country as well as elsewhere in the world. It avoids monotonous documentation, however.\" \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDal Fabbro married Allentown native Helen Rose (Dell Antonia) Dal Fabbro in Italy on May 9, 1944. The couple had one daughter.\nHe retired to Fairfield, Connecticut, and died in Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on June 20, 1990, at the age of 76.\n\n\n== References ==",

It encompasses a group of about 50 massive hot young stars. These stars are among the largest stars known anywhere in the Universe and appear as bright blue-white in colour. The stars in turn have given birth to new stars within dark globules. NGC 1761 is particularly noteworthy for its intense ultraviolet radiation, which has eroded a large hole in the surrounding nebular material. It is similar in structure to the more famous Rosette Nebula. \nIt is part of a large region of stars called LMC-N11 (N11) which was discovered with a 23-cm telescope by the astronomer James Dunlop in 1826 and was also observed by John Herschel in 1835.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to NGC 1761 at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Awasthia is a monotypic fungal genus in the family Physciaceae. It contains the single species Awasthia melanotricha, a foliose lichen found in the Nepal Himalayas.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis lichen was first formally described by the Indian lichenologist Dharani Dhar Awasthi in 1957. He gathered the type specimen from above the banks of the Saju Pokhari near Topke Gola, at an elevation ranging from 4,520 and 4,575 metres (14,829 and 15,010 ft), thriving on moist sandy soil alongside mosses and grasses. Awasthi chose the species epithet melanotricha following a suggestion from Adolf Hugo Magnusson. Ted Esslinger circumscribed Awasthia in 1978 to contain the species, characterised by its unusually branched rhizines and the presence of the substances gyrophoric and lecanoric acids. The genus names honours Awasthi, \"well known Indian lichenologist, a student of the Physciaceae, and the collector of the type material\". Esslinger noted that due to the lack of apothecia and spores, the placement of the genus in the Physciaceae was to be considered tentative.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAwasthia melanotricha is a foliose lichen, meaning its body (thallus) is leaf-like and loosely attaches to its substrate. It forms nearly circular patches, typically measuring 4–5 cm (1.6–2.0 in) across, with lobes that rise slightly from the surface. These lobes are intricately branched in a pattern that resembles repeated forks (subdichotomously branched) and are often layered over each other (imbricated). Each lobe is typically 1.5–2 mm wide, narrowing to about 1 mm at the tips, and has a gently channeled (canaliculate) surface extending to its ends, giving them a concave appearance on the upper side. The edges of the lobes are generally smooth but may be slightly uneven.\nWhen moist, the thallus is leathery and flexible but becomes brittle when dry. In preserved (herbarium) specimens, the lobes may twist around to reveal the underside. The upper surface of the thallus is smooth, dark greyish-brown to brownish-black, often lighter at the tips. The underside is black, densely covered with short, black, branched, and rough-surfaced hair-like outgrowths (rhizines]) that are about 1 mm long and 0.1 mm thick at the base. The lichen does not produce soredia or isidia, which are structures used by some lichens for reproduction.\nThe thallus structure includes a top layer (upper cortex) made of tightly packed, roundish to slightly angular cells, creating a protective covering about 16–20 μm thick. Below this, there is a layer of green algal cells (genus Protococcus), each up to 10 μm in size, forming an algal layer about 20–25 μm thick that aids in photosynthesis. The central layer (medulla) consists of tightly packed, longitudinally aligned fungal filaments (hyphae), appearing compact in cross-section and sometimes resembling the upper cortex due to their density. These hyphae are about 4 μm thick with thick walls. Below the cortex, the structure becomes more loosely packed (plectenchymatous) and darker. Chemical spot tests on the upper cortex and medulla show no reaction, indicating the absence of certain lichen products often used for identification. Awasthia melanotricha is sterile, meaning it does not produce reproductive structures (apothecia) typical of many lichens.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Old-age and survivors insurance- OASI (French: AVS) constitutes one of the main social security schemes in Switzerland.\nThe federal law on OASI was passed on December 20, 1946, and approved by popular vote on July 6, 1947, by almost 80% of the votes. It was subsequently harmonized and coordinated with the federal law on disability insurance adopted in 1959. A series of ordinances, the most important being the regulation on old-age and survivors insurance, specifies this.\nFrom the January 1, 1948, date of its entry into force, this legislation underwent numerous modifications. Until 1974, the evolution of the OASI was a fairly accurate reflection of the post-war economic boom. Between 1975 and 2008, the OASI was subject to ten actual revisions and three minor legislative revisions. An 11th revision is under discussion in 2009.\nThis is a pay-as-you-go pension system, the law on occupational pensions (2nd pillar) being a funded pension system. The OASI also allows for a (partial) redistribution of wealth. According to the Federal Social Insurance Office, the OASI is “the most important branch of the Swiss social insurance system”.\n\n\n== Mandatory contribution ==\nAll people carrying out gainful activity in Switzerland are required to contribute, as well as, under certain conditions, people working abroad on behalf of an employer in Switzerland. Since January 1, 1997, date of entry into force of the last (10th) revision of the OASI, widows and married women without gainful activity are now subject to the obligation to contribute. However, the contributions of a married woman without gainful activity are considered to be paid if the husband is in gainful activity and has paid at least double the minimum contribution. This rule is independent of sex: the husband without gainful activity of a woman who exercises gainful activity also does not pay a contribution if his wife has paid at least double the minimum contribution. Contributions are not capped and represent 8.7% of income for employees (paid equally between the employee and the employer) and 8.1% for the self-employed. People domiciled in Switzerland, but not engaged in gainful activity, are also required to pay contributions based on assets and income acquired in the form of an annuity. The minimum contribution for non-active people is between  CHF 478 and CHF 23,900  per year.\n\n\n== History of the OASI ==\n\n\n=== Before the introduction of the OASI ===\n\nUntil the 19th century, it generally fell to families, charities and churches to care for elderly people unable to work. There was also a rudimentary system of public assistance for the needy, although the rules were often restrictive. Between 1883 and 1889, Otto von Bismarck established social insurance (sickness, accidents, disability and old age) in Germany. At the same time, voices were raised in Switzerland to demand the establishment of social measures making it possible, in particular, to fight against the glaring poverty of working families. In 1890 the first constitutional basis for health and accident insurance was thus created. However, it took more than twenty years (1912) for a law to be accepted by the people and for this assurance to become reality.\nThe introduction of old-age and survivors insurance was among the demands of the 1918 general strike.\nThe constitutional basis of the OASI was created in 1925; a first project, however, was rejected by the people in 1931. During the Second World War (1939–1945), the Federal Council took advantage of its extraordinary powers to promote the development of social insurance. This is how he created the allowance schemes for loss of salary and earnings intended for the military – which today have become allowances for loss of earnings –, the organization and method of financing of which served as the basis for the OASI. On July 6, 1947, during a second vote, the federal law on old-age and survivors insurance (LAVS in french) was widely accepted by the people. It came into force on January 1st of the following year.\n\n\n=== Since the establishment of the OASI (criar referencias) ===\nSince 1948, the LAVS has been revised ten times. Originally, the maximum pension was 40 francs, which would currently be equivalent, taking inflation into account, to 183 francs.\nThe minimum pension today amounts to 1,175 francs. During the 7th revision of the OASI (1969), the amount of pensions was increased to 220 francs. During the 8th revision (1973), pensions were increased by 80% and, two years later, by another 25%. Combined with additional benefits, introduced in 1966, the OASI pension guarantees the minimum subsistence level, in accordance with the aim enshrined in the Constitution. Since the 9th revision of the OASI, pensions are regularly adapted to inflation and price changes. In 1997, the 10th revision introduced the individual pension system, as well as income splitting. Each person thus receives their own pension, whatever their marital status, and the income received during the period of marriage is divided by two and allocated to both spouses. The measure constitutes a big step forward, particularly for divorced women. In addition, bonuses for educational and assistance tasks have been introduced. They supplement the pension-forming income of people who take care of a child under 16 years old. The improvements did not only concern old age insurance, since a widower's pension was also introduced.\nDespite a recognized need for reform, the legal bases of the OASI have not been adapted since 1997. Several projects as well as popular initiatives have failed before the people, the last time on September 24, 2017, date of rejection of the 2020 Old Age Insurance reform, which provided for adaptations to both the OASI and occupational pensions. Preparatory work for a new reform of old age provision is underway. The retirement age for men has remained 65, unchanged since 1948. That for women, on the other hand, has been modified several times; originally, it was also set at 65 years, but a couple's pension was paid from the moment the man was 65 and his wife 60. The retirement age for women was lowered to 63 in 1957, and to 62 years in 1964. In 1979, the threshold age giving entitlement to a couple's pension was raised for women to 62 years as part of the consolidation plan provided for by the 9th revision of the AVS. The 10th revision raised the retirement age for women in two stages to 63 (in 2001), then to 64 (in 2005) . It also made possible the early receipt of an annuity.\nIn the second version of the draft 11th revision of the OASI, the Federal Council proposed to Parliament to increase the retirement age for women to 65 and to encourage early retirement for people of modest means through financial support. Parliament rejected this revision in October 2010. The theme of retirement age was taken up during the 2020 Old Age Insurance reform, which planned to set the reference age at 65 for both women and men, with the time of retirement being freely variable. chosen between 62 and 70 years old.\nContributions levied on salaries to finance the OASI increased from 4 to 8.4% between 1969 and 1975. As for contributions from the self-employed, they increased from 4.6 to 7.8% between 1969 and 1979. Since then, contribution rates remained unchanged. The Confederation's contribution has gradually increased and since 2008 has amounted to 19.55% of insurance expenditure. VAT was increased by one point in 1999, the amount thus collected being allocated to OASI.\n\n\n== Services ==\nThe OASI grants old age pensions, widow's and widower's pensions. Since January 1, 1997, husband and wife now each receive their pension. This is set according to the duration of contributions of each spouse and their income, in application of splitting . This means that half of the income obtained during the marriage by both the husband and the wife is recorded in the account of the other spouse. Added to this are bonuses for educational tasks or assistance tasks assigned to family members who look after children or take care of impotent parents.\nFor a full contribution period (scale 44), the amount of the AVS pension, in 2018, is a minimum of 1,175 Swiss francs per month, and that of the maximum pension, 2,350 Swiss francs per month. The maximum amount - two pensions - for a couple, on the other hand, is 3,525 Swiss francs.\nThe Federal Department of Finance has made available a pension calculator (ESCAL) for people who are wondering about the future pension they will receive upon retirement, on their website. This website complements the compensation funds which can provide information on retirement-related issues at any time, regardless of the age of the applicant. However, these estimates on this website are based on hypothetical elements, the calculations of which imply that the amounts announced are indicative. The amounts indicated therefore have no legal value and do not bind the Swiss Compensation Fund. To know precisely the pension that a retiree will receive, the future retiree will have to wait until he has almost reached retirement age, and until he has provided all the necessary documents to his compensation fund so that it can calculate your future pension.\n\n\n== Opening of the right to a pension ==\nThe right to a pension begins on the 1st day of the month following the month in which the insured person reached retirement age. People must register with the compensation funds to be entitled to their pension. This request must nevertheless be made several months in advance, to allow the pension to be calculated.\n\n\n=== Retirement age (reference age) ===\nFor men, the retirement age is 65.\nThe retirement age for women increases from 63 in 2001 to 64 in 2005 . It will be raised from 64 to 65 years in four stages. With the reform coming into force on January 1 , 2024, the reference age of women will increase for the first time by three months on January 1, 2025. This first stage will concern women born in 1961. The following stages will concern reference age at 64 years and six months for women born in 1962, then at 64 years and nine months for those born in 1963 and finally at 65 years for those born in 1964. From the start of 2028, the reference age will therefore be 65 years for all insured persons. The step-by-step increase in the reference age applies by analogy to occupational pensions.\n\nTwo compensation measures for women of the transitional generation (from 1961 to 1969) are planned. The first is a lifetime supplement. Women of the transitional generation who decide not to bring forward their retirement pension will receive a monthly OASI pension supplement for life, which corresponds to the percentage of a basic supplement. The second measure is preferential rates in case of anticipation of the annuity. Women belonging to the transitional generation will have the possibility of retiring from the age of 62. In this case, women with low income levels will benefit from more favorable reduction rates than those with higher incomes.\nThis increase in the retirement age for women follows the vote of September 25, 2022. The people and the cantons accepted the OASI reform 21. As for men, retirement will be made more flexible and VAT will increase slightly.\n\nAfter the successive failures of pension reform – eleventh revision 2004 then in 2010, eleventh revision bis (2010), project to reduce the conversion rate of the second pillar in 2010 and “Old age provision 2020” in 2017 –, Federal Councilor Alain Berset presents another project, entitled “AVS 21”. The project is accepted by the two federal chambers - National Council and Council of States, the latter approving the principle of a retirement age of 65 by 31 votes against 13 in March 2021 -, but is the subject of a request for referendum, filed on March 25, 2022.\nAn initiative filed on July 18, 2021by the young PLR with 107,000 signatures proposes at the same time to raise the retirement age to improve the financing of the OASI, by harmonizing the retirement ages of men and women at 66 years. Entitled “For secure and lasting old age provision”, the initiative was criticized by the youth sections of the PBD, PDC, PEV, PVL and UDC parties, who considered that it called into question an old agreement.\nOn September 18, 2021, demonstrations are organized across the country by Swiss trade union organizations. Feminist associations and the USS highlight the current inequalities in the retirement system, with women receiving 37% less on average than men. The demonstration brought together 15,000 people in Bern.\n\n\n=== Flexible retirement age ===\nAll insured persons can, if they wish, receive their pension before the ordinary retirement age. In return, a reduction in their pension is applied. Advance payment can be requested for a maximum of one or two years. It is also possible to postpone the pension for people who wish to continue professional activity beyond the ordinary retirement age.\n\n\n== Evolution of the OASI ==\n\nIn 2017, the Swiss Socialist Party proposed to parliament the creation of a sovereign fund which would supply the old-age and survivors insurance pension fund.\nThe USS and the Green and Socialist parties denounce the financing of retirement falling to women, and the USS has proposed an initiative for a 13th OASI pension (based on the 13th salary model). During the federal votes of March 2024 , the initiative was accepted by a double majority (of the people and the cantons).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nWikiwix (n.d.). \"Admin.ch - Droit fédéral\".\nHumbelin, Oliver; Farys, Rudolf; Jann, Ben; Lehmann, Olivier (2021). \"La redistribution par les impôts et transferts sociaux en Suisse\".

        "content": "Imayama Site (今山遺跡, Imayama iseki) is an archeological site with the ruins of a Yayoi period stone tool production site located in the Yokohama neighborhood of Nishi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. It was designated as a National Historic Site in 1993, with the area under protection expanded in 2003.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Imayama Site is located on a small hill at an elevation of 82 meters, located in the northwestern part of Fukuoka City, on the Itoshima Plain on the Hakata Bay coast. Originally, this hill was about 500 meters north-to-south and 300 meters east-to-west, but the northern half has been leveled and is now a residential area.  The site was discovered in 1923 by a professor at Kyushu Imperial University, and as a result of several subsequent archaeological excavations, was found to contain ruins over a wide area, including near the basalt outcrop at the summit, the mid-slopes on the south and southeast sides, and at the foot of the mountain. A large amount of basalt fragments, including lithic flakes from the lithic reduction process of making stone axes, were found mixed with unfinished stone axes and hammerstones. In addition, many unfinished stone axes that were damaged during the production process were unearthed on the gentle slope at the foot of the mountain at an elevation of around five meters. A thick clam-blade stone ax that was around 8 by 20 centimeters with a thickness of 5 centimeters and weight of 1.5 to 2 kilograms was found, and is thought to have been designed for cutting down trees. The production of these stone axes began at the beginning of the Yayoi period, but the number increased dramatically in the middle of the Yayoi period.  Stone axes from this site have been found distributed over a wide area of northern Kyushu.\nOther artifacts found in stratification layers included Jōmon pottery from the early and middle Jōmon periods, bronze swords from the Yayoi period, and salt-making earthenware from the early Kofun period.  The site is approximately a 17-minute walk from Kyūdai-Gakkentoshi Station on the JR Kyushu Chikuhi Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFukuoka city home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "Gail Dahms (born June 27, 1957) is a former Canadian actress and singer, most noted as a Juno Award nominee for Most Promising Female Vocalist at the Juno Awards of 1977.\nOriginally from Kitchener, Ontario, she had musical theatre roles in various local theatre productions, including South Pacific, Annie Get Your Gun, Guys and Dolls and Fiddler on the Roof, in her teenage years. She was signed to a recording contract soon after finishing high school, and recorded a number of singles in 1975 and 1976, including \"Can't We Somehow\", \"Rescue Me\" and \"This Song Reminds Me of You\". However, she became best known in this era as the star of a series of television commercials for Turtles candy, playing a sexy Marilyn Monroe-style character who sang the jingle \"Ooooh, I love Turtles\" to a pair of turtle mascots.\nShe did not release any further music as a recording artist, but continued to have acting roles, including the musical Eight to the Bar, the stage play The Guys in the Truck, a regular role as a nightclub singer in the television series Flappers, and supporting roles in the films The Silent Partner, Stone Cold Dead and The Man in 5A.\nIn 1983 and 1984 she appeared in a production of Sugar Babies, first in Toronto, and subsequently on Broadway and in Boston. After concluding her run in that show she announced that she was moving to the United States to pursue work in Hollywood. \nShe subsequently married American musician Jon Bonine, but chose to pursue family life rather than continuing her career. She had a behind-the-scenes credit as a voice coach on the 1994 children's film The Little Rascals, but after the 1994 Northridge earthquake she and Bonine moved to Boise, Idaho, where she worked in music ministry for her church and performed in Bonine's swing jazz ensemble.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGail Dahms at IMDb",

He is most known for leading the 2024 Columbia University pro-Palestinian campus occupation as a spokesperson for Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJames spent most of his childhood in Dorchester. After his mother died when he was 12, he was raised by an aunt where he lived with two cousins. He identifies as \"a first-generation African-Caribbean gay Black male.\"\nHe attended Dever Elementary, UP Academy Boston, and Boston Latin Academy. While a high school student, he said that \"the ultimate destination is Congress.\"\n\n\n== Boston Public Schools ==\nWhile a student at Boston Latin Academy,  James was elected by his peers to be a non-voting member of the Boston School Committee. He served from the fall of 2020 to March 2021. He then resigned, saying that the district was trying to disrespectfully silence him and was using \"adultist rhetoric.\" He also resigned from the District Student Advisory Council. In June 2021, he attended a virtual meeting of the School Committee where he ended his remarks by saying \"I, too, hate white people.\"\nJames was also vice president of Latin Academy's Black Student Union and captain of the school dance team.\n\n\n== Columbia University ==\nJames matriculated at Columbia University in the fall of 2021. He majored in economics and political science. James was a leader of the Gaza Solidarity Encampment on campus in April 2024.\nAs a student, James posted on social media that \"Zionists in my DM wanting to meet up and fight. I don’t fight to injure or for there to be a winner or a loser, I fight to kill.\" University officials called him into a disciplinary meeting in January 2024 to discuss the post, and James recorded it. \nAt that meeting he made a number of incendiary comments, including \"Zionists don’t deserve to live\" and \"Be grateful that I’m not just going out and murdering Zionists.\" When an administrator asked \"Do you see why that is problematic in any way?\" James responded with \"No.\" He added that Zionists were like Nazis and said \"I feel very comfortable, very comfortable, calling for those people to die.\"\nJoe Biden's administration condemned the remarks. James apologized when the remarks were made public in April 2024. James said on X: \"I affirm the sanctity of all life and the movement for liberation.\"\nColumbia then banned him from the campus, saying that \"calls of violence and statements targeted at individuals based on their religious, ethnic or national identity are unacceptable and violate university policy.\" The university would not comment on his status as a student.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The King David Hotel (Hebrew: מלון המלך דוד) is a proposed hotel in Paradise, Nevada intended to cater to Jewish travelers.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2023, plans were submitted to Clark County seeking approval for the project. The Clark County Zoning Commission will need to review the proposal.\nThe hotel will be located west of the Las Vegas Strip at 3601 Vegas Plaza Drive between Spring Mountain Road and Flamingo Road. It will be west of Treasure Island, north of The Mirage and south of the Fashion Show Mall.\nJewish leaders had been calling for a synagogue and a hub for Jewish travelers near the Las Vegas Strip for years. The nearest synagogue is Chabad of Southern Nevada, which is four miles from the Las Vegas Strip. Having a synagogue close to the Las Vegas Strip will be convenient for observant Jews who must walk on the sabbath. In addition, there are not many kosher food options around the Las Vegas Strip. It is hoped that the hotel would make the Las Vegas Valley a year-round destination for Jewish tourism. The structure's design would be similar to that of the Citigroup Center in New York City.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe hotel will contain 486 guest rooms and will be 46 stories tall. It will have feature that cater to Jewish travelers. It will include a synagogue as well as banquet space. The hotel will contain bars as well as restaurants that serve kosher food. Retail and convention space will also be included. \n\n\n== See also ==\nKing David Hotel\nList of tallest buildings in Las Vegas\n Hotels portal\n\n\n== External links ==\nKing David Hotel Las Vegas Official Website \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Bryan Farrer (25 November 1858 - 23 April 1944) was an association football right-sided forward who played in the 1881 FA Cup final for the Old Etonians.\n\n\n== Family and early life ==\nFarrer was the third son of Oliver Farrer, of Binnegar Hall, Wareham, Dorset, and went up to Eton College in 1871; one of those admitted at the same time was Cecil Spring-Rice.

The second was the 2–1 win at Stafford Road which put the Etonians into the final, against the Old Carthusians, and he retained his place for the game at half-back, but was anonymous in a 3–0 defeat.\nFarrer's next appearance in the competition was for the Clapham Rovers in the 1882–83 edition, once more against the Old Carthusians, due to a reshuffle that saw regular half-back Bailey put into the forward line, but he was again on the losing side, this time 5–3\nHe remained with the Rovers until 1885, and then reverted to the Old Etonians, his final recorded match being a 3–0 defeat to the Old Westminsters in the 1886–87 FA Cup third round.\n\n\n== Professional life ==\nFarrer married Mabel Gertrude Smith in South Kensington in December 1892; the couple had three sons.  He was called to the Bar in 1884, and became a bencher at Lincoln's Inn. He qualified as a county magistrate in 1924, sitting at Wareham, and was also chairman of the Juvenile Court.\nHe served as a councillor on the Dorset County Council, for the Wareham Division, from 1928 to 1939, when he stepped down due to ill-health.  He was also a member of the Wareham and Purbeck Rural District Council from 1927 to 1941, latterly being vice-chairman. He died at his home at Binnegar Hall.

        "content": "Günter Sieber (11 March 1930 – 26 November 2006) was a German politician, diplomat and party functionary of the Socialist Unity Party (SED).\nIn the German Democratic Republic, he served as Trade and Supply Minister, ambassador to Poland and, most notably, as the longtime head of the International Relations Department of the Central Committee of the SED. During the Wende, he also briefly served in the Politburo of the Central Committee of the SED as a candidate member.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nSieber worked as a forest worker until 1947 and as a forestry assistant until 1948 in Ilmenau. He also became a member and functionary of the FDGB (Free German Trade Union Federation), after which he became a principal clerk in the German Economic Commission.\nIn 1948, he joined the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) and attended a study program at the Academy for Political Science and Law of the GDR in Potsdam from 1949 to 1950. From 1949 to 1951, he served as a consultant in the Ministry of Planning and until 1952 as a chief consultant in its successor, the State Planning Commission.\n\nAfter studying at the \"Karl Marx\" Party Academy, he served as First Secretary of the SED in the State Planning Commission until 1962, Deputy Chairman of the Central Commission for State Control at the Council of Ministers until 1963, and inaugural First Deputy Chairman of the Workers' and Farmers' Inspection Committee until 1965. Additionally, he was a member of the Central Auditing Commission (German: Zentrale Revisionskommission) (ZRK) of the SED from 1963 to 1967.\nFollowing distance learning at the SED's Central Institute for Socialist Economic Management, Sieber served as Minister for Trade and Supply from March 1965 to November 1972, succeeding Gerhard Lucht, and as Ambassador of the GDR to the Polish People's Republic from 1973 to 1980. During his diplomatic tenure, he was elected to the Central Committee of the SED as a candidate member.\n\n\n=== SED Central Committee ===\nHaving been elected as a candidate member in May 1976 (IX. Party Congress), Sieber rose to become a full member of the Central Committee of the SED in April 1981 (X. Party Congress), serving until its collective resignation in December 1989. He additionally became member of the Volkskammer in 1981, nominally representing a constituency in southern Bezirk Magdeburg.\nIn December 1980, he was made head of the Department for International Relations of the Central Committee, succeeding Egon Winkelmann, who became Ambassador to the Soviet Union. The International Relations Department was responsible for preparing Politburo decisions that concerned foreign policy issues and to control their implementation. As head, Sieber met foreign leaders, especially leaders of other communist parties and national liberation movements such as SWAPO president Sam Nujoma.\nIn 1964, Sieber was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in Silver, in 1979 in Gold, and in 1988, the Banner of Labor.\n\n\n=== Peaceful Revolution ===\nDuring the Wende, on 8 November 1989, Sieber was elected to the Politburo of the Central Committee of the SED, the de facto highest leadership body in East Germany, as a candidate member and to the Central Committee Secretariat as Secretary responsible for International Politics and Economics.\nSieber's career advancement would prove to be short-lived, as the SED quickly lost power. At its last session on 3 December 1989, the Central Committee elected Sieber to a commission tasked with analyzing the causes of the crisis in the SED and in society\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gorjok Gak (born 9 November 1996) is an Australian professional basketball player for the Rockingham Flames of the NBL1 West. He is also contracted with the Tasmania JackJumpers of the National Basketball League (NBL). He played college basketball for the Florida Gators and California Baptist Lancers before starting his professional career in the Czech Republic, where he won a championship with Basketball Nymburk. He debuted in the NBL in 2022 and has played for the Brisbane Bullets and South East Melbourne Phoenix.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGak was born in Egypt to South Sudanese refugees, but his family soon decided to leave the country and move to Sydney, New South Wales. He began playing basketball in Sydney and participated in the annual South Sudanese Australian National Classic. He attended St Augustine's College before moving to the United States in 2014. His friend, Deng Adel, convinced him to play high school basketball at Victory Rock Prep in Bradenton, Florida.\nGak graduated from Victory Rock Prep in 2016 and averaged 13.9 points and 9.3 rebounds in his final season. He helped Victory Rock Prep to a championship in the team's season-ending Grind Session National Tournament.\n\n\n== College career ==\nGak committed to Oklahoma State to play for Travis Ford, but he was released from his letter-of-intent after Ford was fired at the end of the 2015–16 season. Gak subsequently joined the Florida Gators in April 2016.\nGak was initially ruled ineligible by the NCAA at the beginning of his rookie season, due to questions about the number of games he played at Victory Rock Prep. His eligibility was restored in full following an appeal. As a freshman for Florida in 2016–17, Gak saw limited minutes and totaled 23 points and 23 rebounds in 15 appearances.\nAs a sophomore in 2017–18, Gak battled through knee soreness and swelling all season and averaged 2.2 points and 2.4 rebounds in 29 games.\nFollowing off-season knee surgery, Gak redshirted the 2018–19 season. He returned to the Gators for the 2019–20 season but suffered a dislocated shoulder in a practice in October. He appeared in two games while battling various injuries before leaving the team at the end of December.\nIn April 2020, Gak joined the California Baptist Lancers as a graduate transfer. In the 2020–21 season, Gak played and started in all 23 games and averaged 13.5 points and 10.3 rebounds per game. He scored in double figures 19 times and recorded 10 double-doubles. He scored a career-high 26 points against Long Beach State on 23 January 2021. He was subsequently named All-WAC Second Team, WAC All-Defensive Team and WAC All-Newcomer Team.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nIn July 2021, Gak signed with Basketball Nymburk of the Czech NBL for the 2021–22 season. He helped the team win the Czech League championship and averaged 13.5 points, 10.1 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.7 blocks per game.\nOn 6 July 2022, Gak signed with the Brisbane Bullets of the National Basketball League (NBL) for the 2022–23 season. In round 13 against Melbourne United, he recorded 18 points, 13 rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block. In 25 games, he averaged 4.6 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game.\nGak joined the Willetton Tigers of the NBL1 West for the 2023 season. He earned All-NBL1 West First Team honours and was named the league's Defensive Player of the Year. In 22 games, he averaged 20.1 points, 12.2 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game.\nOn 10 April 2023, Gak signed with the South East Melbourne Phoenix for the 2023–24 NBL season. He endured an injury-hit season, playing just 17 games and averaging 5.4 points and 4.9 rebounds per game.\nGak joined the Rockingham Flames for the 2024 NBL1 West season.\nOn 18 April 2024, Gak signed a two-year deal with the Tasmania JackJumpers, with the second year containing a club option.\n\n\n== National team ==\nGak played for the Australian University National Team in 2017 at the World University Games in Taipei. In eight games, he averaged 11.1 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGak is the son of Ajok Langar and Matur Gak and his siblings are Deng, Nyapath, Akoldah, Adeng and Ayen. Two of his brothers, Deng and Akoldah, are also professional basketball players. His uncle, Longar Longar, played basketball at Oklahoma and his aunt, Nytar Longar, played basketball at Buffalo.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNBL profile\nNBL1 profile\nFlorida Gators college bio\nCalifornia Baptist Lancers college bio",

        "content": "The written history of Aubing begins with a document from the year 1010, but archaeological traces in the area of today's Munich district of Aubing go back further and suggest a continuous settlement since pre-Roman times. A terraced burial ground from the 5th to 7th century is of supra-regional importance.\nIn the aforementioned document dated April 16, 1010, King Henry II grants the Polling Abbey the ownership rights to Aubing. However, according to the documents, Aubing probably remained part of the Bavarian ducal estate, as Ludwig the Bavarian donated Aubing to Ettal Abbey in 1330 as part of the founding endowment. The Ettal rule lasted for almost 500 years until the process of secularization in Bavaria. When the independent municipality was formed in 1818, the former Hofmark Freiham was assigned to Aubing for the first time. The railroad connection in the second half of the 19th century marked the start of a period of strong population growth, which is continuing. Since the beginning of the 20th century, new districts have been established, including Neuaubing, Aubing-Ost, Am Westkreuz, and Freiham in the 21st century.\nFor centuries, Aubing was the most populous village west of Munich. The parish of Aubing included the neighboring villages to the east, from Allach to Laim. In neighboring Pasing, however, the population grew even faster after the construction of the railroad, so that it surpassed Aubing at the end of the 19th century. In 1942, Aubing was incorporated into Munich and constituted a borough in its own right until it was absorbed into the borough of Aubing-Lochhausen-Langwied in 1992.\n\n\n== Archaeological finds ==\nThe earliest evidence of human habitation in the Aubing Gemarkung was discovered in 1995/1996, situated to the south of Bodenseestraße (Bundesstraße 2) within the Freiham development area. The single-body burial uncovered at that time, dating to the late Neolithic period, included grave goods such as Corded Ware vessels, which were dated to a period between approximately 2900 and 2300 BC. Additionally, approximately 40 house foundations could be reconstructed based on postholes, including some from the Early Bronze Age. Subsequently, burial finds of the early Urnfield Culture were discovered, as they also came to light in the wider area, for example in 2005 in a well under the Aubinger Weg in the form of a clay temple. The archaeological findings indicate a cessation in the settlement history for the subsequent centuries, which only resumes in the Moosschwaige region west of Neuaubing with burial finds from the considerably younger Hallstatt period. In 2009, a pre-Roman foundation and three additional, presumably Roman building remains were discovered to the north of Bodenseestraße. The discovery of further Roman artifacts and the remains of the Bronze Age and later Iron Age in the local area indicates that the Aubing area was continuously inhabited from an early period.\nIn 2010, findings from the Corded Ware period were also unearthed to the north of Bodenseestraße, east of Freihamer Weg, during pre-construction investigations conducted by the State Office for the Preservation of Monuments. A stool burial of an adult male in a supine position with bent arms and legs was discovered in a circular ditch measuring six and a half meters in diameter. The grave goods included an axe made of amphibolite, an axe made of gneiss, a dagger made of flint, and the remains of a ceramic vessel.\n\nThe origins of the village of Aubing can be traced back to the 5th century AD. Approximately one-kilometer northeast of the town center, on the current edge of the development north of Bergsonstraße, there was a grave field from the 5th to 7th centuries with 862 graves in which 881 individuals were interred. The site was discovered and partially excavated in 1938 but was subsequently removed during subsequent archaeological investigations between 1961 and 1963. The excavated objects are now in the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection. The cemetery is of historical significance because it is one of the largest in Bavaria from the period of upheaval between the end of Roman rule and the first recorded mentions of the Baiuvarii. The numerous grave goods, which can be dated to approximately 40 years ago, provide a highly detailed insight into the way of life at the time. These include two bronze finger rings with Christian symbols, the oldest evidence of Christianity in the diocese of Munich-Freising, which occurred 200 years before the time of St. Corbinian. In women's graves, the most frequently found objects are colorful glass beads from necklaces or robe decorations. In the case of wealthy women, these graves also include brooches. Men's graves from the 6th century AD included swords and other weapons. From the middle of the 7th century, the number of grave goods decreased significantly. The number of burials suggests that the cemetery was used by several farms. These structures were likely situated in the vicinity of the present-day village center, in proximity to the church of St. Quirin. However, the buildings were constructed from wood and other perishable materials, and thus no traces have survived in Aubing.\n\tEarly medieval grave goods from Aubing\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nA motte-and-bailey castle in the Aubinger Lohe, the foundations of which have been partially preserved, was probably built in the 10th/11th century and abandoned in the 14th century. The current name \"Teufelsburg\" (Devil's Castle) is not historically documented for the period of use, and its origin is unclear. In addition to the obvious possibility of the devil, a derivation from \"Tuifel\" (depression, pond) is also a possible interpretation, as a reference to the damp area of the Dachauer Moos below. It may have served as a refuge for the people of Aubing and to protect the road passing by. In the nineteenth century, the tuff foundations were transferred to a master bricklayer from Aubing, who was remunerated with an annual fee of 45 Kreuzer for their exploitation.\n\n\n== 1010–1330 ==\n\n\n=== First documented mention ===\n\nThe oldest surviving documented mention of Ubingun is a deed from King Henry II dated April 16, 1010, which was sealed in the Reich Chancellery in Regensburg. The etymology of the name Ubingun and thus the derived Aubing is uncertain; there is no evidence to support the assumption that it is derived from the Bavarian male name Ubo.\nThis document indicates that Henry returned to Polling Abbey property in eight villages that, according to the document, \"apparently\" belonged to the abbey in the past. This may be a reference to an expropriation of the abbey by the former Bavarian Duke Arnulf I to finance his army during the Hungarian invasions. In addition to Aubing, the restitution affected the villages of Polling, Weilheim, Rieden, Landstetten, Aschering and Wangen, all situated to the west and north of Lake Starnberg, as well as a Pfaffenhofen, presumably Oberpfaffenhofen. The Aubing tithe, which was to be paid to the abbey, is also mentioned. The document, measuring 46 cm by 58 cm, is written in Latin and diplomatic minuscule script. It can be found in the Bavarian Main State Archives, with the inventory designation BayHStA Kl. Polling Urk. 1.\nThe transfer of land in Aubing to Polling Abbey, as described in the document, is open to question as to whether it was more than a declaration of intent. The details are vague, and no reference is made to specific buildings or lists of properties, as was done in comparable cases of retransfer. In 1136, Polling Abbey received confirmation from Pope Innocent II of its claims to Aubing, as evidenced by the document of 1010. This act was interpreted as a warning to the secular ruler to finally fulfill these claims. However, likely, the property that Polling Abbey had been deprived of by Arnulf remained in the treasury of the Duchy of Bavaria. The tithe from Aubing to Polling Abbey is documented in the following centuries. However, the transportation costs to the nearest collection point, the toe box in Aschering, were likely to exceed the value of the goods. Finally, in the 18th century, Polling Abbey sold the rights to the Aubing tithe to a Munich merchant.\nBy 1500, approximately 200 additional documents had been discovered in which Aubing or Aubinger were mentioned. The earliest known Aubinger was Engilmar(us) de Ubingen. He was a ministerial servant at the Benediktbeuern Abbey and provided testimony regarding a foundation based there, which can be traced between 1062 and 1090. This indicates that Benediktbeuern owned land in Aubing, as Engilmarus would have been obliged to perform this service. Other servants with the name \"von Aubing\" are documented for the monasteries of Beuern, Neustift, Schäftlarn, and Weihenstephan. Heinrich von Aubing (Heinricus de Ubingen), mentioned between 1155 and 1174, was politically influential as a ministerialis and retainer of Duke Henry the Lion.\n\n\n=== 1180-1330: Wittelsbach ducal estate ===\nIn 1180, the year of the transfer of power in the Duchy of Bavaria from the Welf Henry the Lion to the Wittelsbach Otto I, the knight Otto von Aubing (Otto miles de Ubingen) emerged as the first Wittelsbach ministerial. He attested to a donation from \"his lord,\" the Wittelsbach Count Palatine Frederick II, to Polling Abbey. This leads to the conclusion that the ducal possessions in Aubing also fell to the Wittelsbachs along with the duchy. It is not known whether there were other landlords in Aubing besides the duke and the local church, nor whether Ritter Otto was related to earlier von Aubing knights.\nTo obtain an overview of their estates, the Wittelsbach dukes had their chancellery in Landshut draw up Urbarium, lists of the property and rights of the duchy, which had evidential value, similar to today's land registrations. The first of these Urbarium, produced between 1227 and 1237, provides insight into the state of Aubing at that time. In this document, Aubing is first assigned to the \"Ampt ze Dachowe,\" the later district court of Dachau. Prior to the separation of jurisdiction and administration in the 19th century, the courts were also responsible for administration. Of the 62 \"whole farms\" belonging to the duchy in this office, 19, or almost a third, were located in Aubing. The next largest villages had only five such farms. Although the Urbar does not mention farms belonging to other landlords, this suggests that Aubing was already an above-average-sized village at the time. The farms were not described in detail, but the annual taxes were recorded precisely. These amounted to 18 pigs, 30 geese, 90 chickens, 1,500 eggs, as well as grain, turnips, and peas for the 19 farms, the amount of which is given in \"Mutt des Herzogs,\" a unit of volume, the size of which is no longer known. It is notable that, in contrast to other villages, no cheese was obtained from Aubing, suggesting that there were not many dairy cattle. Monetary payments were not part of the taxes paid by the farms to the lord of the manor. However, money was required as a tax for a \"tree garden\" and a mill.\nFollowing the initial division of Bavaria, a second urbarium for the Duchy of Upper Bavaria was compiled between 1269 and 1271. The data on Aubing is largely consistent with that presented in the initial urbarium, although the number of farms has increased to 29. In the third ducal charter from the 1340s, it is only noted that the entire village of Aubing, including the entire manor, now belonged to Ettal Abbey.\nThere is evidence of other landlords at the same time as the Wittelsbach dukes. In 1314, a \"Wiesmahd\" from the Altenhohenau Abbey was exchanged for other goods with Dukes Rudolph and Ludwig of Bavaria. According to the registers of 1315, Aubing paid 20 \"scaffas\" of wheat to the diocese of Freising.\n\n\n== 1330-1803: Rule of the Ettal Abbey ==\n\nEmperor Ludwig the Bavarian († October 11, 1347) established the Ettal Abbey in 1330. In order to guarantee the abbey's financial stability, the Abbey was endowed with agricultural estates and the associated landowners. The Latin document indicates that this also included \"Tota villa in Awbingen cum omnibus suis pertinentiis ...,\" which translates to the entire village of Aubing with all its appurtenances. Additionally, the document specifies three farms in Lochhausen, two farms and six Huben in Überacker (which is currently a district of Maisach). In the case of \"Tota villa,\" or the entire village, it is important to note that approximately one-quarter of the Aubing farms were under the ownership of other lords and therefore did not transfer to the Ettal Abbey. For instance, the records of the Heilig-Geist-Spital in Munich indicate that it owned two farms in Aubing in 1390. It retained its ownership of Aubing until 1800. In addition to the aforementioned landowners, the parish of Aubing and various citizens of Munich also held land in the area. These included Orlando di Lasso, the court chapel master of the ducal court, and his heirs, who owned land in Aubing from 1578 to 1617. The tithing rights of Polling Abbey and the religious assignment of the parish of Aubing to the diocese of Freising remained unaffected by the donation to Ettal.\nBefore the nationalization of the Ettal Abbey in 1803, the Benedictine order exercised authority over the land and law. The majority of the people of Aubing were serfs of the abbey. Its rule was relatively benevolent compared to that of the nobility. For instance, it is unclear whether Ettal expelled its peasants from the house in the event of payment difficulties. The Ettal Hofmark also provided financial support for the Aubing school and teachers' salaries regularly. Pupils are documented in Aubing as early as the 15th century, and the name of the first Ludimagister (schoolmaster) is known from 1649. It can be reasonably assumed that a school was held in the sacristan's house from around 1669, with the Benedictines of Ettal likely playing a role in its establishment. This is evidenced by the fact that the first teachers were in the service of the church as sacristan, organist, or choirmaster. Financial support from Ettal for Aubing is documented for 1770, following a major crop failure.\n\n\n=== The Bavarian War (1420-1422) ===\n\nDuring the Bavarian War in August 1422, Louis VII, Duke of the Partial Duchy of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, invaded the Partial Duchy of Bavaria-Munich, which was ruled by his cousins Ernest and William III. The residential city of Munich was well equipped for defense, so Ludwig did not attack directly. However, he wanted to disrupt the city's food supply, so he had the villages of Gauting, Germering, Pasing and Aubing burnt down. It is not known how many lives and houses were destroyed in Aubing. What is certain is that the nave of the church burned down, presumably it was made of wood. Only the stone tower (built after 1270), which has survived to this day, remained standing. In the Battle of Alling, two villages away, the Dukes of Munich finally defeated their cousin Ludwig on September 19, 1422. The new nave of St. Quirin's Church was consecrated in 1489.\n\n\n=== Division of power by Duke Sigismund, 1476 ===\nThe ducal authority in Aubing had been represented by the Dachau district court since the 13th century. Aubing was on the edge of the district court, the neighboring Freiham and Pasing already belonged to the Starnberg district court. The district court was responsible for public order and high jurisdiction. It also controlled the lower courts, in Aubing before the Ettal period a village court belonging to a nobleman. Owning a court was financially attractive due to the fees levied, but taxes also had to be paid to the duke. There is evidence that the village court was now owned by Ettal in 1440. Elsewhere, namely at the Murnau district court, Ettal was also responsible for high jurisdiction. In Aubing, however, there was a dispute between Ettal and the district court over jurisdiction and the associated fees.\nThis dispute was settled in 1476 by a decision of Duke Sigismund. Sigismund had retired from government in favor of his younger brother Albert, lived in nearby Blutenburg Castle and was the lord of Dachau. He defined the responsibilities as follows: Ettal was granted lower jurisdiction over all the people of Aubing, including the serfs of other landlords. Aubing thus became a closed Hofmark of Ettal. The district court retained high jurisdiction, i.e. all proceedings that could end with the death penalty. However, confiscated property of these criminals remained with the lower court if they were arrested in the area of the lower court. The district judge and the Dachau officials were not allowed to enter the Hofmark, and the handover point for criminals was precisely defined. The district court retained sovereign duties such as the mustering of the Aubingers for the ducal army; a preserved list from the 16th-century lists 81 Aubingers fit for military service by name. The supervision of weights and measures was a joint task, and the lower court was responsible for imposing related punishments.\nEttal established a common seat of justice for all properties in the Dachau district court area. Although Aubing was the largest of these estates, it was in a peripheral location, so the judge's seat was moved to the more central Maisach. A copy of the Wittelsbach Code was also kept there. An amtmann of the Hofmark lived in Aubing, who took over the police function and also organized official meetings in the inn, for which the judge came to Aubing. However, not all judges made the journey to Aubing, so the people of Aubing had to walk to Maisach, three hours away.\n\n\n=== Further events of the 15th century ===\nIn 1433, Aubing briefly became the focus of Bavarian state history when the Aubing parish priest and provosts of St. Ulrich's Church in Laim sold two properties in Untermenzing, near Blutenburg Castle, to the \"honorable maiden Agnes Bernauer\". The corresponding document is the first evidence of Bernauerin's first name.\nWhether the plague claimed as many victims in Aubing in the 15th century as elsewhere is not reported in the known sources. The only mention is found in a diary kept by the Aubing priest Michael Gotzmann, who writes that his father died of the plague in 1483.\n\n\n=== Village ordinance around 1530 ===\nAll Aubing farmers were serfs of their respective landlords. The social status and the amount of taxes and duties to be paid depended on the size of the farmed estate. Four village elders were elected as spokesmen for the Gmain, i.e. the community of villagers. Whole farms were the largest farming estates, but there were also half, quarter, and sixth farms. There was also a barber establishment, which offered basic medical care as well as shaves a bath, and a metalsmith. Other professions such as merchants, millers, tailors, or cordwainers are only to be found in Aubing much later or not at all. The inhabitants were therefore largely self-sufficient in this respect.\nLiving together in the Aubing Gmain was governed by fixed rules. The Ettal court magistrate Ulrich Steger, a lawyer trained at the University of Ingolstadt, recorded these rules in writing in 1530 in a code of conduct. This was therefore not a new introduction, but a description of what was considered binding. These rules contained five sections. The land regulations regulated how the agricultural land and groves belonging to the Gmain, the commons, were to be used and maintained. For example, a full-time farmer was entitled to more meadow cutting than a quarter-farm farmer. Fines were imposed for violations. The second part described the farmers' obligation to keep field fences to prevent game from entering the fields. After collecting the tithe, farmers were allowed to drive their livestock onto the harvested fields. The felling of fruit-bearing trees was forbidden on pain of a fine. The third part regulated which tradesmen were employed by the municipality. These included the barber and the blacksmith. The former received payments from the adult men, and the latter received a fixed amount of natural resources from each farmer each year and did some work for free in return. The fourth part regulated the payment of service providers who only worked in certain seasons. These included the field keeper, the keeper of the communal herd, the herdsman for breeding cattle, and the watchman. The last part regulated the catering of the judge in the tavern. The fines to be paid were to be used for this first. If these were insufficient, the villagers had to help out.\n\n\n=== The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) ===\nAubing experienced extensive devastation during the Thirty Years' War. Initially, the war's impact on daily life was minimal, as hostilities primarily occurred in other regions of Germany. In 1629, several individuals from Aubing were confirmed in Dachau by the Prince-Bishop of Freising, Veit Adam von Gepeckh. In May 1632, the army of the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf stood outside Munich. He had promised Munich protection if the city was surrendered without a fight, to which the city agreed. However, the king allowed his soldiers to plunder the surrounding villages in the west on May 17 or 18. There is a report from the parish priest of Lochhausen, north of Aubing, about the loss of money, valuables, livestock, and other items, but he does not mention any fires. There are no eyewitness accounts from Aubing, but a list from the Ettal Abbey from 1637 and a tax book from the Dachau district court from 1670 indicate that at least 19 farms were destroyed by fire. Historians assume the fire affected at least 40 of the 80 existing properties.\nThe village of Brunham, situated between Lochham and Pasing, was last referenced in connection with the events of 1632. It is likely that the village burned down and was subsequently abandoned. The Brunham road from Aubing to Lochham serves as a reminder of the former village. Between the fall of 1632 and 1634, imperial troops passed through the area on several occasions, and their soldiers were also responsible for stealing food.\nIn 1646, the Swedish army once again traversed the region. As with the initial incursion, numerous inhabitants of Aubing sought refuge in Munich. The records of the parish of St. Peter indicate that one marriage and ten baptisms were conducted for individuals hailing from Aubing. Some sources suggest that, in contrast to other locales, Aubing experienced less devastation during the second Swedish invasion than during the initial incursion.\nThe \"Leibgeldregister\" of the district court of Dachau, a register of households liable to pay taxes, still lists 44 Aubing names in 1640, only half as many as in 1619. In 1649, there are still 30, and in 1657, 41. It is uncertain whether the households that were no longer listed were no longer extant or were omitted due to wartime poverty. A considerable number of the inhabitants of Aubing were no longer mentioned after 1632, and several Aubing family names are no longer traceable after the Thirty Years' War. Ettal directories often state that \"the whole farm was burned and everything died.\" However, new names also appear. In one instance, it is documented that the newcomer hailed from Tyrol. At this time, the landlords of the Aubing farmers were not solely the Ettal Abbey; they also included the Munich parishes of Heilig Geist and St. Peter, as well as some Munich citizens. Following the war, they attempted to enhance agriculture by rebuilding residential and farm buildings. Nevertheless, it was not until several decades later that it was possible to resume farming at the pre-war scale. Consequently, an area to the south of the village, near the current Bodensee road, became overgrown. Until the nineteenth century, there were undeveloped areas in the village, probably caused by burning buildings.\n\n\n=== Wars of the 18th century ===\nThe extent of the damage suffered by Aubing during the wars of 1703/04 in the War of the Spanish Succession and 1741–1745 in the War of the Austrian Succession remains unclear. Only lists from the respective Aubing parish priest have survived, in which forced levies, stolen food, animals and objects as well as a burnt down farm, which was liable to the parish priest, are listed. It cannot be assumed that other Aubing residents fared any better. In 1744, marauding soldiers stabbed a 22-year-old man from Aubing who was on his way to Munich in a wagon.\n\n\n== The Aubing parish from the Middle Ages to the 20th century ==\n\nIn addition to the Ettal Abbey and the Dachau district court, the parish of St. Quirin in Aubing was the third most influential local authority in the Middle Ages and early modern period. This extensive original parish, which belonged to the diocese of Freising, not only included Aubing itself, but also numerous neighboring villages to the east and north. Five branches were mentioned in the Conradine register of the diocese from 1315: The parish of St. Quirin in Aubing was extensive, encompassing not only the village of Aubing itself but also numerous neighboring villages to the east and north. The Conradine register of the diocese from 1315 lists the following villages as belonging to the parish: Pasing, Allach, two Menzings, Laim with cemeteries. The two Menzings are Obermenzing and Untermenzing. The document also records the amount of grain and money that the parish had to pay to the diocese. Later, the following villages were also recorded as belonging to the parish: Blutenburg and Pipping (St. Wolfgang) with their own churches and parts of Friedenheim and Langwied without a church. In contrast, the southwestern Freiham was part of the northern parish of Lochhausen. In 1438, a benefice was established in Pasing, with a separate priest assigned to the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary. This priest continued to belong to the Aubing parish.\nThe earliest known parish priest in Aubing was a \"Chunrad,\" who appears as a witness in documents in 1311 and 1330. St. Quirin was a wealthy parish, which brought the priest corresponding benefices. A Dachau district judge described it as the richest benefice in the district court. The vicarage was alternately assigned by the bishop and the duke. Both took advantage of this to provide for favorites. Consequently, the Aubing priests included canons of Freising and court chaplains of the duke. Some of them were represented by local lieutenant priests while they themselves continued to reside at their lord's court, particularly around 1500. For example, Michael Gotzmann served as vicar (deputy) to Stephan Sundersdorfer, a Freising canon, who documented the financial and personal circumstances of the parish in a register from 1524. In 1525, Gotzmann, born in 1480 as a serf in Aubing, became a parish priest himself. It seems probable that he was the uncle of Georg Gotzmann, who was known as Georgius Theander and held the posts of professor of theology and vice-rector of Ingolstadt University. He was also born in Aubing. The name Theander is derived from the Greek word for \"God's man.\"\nTheander had studied in Vienna and brought back an early mathematical text from there in 1537, which today belongs to the collection of the Austrian National Library as part of the manuscript CVP 5277. Theander, also known as an exegete, was, among other things, ducal commissioner of a commission of the diocese of Freising, who visited the parish of Aubing during the Counter-Reformation in 1560. The surviving report indicates that the entire parish, including its branches, had 850 \"communicants,\" or individuals who received communion (not first communion). This suggests a total population of over 1,000. In addition to the Aubing priest, there was a chaplain in Menzing and two \"Fruemesser,\" or deacons, in Pasing and Aubing. Wolfgang Gotzmann, who may have been a nephew of Michael Gotzmann, served as the parish priest in Aubing from 1581 to 1616. The family name remains in Aubing today, as evidenced by the street name Gotzmannstraße and the adjacent school.\nThe Hofmark of the von Berchem family was situated east of Aubing. It expanded until it encompassed all the Aubing branch villages on the Würm. From 1672, they also owned Blutenburg Castle. In 1686, Pastor Prugg recorded the baptism of two Turkish boys in the \"Baronial Berchem Castle Chapel\" in the baptismal register. The two boys had been brought by \"Your Excellency Baron von Berchem during the siege and capture of the fortress of Neuhäusl in Hungary,\" that is, from the campaign against the Turks. Ali and Osman became Anton and Joseph. In Aubing itself, a Mehmet became Johannes Antonius Turco in the same way in 1690.\n\nA state \"goods conscription\" from 1752 lists 106 properties for Aubing, nine of which were owned by the parish. In addition, there was land ownership in the Allach and Obermenzing branches.\nIn 1817, the parish priest of Aubing, Michael Prumer, observed that the remoteness of the villages necessitated the recruitment of young, sprightly clergymen. In 1914, Josef Steinbacher cites a \"Diocesan description of Westermayer\" presumably from 1874. At least by 1880, the villages belonging to the Aubing parish were listed in a table according to their size. It was also noted that eight Langwied houses belonged to the Lochhausen parish, while five Friedenheim houses with 50 souls still belonged to the Aubing parish. These affiliations remained stable over the centuries.\nThe first significant change occurred in 1880, when Pasing became its parish, with the Laim and Obermenzing branches. In 1914, Allach and Untermenzing were still part of the parish of Aubing, served by an expository priest and an assistant priest. Langwied now belonged entirely to Lochhausen, as Freiham had done since the Middle Ages. The wooden church of St. Joachim and Anna in Neuaubing, consecrated in 1921, became its parish in 1922, now known as St. Konrad.\n\n\n== 1803/18-1942: Independent municipality ==\n\n\n=== Secularization ===\n\nAs part of the secularization in Bavaria initiated by Montgelas, the Ettal land and legal rule over Aubing ended in 1803. Aubing was assigned to the area of the new district court of Munich, the forerunner of the district of Munich. 53% of the land in Aubing passed from ecclesiastical or monastic ownership to state ownership. The rest belonged to Munich citizens and the Starnberg rent office. The Ettal forest property in the Aubinger Lohe also became state property. Living conditions in the Gmain, the village community, changed considerably as a result. The tax burden on the farmers, on the other hand, initially remained the same, except that the taxes now had to be paid to the Electorate of Bavaria. The five guilder allowance that the school teacher had previously received from Ettal Abbey was now also paid by the state. State administrators collected the outstanding money and goods that the farmers still owed the abbey. The \"Aubingian Underthan riots\" chapter was not closed until 1824.\nThe reforms implemented in the newly established Kingdom of Bavaria resulted in the first comprehensive survey of Bavarian municipalities. The so-called original survey, conducted in 1809, revealed that Aubing had 97 properties with a total of 270 buildings.\nFor the years 1801 to 1810, Josef Steinbacher compiled a list of deaths for the entire parish of Aubing from the parish registers. During this ten-year period, he counted 980 births, 612 children who died (62%), and a total of 901 deaths. This indicates that 68% of all deaths were children. A comparison with another source suggests that the term \"children\" in this context refers to individuals up to the age of one. The causes of death in children are cited as smallpox, diarrhea, whooping cough, and \"inadequate assistance during childbirth.\" The most common cause of death in adults was \"Heart failure\".\n\n\n=== Church planting ===\nThe Bavarian municipal edict of 1818 also established the municipality of Aubing, which was governed by a municipal committee elected by all tax-paying citizens, primarily landowners. This committee was headed by an elected head of the municipality. Until 1870, there were seven village heads, all of whom were respected local farmers. A total of ten mayors are recorded between 1870 and the incorporation of the municipality into Munich in 1942.\nWhen Aubing was incorporated, the Hofmark Freiham, which included the Freiham estate and Moosschwaige, also became part of Aubing. However, large areas in the north of the former district no longer belonged to it. In addition to agriculture, the professions of barber, fisherman, metalsmith, butcher, cooper, tailor, weaver, and innkeeper are documented. The first major investment was constructing a school in 1821/22 (today's Alto Street 16, school and sacristan's house until 1894). In addition to elementary education, the parish was responsible for caring for the poor and sick. As a result, a poorhouse was established despite the poor financial situation of the parish. Needy unmarried mothers were also supported. Peat for heating and cleaning and scouring sand from the Aubinger Lohe were delivered to Munich.\n\nFrom 1816 to 1848, the Counts of Yrsch, the owners of the Freiham estate, held the lower jurisdiction.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Aubing in the \"Main report on the cholera epidemic of 1854 in the Kingdom of Bavaria\" ===\nThe cholera epidemic of 1836/37 affected Aubing only to a small extent. During the next epidemic in 1854, however, 68 people died in the Aubing community within three months, 42 of them (39 according to another source) in Aubing itself. This meant that the disease killed about one in twenty people in Aubing. The survivors then vowed to celebrate an annual high mass for the patron saint against epidemics, St. Sebastian.\nIn 1856, the Royal Commission for Scientific Investigations into Indian Cholera published the first part of its main report on the 1854 cholera epidemic in the Kingdom of Bavaria. The death figures in this report (see table) are likely to be incomplete, but they do provide information about the regional spread of the disease. They also show that the disease was particularly severe in Aubing, where the death rate was twice that of Munich.\nFor this reason, commission member Max Pettenkofer personally visited Aubing in June 1856. The main report mentioned above includes a \"presentation\" of his findings. At that time, it was still unclear how cholera spread from person to person and what other factors might have played a role. For example, soil and living conditions were discussed and described in the report. The presentation therefore offers interesting insights beyond the disease itself.\n\nPettenkofer quotes a report by the court physician Dr. Kranz. While Dr. Kranz reported \"many poor\" in other places like Schwabing and Sendling, he wrote about Aubing:\n\nThere are no real poor people in Aubing. Everyone has a decent, nutritious diet and adequate clothing. The entire population is engaged in agriculture and is otherwise a strong tribe of people; apart from spring fever (malaria), there are few other diseases in Aubing.\nAnd at another point:\n\nThe waste rooms in Aubing are in all houses except (outside)' the apartments, 10-20 steps away from the house, at or on the manure places. In the only rectory, the privy is next to the kitchen and the cesspool goes under the house.\nDuring his visit to Aubing, Pettenkofer, with the help of Pastor Gigl, first reconstructed exactly when and where the cholera cases had occurred. He counted 39 deaths in 18 houses and found that all the affected houses were in the northern, lower-lying part of the village, while the southern, higher-lying part remained free of cholera. Examination of the wells belonging to each house revealed that the water table in the wells in the lowest part of the village was about three feet below the surface, while in the higher area it reached over 17 feet. The villagers reported that the cholera year had been very wet and that the well levels were generally several feet higher. Pettenkofer also noted a flow of groundwater from the higher, southern, unaffected part to the affected, lower, northern part.\nPettenkofer discussed the possibility that the risk of infection depended on the amount of public traffic, but rejected this because there were no cases in the house of the local headman, the vicarage, or the inn. He concluded:\n\nAubing is therefore also a clear demonstration that personal contact alone is not sufficient for the development of an epidemic, however necessary it may be, and that other factors must also be involved, one of which is the local situation.\nAlthough he suggested elsewhere in his presentation that the influence of groundwater levels was likely, he did not discuss the possibility of a pathogen being carried in the water.\n\n\n=== Rail connection, Pasing rises ===\n\nFor centuries, Aubing was the main town west of Munich. In 1836 Aubing had 609 inhabitants, Pasing only 411.\nThe railroad played an important role in this development. On September 1, 1839, the first section of the Munich-Augsburg railway line was opened from Munich via Pasing to Lochhausen. Although the line passed through Aubing, the trains did not stop there. Pasing, on the other hand, benefited from the new railroad and its population grew rapidly, reaching 12,090 in 1925. In 1861, Pasing got its first Catholic priest, and in 1881 it became an independent parish with branch churches in Laim and Obermenzing. A Protestant parish was added in 1907. In 1905, Pasing was elevated to the status of a city.\nOn May 1, 1873, the Munich-Buchloe railroad was inaugurated and Aubing received a railroad connection. The line, built along the route of an originally planned canal, passed directly south of the town's buildings at that time; the Aubing station was not far from the parish church of St. Quirin. Aubing was thus easily accessible and the population began to grow, reaching 1700 at the beginning of the 20th century.\nMost of the inhabitants still lived from agriculture. Living in Aubing was cheap compared to the royal residence city of Munich and therefore popular with middle-income earners so that a lot of building land changed hands. The first general practitioner settled in Aubing in 1861, before that the population had been cared for by bathers. From 1901 to 1910, there were a total of 1112 births, 502 deaths (45%) and a total of 626 deaths in the municipality of Aubing. The term \"children\" probably refers to those in their first year of life. During this period, the child death rate fell from over 50% at the beginning to under 40% from 1907. The contemporary chronicler Steinbacher attributed this to \"increased wages\" and the associated more favorable living conditions. \n\n\n=== Industrialization ===\n\n\n==== Chemical factory Aubing ====\nThe Aubing Chemical Factory was probably the oldest industrial settlement in Aubing. In 1894, the Jewish Munich merchant Julius Einhorn acquired the Betzenhaus, a small farm located to the east of Aubing's village center, and built a factory building next to the farm from 1895. The site to the north of the Munich-Buchloe railroad line was given its own railway siding in 1920. In 1905, Einhorn sold the factory to the chemist Moritz Bloch, who continued to expand the business until its Aryanization in 1938 and then emigrated to New York, where he died in 1942. The factory, which specialized in adhesives and pharmaceuticals and had a worldwide distribution network, was run by Bloch's son Kurt from 1949 after the reassignment and then by his executor until 1978, when it was closed. The site was sold to a property developer. Today, only the street names Fabrikstraße and Industriestraße still bear witness to the family business.\n\n\n==== Aubing brickworks ====\nIn 1898, the first Aubing brickworks company was founded to produce bricks from the clay-rich soil south of Aubing station. The clay tongue, which in earlier times had made grain cultivation possible in the first place, was now mined. The \" new Munich brickworks\" acquired an area of 142 acres (about 48 hectares) south of Aubing station. In the same year, the company name was changed, again around 1913, then to \" New Munich Stocks - Brickworks Ltd. in Munich\", as the company's headquarters were in Munich. In 1934, this was moved to Aubing, shortly before the decision to liquidate the company in the same year. After the sale of the company premises, the liquidation of the company was completed in 1942. The buyer initially leased the site, so that production continued after the Second World War until 1962. Although there was still enough clay available, production was no longer profitable.\nThe area to be exploited stretched from Pretzfelder Straße in the north to Wiesentfelser Straße in the south, bordered to the east by the Limesschule and other buildings and to the west by Neideckstraße (both of which are now street names). The brickworks itself was located in the north of this area, southwest of the intersection of Pretzfelder Straße and Streitbergstraße. It included drying barns and kilns as well as a tall chimney. The clay mined with picks and shovels sometimes had to be transported several hundred meters to the site on trolleys. The resulting terrain steps can only be seen today on Streitbergstrasse and Neideckstrasse.\nThe date of the start of production is not known, but it is known that production began in 1901. Municipal records for this year list 50 workers over the age of 16, five between 14 and 16 and three under 14. The number of workers fluctuated greatly, in the following year there were only three, before rising again to 50 to 60. In the years before the First World War, the average number of employees here was therefore higher than at the Aubing chemical factory, which at that time had around 10-20 employees as the South German Ceresin Works Aubing. Most of the workers in the brickworks were probably seasonal workers from the Italian Alps. A letter from the Royal District Office of Munich from 1901 has been preserved, which stipulates minimum standards for their accommodation, from which it can be concluded that the working conditions were poor.\nOperations were suspended during the First World War. After that, only 30 to 40 workers were employed, partly due to some modernization, apart from a temporary shutdown during the global economic crisis in 1932/33. In 1934, a newspaper article described that \"... the wages for about 30 to 50 workers, who for the most part turn over their weekly wages back in Aubing\" were an essential factor for the economic life of the community. In November 1939, the company was shut down again due to a shortage of labor caused by the war. Production was probably resumed in 1948 and continued until 1962.\nThe brickworks was demolished in 1963 and the site is now occupied by residential buildings. However, the building of the company inn \"Zur Lüfte\" in Pretzfelder Straße, which was built in 1903 and still serves as a guesthouse today, has been preserved.\n\n\n==== Central workshop Aubing ====\n\nOn July 3, 1903, the railroad line from Pasing to Herrsching am Ammersee, which ran south of the Aubing area, opened. Even before that, in 1901, the Bavarian state parliament decided to build the \"V. central workshop of the royal Bavarian state railway\", the later railway repair works, south of this line on a site belonging to the Freiham estate. The land was made available at a reasonable price by Hugo Ritter and Edler von Maffei, who had acquired Freiham in 1887. As the owner of the very loss-making Ammersee/Amper shipping company, he had an economic interest in this railroad line. As the railroad had its planning authority, it was not necessary to obtain the consent of the municipality of Aubing.\nThe station (today Neuaubing) was opened in 1905, the Central Workshop Aubing in 1906. The number of employees at this repair works of the Royal Bavarian State Railways grew from 351 in 1906 to over 500 in 1913 and over 1500 after the demobilization of the Bavarian army in 1919. During the First World War, many prisoners of war were deployed. When the Deutsche Reichsbahn was founded, the facilities became known as the Reichsbahn-Neuaubing Repair Works, which was later taken over by the Deutsche Bundesbahn. Alongside Dornier, the large repair plant was the most important local employer for generations and helped shape the culture of life in Aubing in the 20th century. At the end of the 1960s, the railroad was already considering the dissolution of the repair works, but in 1969 those responsible decided to keep it in a reduced form, which would bring economic advantages for the location in the course of modernization and reorganization. After the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1990, the calls for closure and capacity reduction became louder again. From 1997, the plant was assigned to the DB Travel & Tourism transport division as a C plant. Until the beginning of 2001, 530 employees were still working on the repair of passenger coaches; in June of the same year, the management board of Deutsche Bahn AG decided to close the Neuaubing plant by the end of the year.\n\n\n==== Compagnie Internationale des Wagon-Lits et des Grands Express Européens ====\nIn addition to the state-owned repair workshop, a repair workshop of the French International Sleeping and Dining Car Company (Compagnie Internationale des Wagon-Lits et des Grands Express Européens) ISG (CIWL), which later operated under the name ISG and DSG Ltd Neuaubing Workshops, existed in its immediate vicinity from 1913 until December 31, 2000.\nSleeping cars with teak carriages were built in Neuaubing until 1924, when the company switched to all-steel construction. The more than 600 employees also rebuilt and built sleeping and dining cars. The factory closed in 1925 and was temporarily used as a warehouse before the Dornier factory was built (see next chapter). The company Engineering Neuaubing, founded in 1945, again carried out maintenance work on behalf of ISG, and in 1947 the factory once again belonged to ISG. Due to bomb damage, some of the work had to be done outdoors. In 1957, a cooperation with the German Sleeper and Dining Car Company (DSG) was established.\nIn 1966, the refurbishment of DSG dining cars was discontinued as they became the property of the Bundesbahn. The independent DSG operation of sleeping cars also ended in 1974. In 1990, 150 employees were still refurbishing between 380 and 400 cars per year for ISG and cars for TUI-FerienExpress and the Mittelthurgau travel agency. Due to the sharp decline in overnight travel in the following decade, the plant became unprofitable and was closed at the end of 1999.\nMunich hall operator Wolfgang Nöth leased the site in mid-2013.\n\n\n==== Dornier works ====\nIn 1934, an independent company, Dornier-Werke, leased factory facilities from the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which, like the railway workshops, were located south of the Pasing-Herrsching railway line, but immediately east of Brunhamstrasse. In 1935, series production of the Dornier Do 23 aircraft began. The Neuaubing plant was purchased in 1937. The plant was located near Neuaubing and was also referred to as the Neuaubing plant. However, the land east of Brunhamstrasse and south of the railroad tracks belonged to the city of Pasing, even though the Pasing buildings were far away. This area and a strip east of Brunhamstrasse on both sides of Bodenseestrasse later became part of Aubing. In 1938, Dornier employed 2800 people. During the war, the factory produced Junkers Ju 88 and Messerschmitt Me 410 aircraft, using forced labor from 1941 and concentration camp prisoners from 1943. The factory buildings were damaged by bombs and confiscated by the Americans after the fall of Munich.\nAfter 1945, the Allies banned aircraft production, which was resumed in Neuaubing in early 1956 with the successful Dornier Do 27. It was the first German aircraft to be produced in series since 1945. Production of the Do 27 was discontinued in Neuaubing in 1966. In 1958, the factory began work on its successor, the Dornier Do 28. The world's first experimental vertical take-off aircraft, the Dornier Do 31, was built in Neuaubing and in the factory's hangar in Oberpfaffenhofen from 1962. In 1991, the Dornier shareholders' meeting transferred the Neuaubing plant to Deutsche Airbus GmbH. In 1993, shortly before its closure, 1161 employees were still building parts for Airbus. Today, the site of the former factory is home to a business park that rents out commercial space.\n\n\n=== The beginnings of Neuaubing and the founding of further residential areas ===\n\nFor the workers and officials of the Central Workshop, the first housing estate was built on today's Papinstraße, south of the new railroad line and two kilometers from Alt-Aubing, the so-called colony. The new district of Aubing-Süd also grew north of the railroad. However, the name Neuaubing soon caught on and became official in 1915. Since the new citizens from all parts of Bavaria had no taxable home or property, they could not become citizens of the German Empire. It was not until 1919, in the Weimar Republic, that they were allowed to vote. As a state-owned enterprise, the railroad was exempt from municipal taxes. However, the municipality had to provide the necessary infrastructure. As was to be expected, there was friction, for example over the provision of schools.\nThe Munich Railway Building Association (Eisenbahner-Baugenossenschaft München, ebm), founded in 1908, played an important role in the provision of housing. Its housing estate along Limesstrasse south of Plankenfelserstrasse was built in several stages from 1908 until after the Second World War. The transformation from a farming village to a commercial center and the resulting population growth also necessitated a number of public works projects. In addition to the road network, these included a church, a school, and a waterworks with the Aubing water tower, built in 1910 and visible from afar. The necessary expenditures were such a burden on the community that in 1914 the local council applied for incorporation into the financially strong neighboring town of Pasing, which had by then been elevated to the status of a city. However, due to Aubing's poor financial situation, the town council refused.\nNorth of the Munich-Buchloe railroad line, in the far east of Aubing, the new settlement of Aubing-Ost was built in 1909. At the eastern end of today's Aubing-Ost-Straße, the settlement area extended to the north and south. The Free Association Aubing-Ost (since 1956 Settlers' Association Aubing-Ost e. V.), founded in 1913, supported the settlement by buying and selling land and procuring materials. In 1933, 250 residents lived in 50 houses. During the Third Reich, the northeastern part of the settlement was demolished to make way for a new railroad siding. Until the 1970s, the settlement was separated from the rest of the city by fields. With the opening of the Leienfelsstraße station in 1972, the estate was connected to the rapid transit network.\nOnly a few hundred meters north of the railway workers' workshop, a housing estate for the employees of the Dornier factory was built in 1937/38 with about 140 houses. The estate was officially named after the Nazi Minister President Ludwig Siebert, but was also known as the Dornier Estate. The current name is Siedlung am Gößweinsteinplatz. A few years later, during the Second World War, the barracks of the Neuaubing forced labor camp, which still exists today, were built directly west of the Dornier estate. \n\n\n=== Dispute over the Neuaubing school building ===\n\nAs a result of the construction of the central workshop and the resulting population growth, the Munich district office recorded an influx of 100 school-age children as early as 1904. For this reason, the district office repeatedly asked the community of Aubing to build a new school. However, the local authorities were reluctant to do so, arguing that those responsible for establishing the Central Workshop should also finance the necessary infrastructure. The county government accommodated the community financially by providing grants and having a plan drawn up free of charge for the community. Finally, the railroad agreed to contribute as well. In the end, the municipality agreed, but it had to take out loans, which were financed by levies on the taxpaying citizens, i.e., property owners other than the railroad.\nThe Aubing parish priest offered the land to the parish, and the \"Aubing Freiham School\" was opened in 1906. Due to its location between Old Aubing and the new settlement, this led to the two areas growing together in the following years.\nThe school originally offered seven grades. In 1909, the board of the Aubing Youth Welfare Association approached the Royal Government of Upper Bavaria with an urgent request to introduce an eighth year of schooling throughout Aubing. Since boys were not allowed to learn a trade until the age of 14, they would have a year off after school at an age when they \"need the strictest supervision and the most loving guidance,\" but often both parents have to work. Idleness and aimlessness, the cause of misery, were to be avoided by obliging those boys who did not want to work in agriculture, but who wanted to learn a trade, to attend an eighth year of school. In 1910 there were already 120 students. 30 Protestant children went to school in neighboring Pasing. In 1928/29, a first extension doubled the number of classrooms to eight with 321 students.\n\n\n=== A new cemetery ===\nA new Aubing Cemetery was established in 1909 and is still in use today. It is located south of the old village center, on the south side of the railroad line to Buchloe. A contemporary report described the site as \"free on the railroad line from Munich to Bruck, without connection to the village\". In 1909, the site consisted of three dayworks (a good 10,000 m2), two of which were initially fenced off for use. The architect was Adolf Fraaß, who also designed the Neuaubing school building. The above-mentioned contemporary report states:\n\nThe morgue was deliberately designed in friendly shapes and colors; the architect wanted to avoid the usual gloomy coloring for this country cemetery. A simple building, plastered white, with a steep hip roof, the porch supported by four columns, green shutters, and trellis cladding on the side fronts; so the house is sunny rather than sad- which was the intention.\nThe report went on to say that in addition to the inhumation room, the dissection room, and the priest's room, the building also contained a caretaker's apartment. The cost of the building was just under 12,000 marks, and the total cost of the cemetery, including roads and drainage, was about 30,000 marks.\n\tCemetery building and main entrance 1911 and 2020\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The political situation from 1914 onwards ===\nAt the beginning of World War I in 1914, 82 men from Aubing, including fathers with up to eight children, were drafted into the army. 88 Aubing men lost their lives in the war. This was about one-tenth of the adult male population, as there were 874 men eligible to vote in the 1919 municipal elections. The deterioration of the supply situation due to the trade blockades against the German Reich led to the rationing of all raw materials and food in the community. Since many women were working, about 120 children attended the children's home of the Franciscan nuns in Dillingen. The children also received a meal there, made possible by a monthly donation of 250 Reichsmarks from the owner of the Aubing chemical factory, Moritz Bloch. Dr. Bloch later became an honorary citizen of the community. Nevertheless, he had to give up his factory during the Third Reich because he was Jewish (see Aubing Chemical Factory). During the war, 54 Russian prisoners of war from a camp in neighboring Puchheim were used in agriculture.\nAfter the November Revolution of 1918 and the proclamation of the \"Free People's State of Bavaria\" by Kurt Eisner, an 18-member workers' and peasants' council first demanded the resignation of the mayor and the municipal committee in January 1919. This was immediately rejected by the district authorities. After the proclamation of the Bavarian Soviet Republic on April 7, 1919, the municipal committee was again asked to resign under threat of violence. Mayor Josef Widmann had already handed over the administration to the second mayor Jakob Dallmayer in February. Four commissions, consisting of members of the municipal committee and council members, were to take care of various tasks in the municipality. However, according to a protocol dated April 28, the municipal committee was reinstated. Shortly thereafter, on May 1, white troops entered Aubing. On the same day, the local committee passed a resolution demanding the release of three arrested shop stewards.\nThe municipal elections of June 1919 marked the first time that women could vote and be elected; the first woman to be nominated, but not elected, was in 1924. In 1919, out of 1418 eligible voters, including 874 men and 617 women, 1008 cast valid votes (71%) (see table). In the parallel mayoral election, Georg Seeholzer of the Farmers' Association received the most votes (617).\n\nIn the municipal elections on December 7, 1924, only three groups stood for election, a \"civic association\" (9 seats), the SPD (3 seats), and the KPD (2 seats). The mayor was now elected by the city council, Josef Schmidt of the \" Civil Association \" received 8 votes. The last free municipal election in Aubing, on December 8, 1929, was again contested by five groups: The \" Aubing Electoral Community \" (6 seats), the SPD (3 seats), the \" Aubing Economic Bloc \", the \" Aubing Free Association \" (2 seats) and the KPD (1 seat). Josef Schmidt was re-elected mayor with 11 votes.\n\n\n=== Beginning of National Socialism ===\nOn March 15, 1930, a local group of the Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten was founded in Aubing, followed by a local group of the NSDAP on September 30, 1930. Some of its politicians had previously been active in other groups. The future NSDAP mayor Heinrich Graf, for example, had previously been a candidate for the Aubing Free Association. As a counterweight to the Nazi associations, the trade unions, the SPD, the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, the Free Gymnastics, and other associations founded a local group of the Iron Front in Neuaubing on July 23, 1932. On the occasion of the seizure of power on January 30, 1933, the SA and SS organized torchlight parades in Aubing and Neuaubing.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections on March 5, 1933, 3331 eligible voters cast 2940 valid votes. The NSDAP became the strongest party in Aubing, but received only one-third of the votes, about 10% less than the national average. On March 23, the local groups of the Free Gymnasts and the KPD were banned as part of the Enabling Act. After the \"renewal\" of the city council on April 22, only the NSDAP and the BVP were still represented, and Heinrich Graf (NSDAP) became mayor. Four and a half years later, the Ministry of the Interior removed him from office because of a real estate affair. In July 1933, the BVP was also banned.\nFive days after the parliamentary elections, the first arrests and house searches took place in Aubing. The Aubinger-Neuaubinger newspaper of March 15, 1933, reported that \"8 communists were taken into protective custody\" in Aubing and Lochhausen together. Eleven people from Aubing who were imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp between 1933 and 1944 are known by name. As far as can be ascertained, they were imprisoned for\nIn the summer of 1933, Neuaubing union secretary and Reichsbanner leader Josef Lampersberger was a courier for the Sopade, the exiled executive of the SPD in Czechoslovakia. Threatened with arrest, he remained in the Czech border region. Through his father of the same name, he made contact with like-minded people and sent them illegal leaflets. One of these contacts was Gustav Körner from Neuaubing, who knew Franz Faltner, the leader of the Munich resistance group known as the \"Red Rebels\". The group distributed leaflets in Munich until it was exposed in April 1935 and 31 members were arrested, including Körner and Lampersberger's father. The fate of the Lampersbergers is unknown. Körner spent three years in Amberg prison, then in Dachau concentration camp, and finally \"on parole\" in the 999 penal battalion. He survived.\nIn November 1938, Jews Moritz and Kurt Bloch were banned from their company and Kurt was sent to Dachau concentration camp. Both later emigrated.\n\n\n== From 1942: Munich district ==\n\n\n=== Incorporation ===\n\nAfter the Nazis seized power in 1933, the government sought to expand the movement's capital. Riem was incorporated in 1936, followed by Feldmoching, Allach, Untermenzing, Obermenzing, Großhadern, Solln, and Pasing in 1938, making Munich and Aubing neighboring communities.\nIn April 1937, the city of Munich and the community of Aubing began talks about incorporation into Munich. Aubing's representatives were initially open to the idea of incorporation. However, this changed when no agreement could be reached on an incorporation treaty and the majority of Aubing's population was against it. Finally, the Bavarian Reichsstatthalter, Ritter von Epp, decided by decree to incorporate the town on April 1, 1942, without an incorporation treaty. However, it was forbidden to announce the incorporation in the newspaper. After the end of the war, the American administration initially offered to disincorporate the town and restore it to its former status, but the city of Munich prevented this.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\nBetween 1941 and 1945, about 700 forced laborers and prisoners of war were used in Aubing and neighboring Lochhausen. They were housed in seven camps, of which only the Neuaubing prisoner of war camp remains today. Most of the prisoners here were French prisoners of war who worked in the Reichsbahn factory. POWs from a camp in Freiham were used in agriculture. Prisoners from a labor camp in Brunhamstraße and a summer camp in what is now Hohensteinstraße (Neuaubing) worked in the Dornier factory. Another camp was located in Alt-Aubing (Schwemmstraße), where inmates worked in agriculture and as municipal workers. A winter camp was located in Aubing-Ost (today Hellensteinstraße). Besides France, other important countries of origin were Serbia, Croatia, Poland, Russia and the Ukraine.\nIn 1943/44, bombs fell on the Reichsbahn repair shop, the Dornier factory, an anti-aircraft position in the area of today's Neuaubing-West housing development, and a electrical substation in the Aubinger Lohe, causing extensive damage. At least 53 people died. About 400 soldiers from Aubing lost their lives in the war.\nOn the morning of April 30, 1945, the first soldiers of the 7th US Army arrived in Aubing. The day before, several hundred SS men had moved into Aubing to defend it against the Americans. The inhabitants of Aubing tried in vain to persuade them to leave. A local police lieutenant finally succeeded by giving false information about American troop movements. The situation remained tense. Between May and October, police lieutenant Beckerbauer recorded nine murders, four attempted murders, 90 cases of looting, and 95 cases of street robbery. He also reported that on several occasions former prisoners of war had helped to repel looters.\nThe school building of today's Limesschule survived the Second World War undamaged and was used as a refugee camp after the end of the war in 1945. The school was reopened in October 1945. Including the former teacher's room and craft room, there were ten rooms where 1010 children were taught in 16 classes with an average of 46 students in shifts in the morning and afternoon.\n\n\n=== New residential areas ===\n\nThe settlement of Am Westkreuz is located in the easternmost part of Aubing, south of the Munich - Buchloe railroad line and bordered to the east and south by the Pasing - Herrsching railroad line. Before 1964, there was only one farmhouse in this area, the Kreuzhof, on the site of what is now a playhouse. The first apartments on the new estate were occupied in 1966, with plans for a total of 12,000 residents. The planning company responsible, Südhausbau Ltd., named the estate after a planned road junction nearby, but this was never realized: Gotthardstraße, which today ends in Laim, was to cross Bodenseestraße (Bundesstraße 2) there.\nBetween 1965 and 1983, housing for about 22,000 residents was built in the two housing developments Am Westkreuz and Neuaubing-West.\nThe first concrete plans for a new district of Freiham on the fields west of Neuaubing were made in 1963, but construction did not begin until the 21st century (see Freiham).\nWhen Munich's districts were reorganized in 1992, the district of Aubing (39) was merged with the district of Lochhausen-Langwied (40) to form the joint district of Aubing-Lochhausen-Langwied (22). Since then, Aubing is no longer an independent municipality.\n\n\n== Development of the population ==\n\nThe number of graves indicates that the population of the terraced cemetery was approximately 200 individuals during the period of its use, which lasted until around 700. In 1240, the so-called 1st ducal urbarium (an urbarium is a list of property rights) listed 19 farms owned by the sovereign for Aubing (other properties were not counted), representing approximately 30% of the sovereign farms in the Dachau caste office. In 1530, Aubing had a population of just over 400, making it one of the largest villages in the district court of Dachau. Following the devastation of the Thirty Years' War, this population figure was not surpassed until the 18th century. In 1810, the census recorded a population of 479 inhabitants, 165 children, and 114 servants, for a total of 758 individuals.\nA census conducted in 1900 revealed a population of 1,431 inhabitants. In the subsequent census conducted five years after the opening of the Central Railway Workshop, the population had increased to 2,644, including 168 Protestants. Between the two world wars, the population more than doubled again, from 3,928 in 1925 to 9,443 in 1939.\nFollowing its incorporation in 1942, the population of the area grew at a relatively slow pace, reaching 13,094 by the 1960s. However, the 1970 census revealed a significant increase in the number of residents, with the new settlements of Am Westkreuz and Neuaubing-West contributing to a substantial growth in population. In just ten years, the population had increased to over 27,000, a figure that was more than double the previous census count. From 1950 to 1970, the population was recorded separately for the \"Aubing\" and \"Neuaubing\" districts, which were located north and south of the Munich-Buchloe railroad line, respectively. These figures corroborate the notion that the substantial population growth is largely concentrated in the \"Neuaubing\" district, where the population increased from 7,557 in 1950 to 8,707 in 1961 and 22,436 in 1970. In contrast, the \"Aubing\" district exhibited a relatively modest increase, from 3,748 to 4,606 inhabitants over the same period.\nThe 1987 census revealed a population of 30,181 for the entire municipality of Aubing, representing a 10% increase over the previous 17 years. Following the merger of the districts of Aubing (39) and Lochhausen-Langwied (40) in 1992 to form the joint district of Aubing-Lochhausen-Langwied (22), the figures were only reported collectively. Consequently, the former Lochhausen-Langwied figures are also required for the comparison.\nIn the smaller Lochhausen-Langwied district, the 1987 census enumerated a population of 5,369. Five years before their unification, the two districts collectively had 35,550 inhabitants.\nThe City of Munich has published various reports on the subject, which present slightly different figures for the same census. According to another source, the combined population in the 1987 census was 37,421. The latest update of the statistics showed 37,425 inhabitants for the combined district on December 31, 2000, and 38,327 on December 31, 2008.\n\n\n== Confrontation with history ==\n\nIn 1905, Josef Steinbacher, a native of the Upper Palatinate, assumed the role of \"teacher, choir director, and sacristan\" in Aindling. Before his death in Aubing in 1922, he also became the parish secretary and the founder of an association. In 1914, he published his 144-page booklet, \"Aubing Pfarrdorf bei München,\" which provides a comprehensive account of the history and development of the village. The first major treatise to deal with the history of Aubing, \"How it came about, how it was and how it is\", was published in 1914. In the foreword, Steinbacher expressed his concerns about the rural exodus in the \"Bavarian fatherland\" at the time and finally his hope and motivation: \"Through knowledge of our homeland, we will then also regain a love of our homeland.\"\nSteinbacher made further extensive records. A first revision was published in 1929 by his successor, teacher Moser, in the magazine Altheimatland. The original manuscripts were discovered in 1980 in the estate of one of his daughters in nearby Planegg. As a result, the Aubing Parish Church Foundation published Steinbacher's History of the 99 Houses of Aubing in 1981. In 1983, the foundation published a reprint of Steinbacher's initial publication. In 2003, the Aubing Archive released a five-volume work titled Chronica Aubingensis, which was authored by Steinbacher. Collectively, Steinbacher's writings serve as a valuable source of information for local history. In 1982, a street in Aubing was named after him.\n\n\n=== Aubing archive ===\nIn 1992, the district committee of the Aubing-Lochhausen-Langwied district organized a photo competition on Aubing's past to mark the 50th anniversary of its incorporation. Both the competition and the accompanying exhibition, \"From village to town - 50 years of Aubing in Munich,\" which was held in April 1992, were well received. In July 1993, the organizers took this opportunity to found the Aubing Archive, which since then has been dedicated to \"collecting and archiving historical and contemporary documents on the subject of Aubing and Neuaubing.\" Between 1995 and 2006, the archive published about two dozen publications, which are available on the website.\n\n\n=== 1000 years of documentary mention ===\nJust in time for the 1000th anniversary of the first documentary mention of Aubing in 2010, the Association 1000 Years Charter of Aubing e.V. was founded in 2008 to \"organize the festival year 2010 with its own contributions and to coordinate the supporting program\". Among the numerous events during the celebration year were an exhibition in April/May 2010 entitled \"From the beginnings to the beginning of the 19th century\" and another in September 2010, which covered the period from secularization to after the Second World War. The first exhibition presented some of the archaeological finds from the terraced cemetery in Aubing to the public for the first time. The second exhibition was organized by members of the Aubing Archives.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStadtbezirk 22: Aubing-Lochhausen-Langwied. In: KulturGeschichtsPfad.

        "content": "Catherine Mahugu (born c.1988) is a Kenyan entrepreneur who has receive wide recognition for the companies she has created to allow producers to seel their products direct to the consumer. Her first company, Soko, involved hand-made products like jewellery and her second company Chiswara sells Kenyan coffee. She has received several fellowships and she was included in the Forbes 30 under 30 and the BBC 100 Women lists.\n\n\n== Life ==\nMahugu was born in about 1988 and decided to study computer science because she wanted to be a woman in STEM. Marketing and communications were seen as more appropriate subjects but she rejected them. Early in her software career she was involved with applications to help people find clean water and to help people with disabilities to read. She had worked with Stanford University students.\n\nShe worked with Gwendolyn Floyd and Ella Peinovich to created an e-commerce site and app. They had seen artisans spending a day in the Maasai market place trying to sell their creations for little or no return. They thought that they could improve on this business model. The application they made allows users to sell their hand-crafted jewelery and to receive a share of the sale price. The problems were not just software and funding but also culture. The infrastructure required to deliver and collect goods and payment was not guaranteed or trusted in Kenya. The company had to employ people to bridge that gap and improve confidence in online selling.\nMahugu made the 30 under 30 part of the BBC 100 women list in 2015. Before the age of thirty, Mahugu, she was chosen to be in the Forbes 30 under 30 list. She believes this is due to setting herself no limits.\nIn 2023, she was featured in UNCTAD's eighth World Investment Forum in Dubai. There she was talking about abother business called Chiswara which allows consumers to buy coffee from the people who make it.\n\n\n== Speaking ==\nMahunga has received a number of fellowships and invitations to speak at events organised by the World Bank, the BBC, Harvard University, The Economist and The Financial Times.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Heavy Music Awards (HMAs) are awards presented by The Heavy Group to recognize outstanding achievements in heavy music. It operates as both an annual awards ceremony and a live event. The first ceremony was held on 24 August 2017. Whilst its nominees are selected from a panel of people involved in the heavy music industry, its winners are selected by an online vote.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Heavy Music Awards were conceived in late 2016 by Dave Bradley and Andy Pritchard, and announced on 1 March 2017 by their joint venture The Heavy Group. Pritchard has stated that they set up the awards with the intention of \"[treating] heavy music as a legitimate art form\", with the hopes that the event would offer increased recognition and exposure for those involved in the scene/genre. The inaugural Heavy Music Awards ceremony, held on 24 August 2017 at the House of Vans in London, received 97,000 votes. The ceremony was broadcast on the British TV channel Scuzz on 16 September 2017. The 2018 edition, which took place on 22 August 2018 at KOKO in London, received 131,000 votes. The 2019 ceremony took place at the larger O2 Forum Kentish Town and was hosted by Laura Jane Grace of Against Me!.\nIn November 2019, the Heavy Music Awards moved its annual date from August to May. The Heavy Music Awards 2020 was due to take place on 21 May 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, it was instead livestreamed on the Amazon Music UK Twitch channel on 3 September 2020, with its ceremony and live performers being filmed in differing locations. The ceremony drew in 150,000 votes and was watched by 177,000 people online. The 2021 edition Heavy Metal Awards was held as both an in-person event (at the O2 Forum Kentish Town) and a livestream, and saw a sharp increase in voters; between 16 June and 14 July 2021, the awards finalists collectively received over 1.4 million votes. The livestream was shut down by Twitch after Milkie Way of Wargasm suffered a wardrobe malfunction that exposed her nipples whilst performing onstage with Trash Boat, leading the Heavy Metal Awards channel to be striked for nudity and suspended for three days. Way refused to apologize for the incident, whilst Trash Boat vocalist Tobi Duncan accused Twitch of using a double standard, as both musicians were wearing outfits that exposed their nipples during the performance.\nThe 2023 edition was hosted at the OVO Arena Wembley, drawing in a crowd of 5,000 and receiving over 1.3 million votes from people in 161 countries.\n\n\n== Awards process ==\nNominees are selected for the Heavy Music Awards from a panel of people involved in the heavy music industry, from the UK and internationally. They are invited to list their top three albums for any given category, given it has been released in the previous year (between 1 January and 31 December) and fits specific criteria. The HMA has no say in selecting its finalists. The top 7 artists in each category are then listed as finalists that are voted on by the general public on the Heavy Music Awards website. Its trophies are manufactured by Gaudio Awards.\nThe Heavy Music Awards 2017 had an panel size of 300+ personnel, which has been expanded upon with its subsequent editions. The panel for the Heavy Music Awards 2024 is made up of almost 1,000 personnel.\n\n\n== List of ceremonies ==\n\n\n== Award categories ==\n\n\n=== Voted categories ===\nAs of the Heavy Music Awards 2024, nominees can win in the following categories:\n\nBest Album\nBest Breakthrough Album\nBest UK Artist (awarded as Best UK band from 2017 to 2021)\nBest UK Live Artist\nBest International Artist (awarded as Best International Band from 2017 to 2021)\nBest International Live Artist\nBest Breakthrough Live Artist\nBest UK Breakthrough Artist (awarded as Best UK Breakthrough Band from 2017 to 2022)\nBest International Breakthrough Artist (awarded as Best International Breakthrough Band from 2017 to 2022)\nBest Album Artwork\n\n\n=== Non-voted categories ===\nThe H (awarded for \"exceptional positive contribution to the heavy music scene\")\nPioneer (awarded for \"groundbreaking approach to artistry and presentation\")\nIcon (presented for \"exceptional long-standing positive contribution to the heavy music scene\")\n\n\n=== Retired categories ===\nBest Photographer (2017 to 2020)\nBest Live Band (2017 to 2020), Best Live Artist (2021 to 2022)\nBest Festival (2017 to 2023)\nBest Production (2017 to 2023) (awarded as Best Producer from 2017 to 2020)\nBest Video (2020 to 2023)\nBest Podcast (2021 to 2022)\nBest Single (2021 to 2023)\n\n\n=== One-off categories ===\nBest Breakthrough Band (2017)\nBest Venue (2017)\nInnovation Award (2022) (awarded for \"for innovative application of new ideas for the greater good of the heavy music scene\")\n\n\n== List of Heavy Music Awards winners and nominees ==\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in bold.\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\nThe H award was posthumously given to Kerrang! photographer Ashley Maile, and was accepted by on his behalf by his wife Caroline, sister Carly and friend Paul Harries.\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\nThe H Award was given to the Dixon family.

        "content": "\n== Introduction ==\nThe Battle of Cape São Vicente in 1676 was a notable naval engagement between the Portuguese ship Nossa Senhora da Madre de Deus and a Barbary pirate frigate. This incident occurred during a period of maritime trade between Mazagão and Lisbon, amidst the prevalence of piracy in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Nossa Senhora da Madre de Deus, returning from Mazagão, encountered difficulties and was forced to seek refuge in Lagos due to a leak. After repairs, the ship resumed its journey towards Lisbon, but encountered further challenges near Cape São Vicente.\n\n\n== Encounter ==\nIn the vicinity of Cape São Vicente, the Nossa Senhora da Madre de Deus was attacked by a Barbary pirate frigate. The pirates, likely motivated by the valuable cargo aboard the Portuguese vessel, initiated the assault, leading to a fierce confrontation.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nThe battle between the Nossa Senhora da Madre de Deus and the pirate frigate lasted for three hours. Despite their best efforts, the crew of the Portuguese ship inflicted considerable damage on the pirate vessel, but were ultimately forced to abandon the fight due to the severity of the damages suffered.\n\n\n== Outcome ==\nThe Nossa Senhora da Madre de Deus, unable to continue the battle, retreated from the engagement zone. The Barbary pirate frigate, though also damaged, likely claimed victory in the encounter, as the Portuguese ship was forced to abandon the fight and proceed with its journey to Lisbon.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Battle of Cape São Vicente in 1676 serves as a reminder of the dangers faced by maritime vessels during the age of piracy in the Atlantic Ocean. It underscores the constant threat posed by pirates to maritime trade routes and the resilience of sailors in defending their ships against such attacks.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was assigned to the Caborca mission for two years, before relocating in 1722 to Mission Santa María Magdalena. In 1725 he became the administrator of the Altar River valley, and accordingly relocated to San Ignacio. \nGallardi moved again in 1727 to Tubutama, where he served for the rest of his life. A 1730 account describes Gallardi punishing two of the native Pima, and the natives retaliating by shooting arrows into Gallardi's room while he slept. Juan Bautista Grazhoffer assisted Gallardi at the mission for a few months, leaving in 1732. Gallardi died in Tubutama on January 1, 1736.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The British Colloquium for Logic (BLC) is registered charity, founded in 1977, that represents the interests of Logic in the UK, with an aim for promoting formal and mathematical logic, and subjects related to formal and mathematical logic.\nThe BLC operates under the direction of a committee, with an executive consisting of a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. The current president is Jonathan Kirby.\nThe purpose of the BLC is:\n\nto support, promote, and foster the study of logic.\nto encourage the communication of logicians across disciplines within the UK.\nto provide financial support for logic-related conferences, workshops, summer schools, and research visits across the UK.\nto hold an Annual Meeting with talks on logic in mathematics, philosophy and computer science.\nIn pursuit of these aims, the BLC organises an annual conference for researchers in logic. A central aspect of the annual BLC Conference is a workshop for PhD students, and support for PhD students is a key criterion in the awarding of funding.  The scope of the annual BCTCS Conference includes all aspects of logic, including mathematical logic, logic in computer science, philosophical logic, and the history of logic.  To represent the breadth of logic within the UK, the BLC always actively solicits participants from all of the above areas to offer an environment where members of the various logical communities can meet and exchange ideas.\n\n\n== History of the BLC ==\nThe BLC grew out of informal meetings of logicians first arranged by Arthur Prior in the 1950s.  These meetings were first formalized in 1965, and the BLC was registered as a charity in 1978.\n\n\n== Past officers of the BLC ==\n\n\n=== Presidents ===\nRobin Gandy\nJohn Shepherdson\nWilfrid Hodges\nStan Wainer\nJeff Paris (2005–2007)\nMartin Hyland (2008–2013)\nDugald Macpherson (2014–2017)\nPhilip Welch (2017–2022)\nJonathan Kirby (2023-)\n\n\n=== Vice-presidents ===\nMartin Hyland (2005–2007)\nProf Williamson (2008–2013)\nPhilip Welch (2014–2016)\nVolker Halbach (2017–2022)\nSara L.

        "content": "Deep in the Blues is an album by the American musician James Cotton, released in 1996. It peaked at No. 13 on Billboard's Blues Albums chart. Deep in the Blues won a Grammy Award for \"Best Traditional Blues Album\". It also won a W. C. Handy Award for best \"Acoustic Blues Album\". Cotton supported the album with a North American tour.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by John Snyder. Cotton was backed by Joe Louis Walker on guitar and Charlie Haden on bass. \"Strange Things Happen\" is a cover of the Percy Mayfield song. \"Dealin' with the Devil\" is a version of the Sonny Boy Williamson I song. \"You Got My Nose Open\" was written by Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy. \"Worried Life Blues\" is a take on the Big Maceo Merriweather song.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nThe Edmonton Journal determined that, \"if Haden and Walker are out of their regular context they sound happy to be there, offering a tasty, enthusiastic backup that propels the harp man to some fine blowing.\" The Los Angeles Daily News praised the \"surprisingly rootsy, all-acoustic sound.\" Guitar Player said that \"easy-swinging Joe conjures a prewar vibe as he delves into mojo boogies and slow blues.\"\nThe Sun-Sentinel opined that, \"with Cotton's hound-dog singing out front and center, the harp's wail pierces the sandpapery vocal wall like a laser.\" The Chicago Tribune lamented that \"nothing can camouflage the truckload of gravel strewn atop Cotton's once-roaring pipes.\" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concluded that the album \"captures the blues harp master at the absolute top of his game, groanin' and moanin' about the hold misery's got on his soul.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"the sound is intimate and raw, which is a welcome change from Cotton's usual overproduced records.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The São José Incident of 1674 refers to a notable maritime encounter between the Portuguese ship São José and a group of pirates in the year 1674. This incident occurred during a period when piracy was rampant in the Atlantic Ocean, posing a significant threat to maritime trade routes and vessels.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe São José was a merchant ship that had embarked on a voyage from Hamburg, Germany, bound for Lisbon, Portugal. Laden with goods and supplies, it was a valuable target for pirates seeking plunder along the busy trade routes of the Atlantic.\n\n\n== Encounter ==\nIn 1674, while en route to Lisbon, the São José encountered four pirate ships, crewed by marauders described as barbaric. These pirates, likely motivated by the prospect of seizing the valuable cargo aboard the São José, initiated an attack on the vessel.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nA fierce battle ensued between the São José and the pirate ships. The crew of the São José, though outnumbered and facing significant odds, mounted a spirited defense, determined to protect their ship and its cargo. The engagement lasted for several hours, during which both sides sustained casualties and the São José suffered considerable damage.\n\n\n== Outcome ==\nDespite their valiant efforts, the crew of the São José was ultimately unable to repel the pirate attackers entirely. After hours of intense fighting, the pirates managed to inflict significant damage on the São José and its crew, forcing them to retreat. The pirates, satisfied with their plunder and fearing retaliation, eventually withdrew from the scene, allowing the São José to continue its voyage, albeit battered and bruised.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe São José Incident of 1674 serves as a testament to the dangers faced by merchant ships and sailors during the age of piracy. It highlights the bravery and resilience of those who navigated the treacherous waters of the Atlantic Ocean, contending with the constant threat of pirate attacks. While the specific details of the São José Incident may have faded over time, its memory endures as a reminder of the perils of maritime travel in centuries past.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Donnel Foster Hewett  (June 24, 1881, Irwin, Pennsylvania – February 5, 1971) was an American geologist and mineralogist, known for his leading role in the 1905 discovery of the Minas Ragra vanadium ore deposit in Peru. This ore deposit was the world's principal source of vanadium for more than 30 years. Hewett, with Earl V. Shannon, described and named orientite, a mineral rich in manganese.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nD. Foster Hewett (known to friends and acquaintances as Foster Hewett) was born to George C. Hewett and Hetty Barclay Foster Hewett. George C. Hewett was an outstanding engineer in the coal-mining industry of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Hetty Hewett died in 1884 when D. Foster Hewett was only three years old. He was raised until 1895 in Washington, D.C. in the household of Hetty Hewett's sister, who was married and had four children of her own. During the years from 1885 to 1893, George Hewett was in charge of operating mines in Colorado and Wyoming and generally visited his son once a year in Washington, D.C. In Colorado in the summers of 1888 and 1892, D. Foster Hewett visited his father, who encouraged him to study mineralogy. In 1895 George Hewett remarried and became an employee of the Southern Railway Company. D. Foster Hewett moved in 1895 with his father and step-mother to Atlanta, Georgis, and in autumn of that year entered the Georgia School of Technology (now renamed Georgia Institute of Technology). After a year and a half there, he dropped out to attend a local business college and in the autumn of 1897 was employed for several months as a stenographer and typist before some more education in Washington, D.C. In the autumn of 1898 he enrolled as a student of chemistry, metallurgy, and mining at Lehigh University. There he graduated in 1902 with a bachelor's degree in metallurgy and was taught and inspired by Joseph Barrell in geology and petrology, Joseph William Richards (1864–1921) in metallurgy and blowpiping, and John Lammey Stewart (1867–1927) in economics.\nIn 1903, after a year as an instructor in metallurgy and mineralogy at Lehigh University, Hewett became employed as a mining engineer for Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory, a company known for pioneering research on aluminum and Portland cement. From 1903 to 1909 Hewett investigated, mapped, and reported on mineral resources involving many commercially important minerals in the US, Mexico, Canada, and Peru. Most notably, he was primarily responsible for discovering the Minas Ragra vanadium ore deposit, thus revolutionizing the production of vanadium steel. In January 1909 he married Mary Amelia Hamilton. In 1909 he became a graduate student in geology at Yale University to study under his mentor and friend Joseph Barrell. After two years. he completed his residence requirements for a Ph.D. in geology, but his Ph.D. thesis and the award of the Ph.D. were delayed until 1924.\nIn spring 1911, Hewett took a three-day U.S. Civil Service examination and attained a high score. On the 1st of June, he joined the United States Geological Survey (USGS) as a Junior Geologist. Except for two leaves of absence, he spent the rest of his life as a USGS employee. His 1st assignment, which lasted about 2 years, was to do fieldwork with Charles Thomas Lupton (1878–1935) in the coal fields of Wyoming's Big Horn Basin. Hewett made important contributions to region's stratigraphy, discovered the Heart Mountain thrust fault, and demonstrated that bentonite is an alternation product of volcanic ash. He elucidated the systematic tilting of the Big Horn Basin's anticlines, and this research on the anticlines was later valuable to petroleum producers. Later USGS assignments were to Oklahoma for research on petroleum and manganese, to Oregon to study, with Joseph T. Pardee, gold ores in Oregon's Blue Mountains, and to Cuba to study ore deposits for manganese and iron. In June 1921, the American Journal of Science published Hewett and Shannon's discovery of a new mineral found in Cuba's Oriente Province. In autumn 1921 Hewett began an extensive mapping program for the geology and ore deposition of the southern Great Basin — the program, with various periods of interruption, occupied him until he was no longer fit for strenuous fieldwork. His Great Basin research started in Nevada's Goodsprings mining district. In 1924 Hewett announced his discovery of the close association of dolomitization with deposition of lead and zinc ores. This discovery soon became used as a guide by geologist all over the world to identify such ore deposits of lead and zinc. He subsequently demonstrated that some classic ore deposits in Europe were encased in hydrothermal dolomite like the Goodsprings ores, but some lead and zinc deposit, such as those associated with the mines of Laurium, have no dolomite mantles. After completing his study in the Goodsprings area, he did geological mapping of the much larger area of the Ivanpah Quadrangle, which covers about 3,900 square miles (10,100 square kilometers) in the northeastern part of the Mojave Desert of southeastern California and southern Nevada. There he demonstrated remarkable continuity between underlying Precambrian rocks and overlying Paleozoic rocks.\nMany U.S. geologists often called Hewett \"Mr. Manganese\", because of his outstanding research in manganese mineralogy and ore deposition, which gained him international recognition. In 1912 Hewett had been given responsibility for preparing a chapter on manganese for the USGS's annual publication on mineral resources of the United States. For seven years he provided definitive summaries entitled “Manganese and Manganiferous Ores.” During WW I the USGS assigned him to evaluate manganese deposits in the US, because the German submarine campaign threatened to cut off the normal supply of manganese from South Africa and Brazil. He was also involved in study of manganese deposits in Arizona and Nevada, fieldwork in Alaska, and a resources survey of the parts of Nevada and Arizona around Hoover Dam.\nHewett gained a reputation for tact in dealing with people, as well as breadth of knowledge about geology and mineralogy. In 1933 Hewett was sent to investigate, in collaboration with Geoffrey W. Crickmay (1905–1971), the thermal waters of Warm Springs in Georgia. Many influential people, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, believed those particular waters had outstanding healing properties for unknown reasons. Hewett and Crickmay found that the spring waters had no exceptional physical or chemical properties and merely originated from rainfall that fell on a nearby mountain, went downward through a bed of permeable quartzite, and returned upward along a fault. A specially bound copy of their report Water-Supply Paper 819 was sent to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the report's receipt was never acknowledged.\nIn 1935 Hewett became Chief of the USGS's Metalliferous Geology Section and developed a program for the exploration of strategically important minerals and ores, which became of great importance during WW II. This work during WW II was interrupted by health problems and in 1945 he had to undergo kidney surgery. He and his wife settled in Pasadena, where Caltech offered him laboratory space, and from there he supervised and advised the USGS's mineral searches. In 1949 he was involved in the discovery of a large deposit of rare earths near Mountain Pass, California. There he identified and established the abundance of an ore deposit of the mineral bastnasite, which is scarce worldwide. Hewett was supposed to undergo mandatory retirement in 1951 when he became 70 years old, but an unsolicited executive order from President Harry S. Truman returned Hewett to USGS active duty with no terminal date. When he was no longer able to do much fieldwork, he continued his laboratory studies of manganese mineralogy. He worked with many specialists in sophisticated analytical techniques and shifted his headquarters to the USGS office in Menlo Park, California. There he remained remarkably productive until his death at age 89 — at the time of his death, two of his papers were in press.\nD. Foster Hewett died in 1971 after more than 62 years of marriage. His widow, who often accompanied him in his geological fieldwork, died about 6 months later. He left a bequest which was used by Lehigh University to establish an annual Donnel Foster Hewett Lecture Series\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nHewett, a long-time member of the Geological Society of America (GSA), served on the GSA Council from 1931 to 1933 and as GSA vice-president in 1935 and again in 1945. He served as president of the Society of Economic Geologists (SEG) in 1936. He was elected in 1937 a Member of the National Academy of Sciences and in 1950 a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1942 he was awarded an honorary D.Sc. by Lehigh University. He received in 1951 the U.S. Department of the Interior's Distinguished Service Medal, in 1951 the SEG's Penrose Gold Medal, and in 1964 the GSA's Penrose Medal.\nThe vanadium minerals hewettite and metahewettie are named in his honor.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nHewett, D.

        "content": "Castle of Ronse (Dutch: Kasteel van Ronse or French: Château de Renaix) is a former palace in Ronse, Belgium. It was built in 1630 by count John VIII of Nassau-Siegen to serve as the ‘ancestral castle’ of the catholic branch of the House of Nassau. It was designed in renaissance style and modelled after the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. It was demolished due to political unwillingness in 1823. Except for some foundations below a 19th-century villa, nothing remains anymore of what was once considered one of the most beautiful castle of the Southern Netherlands.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancestral castle of catholic branch of the House of Nassau ===\nJohn VIII of Nassau-Siegen (1583–1638) was grand-nephew of Philip William, Prince of Orange (1554–1618), Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange (1584–1647), and elder brother of John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen (1604–1679). John had a successful career in the armies of the Holy Roman Empire, the Dutch Republic, France and Savoye. In 1612, he converted to Catholicism, settled down in the Southern Netherlands and married princess Ernestine Yolande de Ligne (1594–1668). He was considered by the Habsburg governors as the head of the House of Nassau. When prince Philip William passed away, he was granted his former properties: the Nassau palace in Brussels, the seigniories of Grimbergen, Zichem and Diest, and the barony of Breda.\nOn 28 March 1629, John VIII of Nassau-Siegen acquired the barony of Ronse from the last descendants of the Granvelle family. In April 1630, he started the construction of a palace modelled after the Luxembourg palace in Paris and Huis Honselaarsdijk created by Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange (1584–1647). John VIII was also the first lord to reside regularly in Ronse.\nThe castle of Ronse became a monumental palace, intended to serve as the ancestral castle of the Catholic branch of the Nassau family in the Southern Netherlands. John VIII van Nassau spent almost all his financial resources on the castle, which was completed after the plague epidemic of 1635–1636. Love for building was strong in the family, his protestant brother John Maurice constructed the Mauritshuis in The Hague, Sonnenburg castle in Brandenburg, and the Prinsenhof in Kleve.\nThe castle of Ronse was a U-shaped palace in late renaissance style on a square plan of 58 metres by 72 metres in five stories, consisting of a gatehouse, a central courtyard with an extensive residential wing and a chapel at the rear, two side wings, and four corner towers with a height of 37 meters. The castle was constructed of red brick with natural stone elements such as windows, arcades, profiled moldings, and corner blocks. The arrangement of the rooms was almost symmetrical, with two large apartments in the corners and the main public spaces, the entrance gate, and the chapel, on the central axis. The chapel was two stories high and featured a gallery on the first floor and an extended apse in the middle of the rear facade. The grand salon was located on the floor above the hall and opened onto the chapel.\nPainted portraits of the entire Nassau family tree hung in the vestibule. The famous portrait of Jan van Nassau and his family, painted by Anthony van Dyck in 1634, hung in the left antechamber. This painting is now a masterpiece in the Cowper Collection in Firle Place, assembled by George Nassau Cowper (1738–1789), the third Earl Cowper, who inherited the painting from Henry de Nassau d'Auverquerque (1675–1754), the first Earl of Grantham. A detailed description of the former furnishings exists, detailing the furniture, paintings, and carpets that were present at the time.\nJohn VIII of Nassau-Siegen was colonel of a German regiment and later became general of the cavalry in Flanders. After his death on 29 July 1638, his widow Ernestine Yolande de Ligne continued to live in the castle until 1663. After her death in 1669, the lords of Ronse hardly ever stayed in Ronse.\nThe successors were John's son, John Francis Desideratus, Prince of Nassau-Siegen (1627–1699), his sons William Hyacinth, Prince of Nassau-Siegen (1667–1743) and Emmanuel Ignatius of Nassau-Siegen (1688–1735). These heirs of John VIII of Nassau were entangled in prolonged and complicated disputes over the ownership rights of the barony, among other things, and ultimately the barony was sold to the counts of Merode-Westerloo (1745–1795), who, apart from their joyful entries, never actually stayed there.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nAfter the Battle of Fleurus on 26 June 1794, the barony was abolished, and the castle was put up for sale after centuries of being owned by the illustrious families of Nassau-Siegen and Merode. From then on, the castle quickly began to decay into a ruin. Alexandre Louis van Hove bought the castle from the Merodes, but could not maintain the building alone. In 1821, he offered it for a modest sum to the city council as a hospital or secondary school, but his archrival Eugène Ferdinand Fostier, who had become mayor again in 1820, rejected the offer, further contributing to the castle's decay.\nNapoleon's reign ushered in the first modern textile industry in Ronse, and the castle became the first location for the emerging textile industry. In 1803, the Lousbergs brothers introduced the first large cotton weaving mill in the city with 180 looms in the castle's cellars.\n\n\n=== Demolition ===\nUltimately, the castle was sold in 1823 for 30,000 francs and demolished as a result of the feud between the conservative Van Hove family, who had been the representatives of the lord during the ancien régime, and the progressive Fostier family.\n\n\n=== Villa Snoeck ===\nIn 1844, notary Charles Alexander Snoeck was appointed to divide the assets of the Van Hove heirs, and the 20-hectare estate was subdivided. He acquired a large number of lands himself and built several small houses in the 1850s, a tenement now known as the \"Snoecksteegje\". Through the subdivision of the former estate, the city began to expand beyond its old small core in the 1850s-60s for the first time.\nIn addition, notary Charles Alexander Snoeck had a villa built for his son, the renowned musicologist César Snoeck, on the foundations and basement of the gatehouse of the demolished castle. Thus, the 17th-century barrel vaults in the basement with one-meter-thick whitewashed brick walls and door openings with sandstone casings were preserved. The backyard of Villa Snoeck was the former courtyard of the castle and is still bordered by the old walls or foundations of the castle.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nGoethgebhuer, P.J.

        "content": "The Ordrup velodrome was a cycling track in Ordrup near Copenhagen, Denmark. The track was built on Ejgaarden's land in the Gentofte Municipality in 1888 and was closed in 2000. It hosted the world track cycling championships for a record of nine times: in 1896, 1903, 1909, 1914, 1921, 1931, 1949 and 1956.\n\n\n== History ==\nOrdrupbanen had its heyday in the years leading up to World War II with Danish world stars such as Thorvald Ellegaard and Willy Falck Hansen repeatedly drawing full houses to Ordrupbanen. The good cycling races, often several times a week, the very large prize money, good cycslst conditions and many spectators meant that all the big international names absolutely wanted to race at Ordrupbanen. Back then, the spectators hung on the roofs around the track, where up to 16,000 spectators could be seen. After the war, it was riders such as Kay Werner and Palle Lykke who attracted big crowds.\nThe first track premiered on 29 July 1888. It was a 333 1/3 m long sand track without raised corners.\nIn 1893, the second track became a 333 1/3 m cement track with slightly raised corners.\nAfter a major renovation in 1903, the third track became a 370 m cement track with 40 degree turns. The track was 9 metres wide.\nIn 1930–31, Henning Hansen built a 110 metre long grandstand facing Brannersvej. In 1935, a new referee's tower and cabin building were added. The cabin house replaced the round equestrian centre from 1895, which had been in use for forty years.\n\nA fourth track with new cement was ready on 10 May 1987. The new track was 1.80 metres shorter (368.20 m). Due to the renovation, the Ordrup track was not used in 1986.\nThe final race on 3 September 2000 marked the end of the Danish Bicycle Club's 120-year history at Ordrupbanen. The track was then the world's oldest existing cycle track. The sale of the old track brought the Danish Bicycle Club DKK 18 million. This money was used to build the cycling arena in Ballerup. Today, the area where the Ordrup track was located has been developed with housing and a new era has begun with the construction of Ballerup Super Arena.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cycling tracks and velodromes\n\n\n== References ==",

As built, she could reach a maximum speed of 28.5 knots (52.8 km/h; 32.8 mph). Originally, she had a fuel capacity of 95 tonnes (93 long tons) of coal, giving her a range of 1,500 nautical miles (2,800 km; 1,700 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph) and 400 nautical miles (740 km; 460 mi) at 23.5 knots (43.5 km/h; 27.0 mph); she later was converted to burn fuel oil, with a fuel capacity of 65 tonnes (64 long tons) of oil. She was fitted with four 76-millimetre (3 in)/40 calibre guns and three 450-millimetre (17.7 in) torpedo tubes.\n\n\n== Construction and commissioning ==\nGaribaldino was laid down on 23 October 1905 at the Gio. Ansaldo & C. shipyard in Genoa, Italy. She was launched on 12 February 1910 and completed on 1 June 1910. She was commissioned in June 1910.\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\n\n=== Italo-Turkish War ===\nThe Italo-Turkish War began on 29 September 1911 with the Kingdom of Italy′s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire. At the time, Garibaldino was part of the 4th Destroyer Division along with her sister ships Bersagliere, Granatiere, and Lanciere. That day, she became the first ship to enter the port of Tripoli on the coast of Ottoman Tripolitania, where she demanded the port's surrender. Covered by the torpedo cruiser Coatit, she and Lanciere also conducted a close reconnaissance on 29 September of Argub beach, east of Tripoli, where the Italians expected to land troops for the seizure of Tripoli.  By 30 September 1911, she was participating along with Coatit, Lanciere, the battleships Napoli and Roma, the armored cruisers Francesco Ferruccio, Giuseppe Garibaldi, and Varese, and the destroyers Euro, Freccia, Ostro, and Strale in a blockade of Tripoli.\nIn January 1912 Garibaldino, her sister ship Artigliere,  and the protected cruiser Piemonte deployed to the Red Sea to search for Ottoman ships along the coast. On 7 January 1912 Artigliere came across a large group of Ottoman ships – the gunboats Ayintag (or Antep), Bafra, Gökçedağ, Kastamonu, Ordu, and Refahiye, the armed tug Muha, and the armed steam yacht Şipka (formerly Fuad, Fauwette, or Fouvette) — in the harbor at Kunfuda on the coast of the Arabian Peninsula. The Ottoman vessels moved to attack Artigliere, and Garibaldino and Piemonte rushed to her aid. The ensuing clash, the Battle of Kunfuda Bay, lasted for three hours. Opening fire at a range of 4,500 metres (4,900 yd), the Italians sank three of the gunboats and forced the other three to beach themselves to avoid sinking, their crews fleeing after reaching shore. Sources do not mention the fate of Muha. On 8 January, the Italian ships returned and put ashore landing parties which completed the destruction of the beached gunboats after salvaging guns and trophies from them. The ships then bombarded Kunfuda and captured four Arab dhows. After the Ottoman troops in the area fled, a landing party from Piemonte occupied the town. Sources are unclear as to whether Şipka sank or remained afloat during the events of 7–8 January, but agree that the Italians seized her as a prize, towed her to Massawa, and later took her to Italy, where she was incorporated into the Regia Marina as the gunboat Cunfuda.\nThe war ended on 18 October 1912 in an Italian victory.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nWorld War I broke out in 1914, and Italy entered the war on the side of the Allies with its declaration of war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915. At the time, Garibaldino, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) De Grossi, was part of the 3rd Destroyer Squadron, based at Brindisi, which also included Artigliere, Bersagliere, Lanciere, and their sister ship Corrazziere. On 24 May 1915, the day after Italy's declaration of war, Garibaldino, Lanciere, and their sister ships Alpino, Carabiniere, and Fuciliere conducted a patrol in the upper Adriatic Sea.\nOn 29 May 1915 Garibaldino, Artigliere, Bersagliere, and Lanciere bombarded the Adria Werke chemical plant in Monfalcone, a production site for poison gases, while Alpino, Corazziere, and their sister ship Pontiere provided support.\n The ships carried out another bombardment of the Adria Werke on 7 June 1915.\nOn 23 February 1916, under the command of Capitano di fregata (Frigate Captain) Brescia, Garibaldino, Bersagliere, and Corazziere escorted 12 steamers and two tugs to Durrës (known to the Italians as Durazzo) on the coast of the Principality of Albania.\nIn October 1916 Garibaldino, her sister ship Ascaro, the destroyers Borea and Nembo, and four torpedo boats provided protection and support to a landing force consisting of Francesco Ferruccio and the steamers Ausonia, Bulgaria, Choising, and Polcevera sent to occupy Sarandë (known to the Italians as Santi Quaranta) in Albania. At 05:15 on 2 October 1916, four platoons of sailors, a unit of miners, and a unit of personnel from Francesco Ferruccio landed on the beach and quickly occupied the area, the 32 members of the Greek garrison at Sarandë having no option other than to retreat after protesting the Italian operation. After disembarking an infantry battalion and a cavalry squadron, the steamers departed at 16:00 on 2 October for Vlorë, where they embarked more troops. On 3 October, Ausonia and Polcevera landed a pack artillery battery and a second cavalry squadron, and on 4 October the operation was completed when Bulgaria and Choising put another infantry battalion and a third cavalry squadron ashore.\nOn 16 July 1918 Garibaldino sank in the Mediterranean Sea off Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, after a collision with the British naval trawler HMT Cygnet.  She was the only ship of her class lost in the war.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBeehler, W. H. (1913).

        "content": "The 2024 Shanghai Diamond League was an outdoor track and field meeting in China. Last held at Shanghai Stadium in 2019, the meeting returned for the first time post-COVID in Suzhou, China, about 100 kilometres (62 mi) away from Shanghai. The meeting was officially known as the Yangtze Delta Athletics Diamond Gala and was the temporary location of the Shanghai Diamond League. It was held on 27 April 2024 at the Suzhou Olympic Sports Centre, and it was the second leg of the 2024 Diamond League – the highest level international track and field circuit. It followed the 2024 Xiamen Diamond League one week prior.\nAt the meeting, Sha'Carri Richardson was upset by Daryll Neita in the women's 200 metres. Selemon Barega won the 5000 metres as expected, but 17-year-old Biniam Mehary surprised to place second.\n\n\n== Results ==\nAthletes competing in the Diamond League disciplines earned extra compensation and points which went towards qualifying for the 2024 Diamond League finals. First place earned 8 points, with each step down in place earning one less point than the previous, until no points are awarded in 9th place or lower. In the case of a tie, each tying athlete earns the full amount of points for the place.\n\n\n=== Diamond Discipline ===\n\n\n=== Promotional Events ===\n\n\n=== National Events ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n2024 Diamond League\n\n\n== References ==\n\nResults\n\"2024 Diamond League Shanghai Results\". worldathletics.org.

        "content": "The Rote–Meto languages are a subgroup of the Austronesian language family spoken in the Lesser Sunda Islands. It includes Meto spoken on Timor and the languages of Rote Island.\n\n\n== Languages ==\nMeto (also called Dawan, Atoni or Timorese) is a cluster of closely related dialects spoken in the Indonesian part of Timor and in the Oecusse district of East Timor. Rote–Meto varieties spoken on Rote Island can be divided into two groups, West Rote and Nuclear (or East) Rote:\n\nWest Rote: Dela-Oenale, Dengka\nNuclear Rote: Ba'a, Bilbaa, Bokai, Keka, Korbafo, Landu, Lole, Oepao, Rikou, Termanu, Tii\n\n\n== Classification ==\nA close relation between Meto and the languages of Rote was proposed in the 20th century by Jonker (1913) and Mills (1991). Edwards (2018a, 2018b, 2021) studied the phonological history of the Rote–Meto languages and reconstructed the ancestral proto-language, Proto-Rote–Meto, based on internal evidence from the Rote–Meto languages, and also from the top-down by tracing the phonological changes that occurred in Rote–Meto reflexes of Proto-Austronesian and Proto-Malayo-Polynesian reconstructions.\nInspite of being located at the opposite geopraphical ends of the Rote–Meto speech area, Meto and West Rote varieties share many common features in their lexicon and historical phonology. This suggests that Proto-Rote–Meto first split into two branches, West Rote-Meto and Nuclear Rote.\n\nSubsequently, Meto came into close contact with Nuclear Rote varieties and underwent some shared innovations with the latter. Most likely, speakers of an early form of the Meto cluster originally lived on Rote Islands in the vicinity of West Rote speakers, but later in history migrated to Timor, where they only remained in contact with speakers of Nuclear Rote varieties.\nOn a higher level, the Rote–Meto languages group with the Austronesian languages spoken to the east. Edwards (2021) includes them in a proposed Timor–Babar subgroup, that comprises all Austronesian languages languages spoken in an area that ranges from Rote Island across Timor and the Barat Daya Islands to Selaru (one of the Tanimbar Islands).\n\n\n== Reconstruction ==\n\n\n=== Comparison table ===\nThis comparison table (a small selection from Edwards (2021:88–403)) illustrates the correspondences between the Rote–Meto languages, including inherited vocabulary as well as Rote–Meto innovations.\n\n\n=== Lexical influence from non-Austronesian langauges ===\nOne third of the basic lexicon reconstructed for Proto-Rote–Meto does not go back to known Austronesian sources. Many of these reconstructed words have sounds that did not occur in the ancestral Proto-Malayo-Polynesian and Proto-Austronesian languages, such as prenasalized stops at the beginning of a word. Most likely, these words were borrowed from a non-Austronesian language spoken by earlier inhabitants of the area.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Barony (or Honour) of Chilham was a feudal barony in Kent, England centered around the village and parish of Chilham.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest record of Chilham is in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is recorded as Cilleham. It takes its name from the old English \"Cyleham\", meaning \"the cold place\".\nIn the time of the ancient Britons, Chilham was likely fortified as a place of strength against the invading Romans, who had several encounters with the Britons in the area. After the Romans gained control of Britain, they strengthened Chilham's fortifications and used it as one of their castra stativa, or permanent military encampments.\nAfter the Romans left Britain, Saxon chieftains maintained control of Chilham and had a fortress or castle on the site of the present Chilham Castle. In the 7th century AD, King Widred of Kent resided at Chilham and strengthened its defenses.\nThe Danes sacked and demolished the castle during raids in either 838 or 851 AD. It remained desolate until the time of the Norman conquest. The lands around Chilham were recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as belonging to Sired de Cilleham, a noble Saxon. After the conquest, the lands were granted by William the Conqueror to his half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux.\nOdo's lands were forfeited to the crown in 1082 after his rebellion against William II. The king then granted Chilham to Fulbert de Dover, from whom it derived the name of the \"Barony of Fobert\", or Fulbert. The barony came to be centered at Chilham Castle, and other manors in the area were dependent on the barony.\nChilham Castle was rebuilt and strengthened after the Norman conquest. It remained an important feudal center, changing hands several times due to inheritance and forfeiture over the following centuries. Owners included the families of Badlesmere, Roos, Scott and Digges.\nIn the 18th century the Colebrooke family came to own Chilham Castle and the barony. In 1775 Robert Colebrooke sold it to Thomas Heron. The Heron family made additions to Chilham Castle before selling the estate to Thomas Wildman in 1792.\n\n\n== Manors ==\nThe Barony of Chilham incorporated several smaller manors:\n\nChilham\nYoungs\nHerst\nEsture\nOld Wives Lees\nDingley\nEnsinge\nShillingheld\nDane\nDenne\nEach manor had its own documented history of feudal landholders, many taking their names from the manor they held. Ownership often followed that of the Barony of Chilham as a whole.\n\n\n== Church of Chilham ==\nThe parish church of St Mary had originally been annexed to the Honour of Chilham. In the 12th century it was separated and granted to the alien priory of Throwley, which was dependent on the abbey of St Bertin in Flanders.\nAfter the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, the church assets were granted to Sir Thomas Chene along with Chilham Castle and the advowson of the vicarage. Subsequent ownership followed that of the barony.\nThe church building is 13th-14th century in origin with 15th-16th century additions and monuments. It housed several chantries and chapels over the centuries.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFeudalism\nLord of the manor\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistory of the Barony",

        "content": "Odense Speedway has consisted of several motorcycle speedway clubs and stadia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origins of speedway in Odense can be traced back to the formation of the Fyns Motor Sport (FMS) in 1924. The club built a dirt track located in Kildemosen, west Odense during 1930. These were the earliest days of speedway in Denmark because the sport had only recently began in Australia before making its way to Great Britain in 1928.\nA rival club, Sportsmotorklubben Odin (SKO) were formed in 1938 and after World War II, the sport gained popularity. The Odense Athletics Stadium began to be used for international meetings from 1950, organised by a collaboration of the FMS and SKO, who effectively merged as one club.\nThe first official Danish Individual Speedway Championship was held at the Athletics Stadium in 1952 and several years later in 1955, the idea of a Danish Tournament for teams surfaced. The Danish Speedway League began in 1956 for Frederiksborg, Amager, Odense and Randers. The Odense team won the first tournament becoming the first champions of Denmark. However, after four editions of the tournament it was agreed by both the FMS and SKO members that the tournament was not a success and they pulled out, with the tournament subsequently ending after 1959.\nThe Athletics stadium hosted rounds of the Speedway World Team Cup in 1960, 1961 and 1965. The track record around the 400 metres track was held by Ove Fundin, a legendary rider within the speedway world.\nThe Danish tournament returned for the 1967 Danish speedway season, this time attracting seven teams, one of which was the FMS/SKO collaboration of Fynborne Odin Odense. The Fangel Speedway track was opened in 1970 by SKO, who had built a 370 metres circuit inside the larger 650 metres Fangel Motorbane and just four years later the Odense Athletics Stadium closed to speedway. On 23 April 1971, the legendary Ole Olsen set the track record at the Fangel Motorbane.\nThe team continued to compete for the majority of the seasons in the tournament at the new Fangel track but suffered poor results, particularly in 1980 and 1981. The team subsequently withdrew from the league and the venue hosted cars and mini speedway on a smaller track until it closed on 16 June 1985.\nThe new professional league was introduced in 1986 and was called the Danish Superliga and the Odense team was unable to take part, having to race at Løvel near Viborg (100 miles from Odense). However, in 1999, a combined Fjelsted/Odense team competed in the Superliga and they managed to win the silver medal during a season beset with problems. The Fjelsted track closed mid-season, resulting in the combined team having to race their remaining fixtures at the Munkebo Speedway Center. Odense, still with no home track raced at the Munkebo again in 2000.\nThe 57-year collaboration between FMS and SKO was dissolved in 2007, with SMO setting up a mini speedway track in the Korsløkke district and FMS setting up a motocross track at Højbjerg.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ancient Turkic-Azerbaijani relations—The preservation of the characteristics of ancient Turkish in the historical and modern stages of the Azerbaijani language, as well as in its dialects. Information provided in \"Divanu Lugat-it-Turk\" (11th century) and Ibn al-Muqaffa's dictionary (13th century) indicates a genetic connection between ancient languages and the Azerbaijani language. In the early stages of the development of literary Azerbaijani language, it maintained the common Turkic characteristics of the Oghuz group, which was understood by both Turkmen and Anatolian Turks.\n\n\n== Language rules and vocabulary ==\nThe presence of an ė sound between e and i in Orkhon monuments (beginning of the 8th century) was explained by bringing evidence from Azerbaijani Turkic: er \"male\" — ër \"early\". However, the e-i change is not always understood because it is mostly written as e in Azerbaijani, and in some cases it is i: bėl, dė. In two words in Azerbaijani, i is seen as a counterpart to e/ė in ancient Turkish: two, twenty. In addition, the suffix -mish, which has been transposed in Azerbaijani Turkish, comes from \"ermiş\" in ancient Turkish.\nIn ancient Turkish, words starting with \"k\" underwent a change to \"g\" in Turkish spoken in Turkey (such as gibi, gönül, göç, göğüs), while in Azerbaijani, they remained the same as in ancient Turkish (köç, könül, köç, köks). Similarly, the shift from \"t\" to \"d\" that occurred during the transition from ancient and medieval Turkish to Western Turkish did not occur in some Azerbaijani words: tikmək (to pull), tökmək (to pour), toxunmaq (to touch).\nThe dialects of the Azerbaijani language are very important in terms of preserving the vocabulary of Turkic languages. This is because these dialects contain many archaic elements belonging to ancient Turkish. Complex words consisting of two words from ancient Turkish (compounds) are also preserved in Azerbaijani language in a lively manner (for example, in the Aghjabadi dialect, the word \"yencih-yencih\" means \"to speak without thinking\"). Compounds in Azerbaijani dialects are encountered in \"Divanu Lugat-it-Turk\" (11th century). The words \"curcur\" (meaning \"waterfall\" in Gabala), \"çırçır\" (in Qazakh), \"şar-şar\" (in Mingachevir), \"şırşır\" (in Goygol, Shusha), and \"şorşor\" (in Qakh, Oguz, Shamkir) in the sense of \"water flowing with noise\" are given in \"Divanu Lugat-it-Turk\" as \"çar çur/çaq çuq/çar çar/şar şar.\"\nIn the dialects of Nakhchivan, some ancient Turkish words that cannot be preserved in Azerbaijani Turkish are present. Among them, words indicating kinship hold a special place. For example, the word \"giyəv/göyüm,\" used in Nakhchivan and Zaqatala dialects to mean \"relative,\" is used in \"Divanu Lugat-it-Turk\" and Ibn al-Muqaffa's dictionary (13th century). This word is also found in Azerbaijani sources such as \"Kitabi-Dede Gorgud\" (13th-15th centuries) and \"Dastani-Ahmad Harami\" (13th century).\nThe inclusion of some words from the Talish language in ancient Turkic writings indicates the antiquity of Azerbaijani-Talish language relations. Additionally, traces of the Khazar language influence can be observed in the northern and northeastern dialects of the Azerbaijani language. Linguists use similarities between Azerbaijani dialects and the Chuvash language in the study and reconstruction of the Khazar language.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe toponym \"Yevlakh\" is derived from ancient Turkish and, according to the Soviet geographer Yevgeniya Pospelova from the 20th century, means \"swamp.\" The toponym \"Kelbajar\" is derived from ancient Turkish \"Kelbicer.\" \"Kelbicer\" means \"fortress on the upper reaches of the river\" (\"kelbi\" - \"upper reaches of the river,\" \"cer\" - \"fortress\").\nAccording to the legend recorded by the 19th-century author I.Linevich, until the 16th century, the city of Qakh was called \"Toragay.\" This word is found in Mahmud al-Kashgari's dictionary \"Divanu Lugat-it-Turk,\" where it means \"refuge among the mountains\" in the language of the Kipchaks. Considering that the city of Qakh is located in a valley between mountains, it can be assumed that the Kipchaks, who came through the Northern Caucasus, settled in Qakh and named it \"Toragay.\"\n\n\n== External links ==\nAzerbaijani terms derived from Proto-Turkic.

        "content": "Lycée Barthelemy Boganda is a public high school situated in Bangui. The school is named after Barthelemy Boganda.\n\n\n== History ==\nLycée Barthelemy Boganda building was constructed on 17 May 1952 and inaugurated on 23 January 1954 by Pierre Chauvet with the name Collège Emil Gentil. In 1968, the school was renamed to Lycée Barthelemy Boganda.\nEcobank Centrafrique donated computers and laboratory equipment worth $11 million to Lycée Barthelemy Boganda on 6 February 2009. The school underwent renovation in 2011, resulting in new classrooms and a rehabilitated sanitary block.\nA quarrel between Lycée Barthelemy Boganda and Lycée Gobongo students outside the school ensued on 1 February 2013, causing traffic disruption on the road in front of the school. The squabble stemmed from some of the Boganda students accusing Gobongo students of not cleaning the courtyard, and some of the Boganda's buildings were leased to Gobongo. The gendarmerie and police arrived at the location and disbursed the fight by firing warning shots and throwing tear gas, leading some students to get injured due to the trampling from the other pupils who fled due to the gunfire. The fight was soon resolved.\nDue to the Seleka takeover of Bangui, Lycée Barthelemy Boganda was temporarily closed and the militias occupied the school. Class learning resumed on 6 May 2013, although fewer students were present. Upon the fall of Seleka Government, an unknown group looted and vandalized the school. In response to this situation, the school principal asked Anti-balaka to guard the school, and they promised to do so.\nThe 3rd-grade students organized a demonstration demanding clarification on the list of candidates for the Baccalaureate Certificate and the removal of the principal, Martin Pounouwaka. Soon, the demonstration ended, and the principal released the candidate lists.\nIn 2018, there was a call to rehabilitate Lycée Barthelemy Boganda as the school was in poor condition which might harm the students and teachers.\nIn April 2019, Lycée Barthelemy Boganda was chosen as the pilot project for Russian language teaching.\nA group of students held a strike by blocking the Independence Avenue road to express their discontent with the teacher shortage in their school on 8 February 2022.\nThe school's basketball court was built with funds from France and was inaugurated on 17 December 2021. BGFIBank Group rehabilitated the laboratory and donated the lab's equipment to the school on 21 September 2023 during the ceremony.\nAs of October 2023, the school was in a dire situation. The school's walls were cracked, whereas the desks, benches, and blackboards were broken. Furthermore, the school classes were dirty, cobwebs were ubiquitous, and windows and doors were lost. Touadéra announced the rehabilitation of the school during his visit to the school on 3 November 2023. In January 2024, the school was renovated.\n\n\n== School life ==\nLycée Barthelemy Boganda has approximately 12,000 students and 155 teachers.\n\n\n== Reputation ==\nThe school is renowned for its excellence and for producing alumni who become national leaders.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nBruno Dacko, Minister of Tourism (2003–2005). \nJean-Jacques Démafouth, Minister of Defense (1999–2001).\nFidèle Gouandjika, Minister of Rural Development and Agriculture (2009–2013) and Minister of Posts and Telecommunications and New Technology (2005–2009).\nPatrice-Edouard Ngaïssona, Minister of Sport (2013) and Leader of Anti-balaka.\nAndré Nzapayeké, Acting Prime Minister of Central African Republic (2014).\nFaustin-Archange Touadéra, 8th President of the Central African Republic (2016–present).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBradshaw, Richard; Rius, Juan Fandos (2016).

The film stars Mohan Agashe, Tejashree Pradhan, Girish Oak, Sameer Dharmadhikari, Shantanu Moghe, Bhargavi Chirmule, Amit Rian.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMohan Agashe as Gajanan Chitre\nTejashree Pradhan as Irawati\nGirish Oak as Prakash\nSameer Dharmadhikari as Yashwant Chitre\nShantanu Moghe as Vishwas Ghadge\nBhargavi Chirmule as Suhasini\nAmit Rian as Sadashiv\nSonal Waghmare as Rohini\nAjita Kulkarni as Uma\nAnkit Mohan as Sridhar\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nSanjay Ghaware of Lokmat rated 3 stars out of 5 stars and  pointing out that while the film \"Lokshahi\" (transl. Democracy) attempts to explore political themes, it becomes entangled in dynastic politics rather than focusing solely on democratic principles. Anub George of The Times of India rated 2.5 stars out of 5 stars and wrote \"A well-shot film that suffers due to bad editing.\" Jaydeep Pathakaji of Maharashtra Times rated 2 stars out of 5 and suggests that the film fails to fully captivate its audience due to these shortcomings. Jyoti Venkatesh of Cine Blitz rated 2 stars out of 5 stars and wrote \"The film, to put it in a nutshell, sets out to shed light on the complexities of navigating political and social landscapes even while addressing a complex theme of social justice and reform.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLokshahi at IMDb",

        "content": "The Special Region of Jakarta Act (Indonesian: Undang-Undang Provinsi Daerah Khusus Jakarta) is a law that declared that Jakarta is no longer capital of Indonesia. With the law enaction, Nusantara is officially Indonesia new capital since 25 April 2024 de jure and Jakarta status as \"Special Capital Region\" revoked. The law turned Jakarta into \"Special Region\" for economic and trading.\nThe bill was passed by nearly all political establishments in the People's Representative Council. Only Prosperous Justice Party rejected the passage of the law.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the passage of State Capital Act 2023, Indonesian government and the People's Representative Council discussed about the future of Jakarta when the capital moved to the Nusantara. On 5 December 2023, the People's Representative Council submitted a bill titled Bill on Special Region of Jakarta. The main contents of the bill was: \n\nAreal delimitation of Jakarta.\nGovernor and Deputy Governor will no longer be electable posts, but rather by presidential appointment.\nSpecial rights of Jakarta in regulating its economy.\nThere will be regencies and cities in future Jakarta, but the regent and mayor posts will be by gubernatorial appointment.\nAs the consequences of formation of new regencies and cities, there will be regency-level and town-level representative council.\nSpecial taxes in Special Region of Jakarta.\nRegarding the governor and deputy governor being presidential appointed posts, PDI-P, Golkar, National Awakening Party, Nasdem, Prosperous Justice Party, Democratic Party, and National Mandate Party objected and disagreed. The government, thru Ministry of Home Affairs, also followed to voice their rejection as being not democratic. \nWhen the law finally passed on 28 April 2024, much of the law content being shifted from its original bill form. The law main contents are:\n\nFormation of Agglomerated Regions Council.\nGovernor and Deputy Governor are still democratically elected posts.\nAllocation of special funds for social and community affairs for districts.\nLimited autonomy for future Jakarta local government.\nCultural development in Jakarta.\nSpecial taxation and tariffs established within Jakarta.\nAgrarian affairs in Jakarta.\n\n\n== Agglomerated Regions Council ==\nArticle 55 of the law mandated the formation of Agglomerated Regions Council (Indonesian: Dewan Kawasan Aglomerasi). The council will regulate the development of Agglomerated Regions of Jakarta, which consisted of Jakarta and its satellites: Bogor Regency, Tangerang Regency, Bekasi Regency, Cianjur Regency, Bogor, Tangerang City, South Tangerang, and Bekasi. The formation of this council is required because prior the formation the council, Jakarta environmental and transportation problems were divided into Jakarta, Bogor, and Bekasi local government. Moreover, different ruling political factions and views between these three local governments make the situation difficult. \nIn the bill, it was mentioned that the Agglomerated Regions Council will be chaired by Vice President of Indonesia ex officio. However, in the law form, the office will be filled by president-appointed official. \n\n\n== Transitional period ==\nDespite by the law Jakarta no longer served as Indonesian capital de jure, until the relevant presidential decree issued, Article 73 of the law stated that the capital remained in Jakarta de facto. Capital movement to Nusantara is expected to be no longer than 16 August 2024.\n\n\n== References ==",

The use of chains was inspired by the aforementioned drama starring Tamamori and proposed by member Kento Senga.\nThe song depicts \"seven people deprived of their freedom and bound together\" and \"the way seven people are connected by a bond\". The members also wear chains in the jacket photo and when they perform the song on TV.\n\n\n== Release ==\nOn November 29, 2017, the CD was sold in three types: limited first-run edition A/B and regular edition. The DVD included in the first edition A contains two music videos for \"Akai Kajitsu,\" while the  first edition B contains footage of the members playing the loose sport of hand soap ball and a preview of their upcoming video work \"LIVE TOUR 2017 Music Colosseum\" to be released the following year. \nThe coupling song \"Future Train\" included in the regular disc is a \"GO! Kiss My Kumamoto Ōita\" commercial song of Kyushu Railway Company. \n\"Hot!x2\" is included as a coupling song for all forms of the album, was used as the commercial song for Kowa (company)'s new hot-air warmer \"Nukunuku Toban\", and the English lyrics are sung to sound like the Japanese \"Quickly Hot Hot\".\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\nAccording to the Billboard Japan Top Singles Sales, the album was No. 1 with sales of 187,000 copies in the first week. It was also No. 1 in the Oricon Weekly Ranking dated December 11, marking their 20th consecutive No. 1 album and tying for fourth place in the history of consecutive No. 1 singles since their debut. This was their 20th consecutive No. 1 album, and tied for the fourth-highest number of consecutive No. 1 singles since their debut. In the same monthly ranking, it was No. 4 in November 2017 and No. 32 in the annual ranking.\nThe number of copies sold in the first week was 184661.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAzusa Ogiwara, the writer of \"Real sound\" which move from a dark world of \"darkness\" and \"fall\" to the hope of \"salvation,\" are effectively expressed by heavy rock-style guitars, low-pitched strings, and short single-note pianos. She also commented that the phrase \"Akai Kajitsu\" that appears at the beginning of the song and after the first chorus accentuates the song and gives it a powerful impression, making it more than just a \"dark\" song. She also commented that She felt a musical quality in the part after the second chorus, which has no lyrics, and that he felt the group's new appeal in that it portrays \"them as characters in a story rather than their life-size, realistic selves.\n\n\n== References ==",

The book rose to first place among the best sellers in Italy in the week from 14 to 20 August.\nIn April 2024, he accepted the candidacy to the European Parliament for the right-wing populist party the League.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Marco Paulo, stage name of João Simão da Silva, is a Portuguese singer and television presenter who was born on 21 January 1945 in Mourão, in the Alentejo region of Portugal. He is one of Portugal's most successful singers ever and also a popular television presenter. Several of his most successful hits in Portugal are properly credited covers of foreign songs which were virtually unknown to the Portuguese public in their original version.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1978, he received the first of many gold discs in his career with the single \"Ninguém, Ninguém\"/\"Canção Proibida\". 1980 saw the release of his biggest hit, \"Eu Tenho Dois Amores\", which, with sales of over 150,000 discs, achieved triple gold, a rare feat in Portuguese music at the time. Other hits in the first half of the 1980s included \"Mais e mais Amor\"/\"Quem Vier Por Bem\" (1981), \"Anita\" (1982), \"Flor Sem Nome\"/\"Cá Se Faz, Cá Se Paga\" (1983) and \"Morena, Morenita\" (1984). In December 1984, Marco Paulo released the album Romance, which included the hits \"Deixa Viver\", \"Nasci Para Cantar\", \"Se Deus Quiser\" and \"Só Falei Para Dizer Que Te Amo\", a version of Stevie Wonder's \"I Just Called To Say I Love You\". This work gave Marco Paulo his first platinum disc. The 1980s also brought success with songs such as \"Dono Do Meu Coração\", \"Joana\", \"Sonho Tropical\", \"Sempre Que Brilha o Sol\", \"Anjo Azul\" and \"Quando o Pai Cantava\". The 1990s opened with the release of De Todo o Coração (1990), from which the singles \"Ai Ai Ai Meu Amor\" and \"Um Amor Em Cada Porto\" were taken. But it would be the following year, with the song \"Taras e Manias\",  a cover of Brazilian singer Elymar Santos's \"Taras e Manias\", that Marco Paulo would once again achieve success, reinforced in the meantime by the compilation Maravilhoso Coração. 1993 marked Marco Paulo's debut as a television presenter, with the program Eu Tenho Dois Amores, a ratings success for two years. That same year he released Amor Total, an album that included songs such as \"Enganas-me e Eu Gosto\", \"Amante, Irmão, Amigo\", \"Perco a Cabeça\", \"Meu Querido Rio\" and \"Coração Deserto\". In 1996, he underwent two operations due to cancer, but returned the following year with Reencontro, an album produced by Emanuel, a singer and songwriter considered one of the greatest icons of so-called Pimba music. His health issues remained anyway a permanent serious problem on his life and career since they firstly arose. In the 2020s, he increasingly started to appear on television programs as an host.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTony Carreira\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Battle of Balasore (Danish; Slaget ved Balasore) was an engagement between Bengali and English ships against Danish ships at Balasore. When the English failed to persuade the Danes, the Bengalis started attacking the English vessel, yet the English were rescued by the Dutch.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1643 Willem Leyel deposed governor Bernt Pessart as overhoved of Danish India. In the preceding year Pessart had declared war on the Mughal Empire. Leyel continued the privateering war against the Mughals as a source of revenue and income.\nIn 1647 the privateer war still waged, and in December that year a noticeable incident was recorded by the English at Balasore.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nThe English at Balasore was given a good reception at Balasore. Yet when a Danish fleet of five ships, including Christianshavn and The Bengali Prize, appeared things suddenly started to change. The Danes had come to settle their long standing grievances and debts against the Mughal authorities by force.\n\n\n=== Confrontation with the Danish ===\nDanes seized one of the Moorish ships with eight elephants at the habour. At the request of Governor Malik Beg, the English twice attmepted to persuade the escaping Danish fleet. When this proved a failure for the English, the Mughals informed the English that they now would have to compensate the damage made by the Danes since both Europeans were Christians.\n\n\n=== Prelude ===\nThe English then tried to escape the habour, yet were blockaded by the Mughals, who placed guns at strategic points and summoned a large force of soldiers. Meanwhile, a letter from the Nawab arrived with a captain and 500 cavalry, demanding to meet the English outside of the town. The English factors refused the demands of the letter.\n\n\n=== Battle ===\nWhen the Nawab heard the English rejection he called c 1.000 soldiers and placed nine guns in strategic positions around the habour. The following day additional guns were planted. The English could not leave the habour and the Budhabalanga River because of a blockade. The Bengalis had already seized 3-4 English boats and 6-8 smaller vessels in the river.\nThings escalated when the Bengalis fired at the British warehouse in Balasore. The English took position with their guns and an insuing confrontation lasted four hours.\nBecause of the blockade, the Dutch East India Company's business was stopped, and was thus fored to join the English course. The Dutch send 60 men and 2 ships to Balasore, which unprovoked the attack on the English.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAt the time of the Battle the Danes had presumably already managed to bring tehmselves and their prize to safety. The war between the Danes and Mughals in Bengal hindered the prospects of trade of the English and Dutch at Balasore.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFirst Anglo-Maratha War – Part of Anglo-Maratha Wars between 1775 and 1818\nCattle War – Conflict between Danish India and the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom\nLoss of the St. Jacob – Seizure of a Danish ship by Benglis\nDano-Mughal War – Danish colonial conflict against the Mughal Empire\nCapture of St. Michael – Capture of Bengali ship by the Danes in 1644\nSkirmish at the Strait of Malacca – Skirmish between Danes and Dutch in Malacca, 1644\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nWellen, Kathryn (2015).

        "content": "The Rōji Kofun (老司古墳)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in Minami-ku, Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2000. \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Rōji Kofun is  a zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above. It is situated on a hill at an elevation of approximately 40 meters on the west bank of the Naka River, orientated to the south. Archaeological excavations were carried out by Kyushu University and the Fukuoka Prefectural Board of Education from 1965 to 1969, and by the Fukuoka City Board of Education in 1987. The tumulus measures 76 meters in total length, with a 45-meter diameter posterior circular portion and 45-meter anterior rectangular width. The mound had fukiishi and cylindrical haniwa. Three stone burial chambers have been confirmed, with two in the posterior portion and one in the anterior portion. Burial chamber No. 1 in the center of the rear circle is the oldest, measuring 2.1 meters in length, 95-cm in width, and 80-cm in height.There is a corridor leading to the front part, and ten bronze mirrors including a triangular-rimmed divine beast mirror, were found as grave goods. From these artifacts, it estimated that the tumulus was built around the beginning of the 5th century. Other grave goods included cylindrical beads and magatama, weapons such as iron swords and iron arrowheads, short armor, horse harnesses, and tools. From the human bones surviving inside the burial chamber, it is known that multiple adult men and women were buried there.. \nThe tumulus is located on the grounds of Fukuoka Juvenile Detention Center and is normally not accessible to the public.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFukuoka City home page(in Japanese)",

        "content": "Nokata Site (野方遺跡, Nokata iseki) is an archeological site with a late Yayoi period to early Kofun period settlement located in Nishi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. It was designated as a National Historic Site in 1975. \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Nokata Site is located on an alluvial fan at an elevation of 17 to 22 meters at the eastern foot of Mount Kano in the northeastern part of the Sefuri Mountains, on the western edge of the Sawara Plain. It is thought to have been a key transportation point, located between the current Itoshima area, which is presumed to be the location of the ancient kingdom of Itokoku, and the area around present-day Kasuga which is presumed to be the location of ancient kingdom of Nakoku, which are mentioned in ancient Chinese texts, such as the Wajinden.\nThe site was discovered by high school students during the construction of the Nokatadai housing complex in 1973, and an archaeological excavation was carried out from August of the same year. The remains include a large oval ring moat with a long axis of about 100 meters, enclosing a smaller rectangular moat measuring about 25 to 30 meters on each side. The large ring moat had about ten pit dwellings built inside, and the smaller moat, with an entrance and exit on the east side appeared to contain raised-floor warehouses to store grain, etc.  Yayoi pottery, stone tools, iron tools, shellfish, fish bones, and animal bones have been unearthed. In the early part of the Kofun period, the large and small ring moats seemed to have been filled in, but at least 94 pit dwellings were built and a large village which extended beyond the site of the moats existed. At the outskirts of the village, there were cemeteries with three jar burial graves, one earthen pit grave, and one wooden coffin grave, and ten stone box-style sarcophagus graves. If unexplored parts are included, the number of remains is expected to be several times that number. Grave goods from these Kofun period burials included Chinese-made beast-belt bronze mirrors, mirrors with inner flower patterns, iron swords, cylindrical beads, and glass beads have been unearthed as grave goods from this period. \nAfter the excavation was completed in 1989, the site was backfilled, and preserved as Nokata Central Park.  In addition to the restoration of a portion of the ring moat, the Nokata Ruins Dwelling Ruins Exhibition Hall (野方遺跡住居跡展示館) was constructed to display building ruins and some of the excavated artifacts. In addition, two restorations of pit buildings were constructed in the park, but were destroyed in a suspicious fire in May 1994 and have not been rebuilt. \nThe site is approximately a 3.3 kilometers south of Shimoyamato Station on the JR Kyushu Chikuhi Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFukuoka city home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "The Ikisan Chōshizuka Kofun (一貴山銚子塚古墳)  is a Kofun period burial mound, located in the  Nijo-Tanaka neighborhood of the city of Itoshima, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. The tumulus was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1957. It is the largest kofun on the Genkai Sea coast.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Chōshizuka Kofun is  a zenpō-kōen-fun (前方後円墳), which is shaped like a keyhole, having one square end and one circular end, when viewed from above. It is situated on a hill overlooking Karatsu Bay on the west bank near the mouth of the Nagano River that flows north. It has a total length of 103 meters, although it has somewhat lost its original shape. The posterior circular portion is estimated to have a diameter of 60 meters, and the width of the rectangular anterior portion is 31 meters, narrowing to 26 meters at the neck. The tumulus has no traces of fukiishi nor haniwa, and it is uncertain if it originally had a surrounding moat. In an 1950 archaeological excavation, it was discovered that a pit-style stone burial chamber remained in the rear circle, made of granite cobbles, with a length of 3.4 meters, width of 1.4 meters and height of 0.8 meters. The upper part was covered with basalt slabs and the floor was paved with stones. It was orientated diagonally to the main axis of the tumulus. Grave goods included ten bronze mirrors, magatama beads, cylindrical beads, iron swords, spears, and arrowheads. One of the square-shaped four divine mirrors and one mirror with inner flower patterns are placed near the head of the coffin, and date from the middle to late Han Dynasty.  The four triangular-rimmed divine and beast mirrors were made in Japan and were placed on the left and right side edges. Currently, most of the excavated items are stored at the Kyoto University Museum. From the style of the tumulus and the grave goods, it is estimated that this tumulus was constructed in the later 4th century.  \nThe tumulus is located approximately 450 meter northeast of Ikisan Station on the JR Kyushu Chikuhi Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Ikisan Choshizuka Kofun at Wikimedia Commons\n\nItoshima Tourist Information (in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web (in Japanese)",

        "content": "The 1987 Melbourne Cup was a handicap horse race which took place on Tuesday, 3 November 1987 over 3200m, at Flemington Racecourse for a stake of $1,285,000.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe race was won by the New Zealand bred gelding Kensei, trained by Les Bridge and ridden by Larry Olsen.  The runner up was the big Kiwi mare Empire Rose trained by Laurie Laxon, and third place went to Rosedale trained by Bart Cummings. The winning margin was a half length with a further short half head to third place.\nKensei was bred in New Zealand by D F Duffy & G S Hale.  He was sired by Blarney Kiss (USA), who was also the sire of 1983 Melbourne Cup winner Kiwi. His dam was Kitty's Dream (NZ) who was by Nauplius (NZ).\nKensei had previously won a 1800m welter race at Randwick in September, then ran second to The Brotherhood in the Group 2 Newcastle Gold Cup (2300m) and second to Balciano in the Group 1 Metropolitan (2600m) at Randwick.  Earlier, in July, he had won the 1987 Grafton Cup over 2200m.  He had not previously raced over 3200m   Kensei returned to contest the 1988 Cup but was placed 10th.\nThe runner up Empire Rose had finished 5th in the 1986 Melbourne Cup behind At Talaq.  Eleven days later she won the New Zealand Cup at Riccarton and the following year she won the Mackinnon Stakes and 1988 Melbourne Cup.\nKensei's victory was the only Melbourne Cup win for his jockey Larry Olsen or trainer Les Bridge.\n\n\n=== First woman jockey in the Melbourne Cup ===\nMaree Lyndon from New Zealand became the first woman to ride in the Melbourne Cup.  Maree was 24 years of age and she finished 20th on Argonaut Style, trained by Tony Cole. In May 1987 she had won the Randwick St Leger (2800m) on Argonaut Style. She later recounted that unlike many other occasions as a pioneering woman jockey she did not have to change in a storage room or tent. A section of the jockeys’ room was sliced off for her to change. \nAs well as being the first to ride in the Melbourne Cup she was also the first woman to win:\n\na New Zealand Group 1, notably the New Zealand Cup (3200m) on Sirtain for Max Northcott, New Plymouth in 1982.\nthe Adelaide Cup, on Lord Reims in 1987.\nthe Auckland Cup on Miss Stanima for Murray Baker, Woodville in 1990.\nIt took until 2003 for the first Australian female jockey to ride in the Cup. Clare Lindop rode Debben for Leon Macdonald, finishing 19th behind Makybe Diva.  The first woman jockey to win the race was Michelle Payne on Prince Of Penzance in the 2015 Melbourne Cup.\n\n\n== Field ==\nThe following are the placegetters in the 1987 Melbourne Cup.\n\n\n== References ==",

The computer is expected to be initially used by Nvidia for research and development purposes and for collaborations with the industry, and later will be available as part of Nvidia's supercomputing service in the cloud, NVIDIA DGX Cloud, so that other organizations and entities can use it.\nThe first phase of the computer began operating in November 2023, and completion of its construction is expected in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\n== Features ==\nIn the first phase, the computer includes 128 Dell PowerEdge XE9680 systems (from the Dell PowerEdge server line), in which 1,024 NVIDIA HGX H100 80GB graphics processors, more than 40 Nvidia Spectrum-4 ethernet switches and 1,280 NVIDIA chips BlueField-3 and SuperNIC developed in the development center of Nvidia in Israel. This vehicle provides performance of 4 exa-flops (‎4×1018‎) for artificial intelligence applications and 65 peta-flops (‎65×1015‎) for scientific applications.\nIn the second and final stage, the computer will contain exactly double the amount of what it contains in the first stage: 256 Dell PowerEdge XE9680 systems, with more than 34 million CUDA cores and one million Tensor cores of the fourth generation. 256 XE9680 systems will contain a total of 2,560 NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU and SuperNIC chips, and over 80 Spectrum-4 Ethernet switches. This vehicle will provide performance of 8 exa-flops (‎8×1018‎) for artificial intelligence applications and 130 peta-flops (‎130×1015‎) for scientific applications.",

        "content": "Natalia Chueca Muñoz (born 1976) is a Spanish People's Party (PP) politician. She has been a member of the city council in Zaragoza since 2019 and mayor since 2023.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Zaragoza, Chueca is married and has three children as of 2023. She graduated in business administration and management from the University of Zaragoza in 1998 and earned a Master of Business Administration from the EADA Business School in Barcelona. She worked in marketing as well as giving classes for the MBA course at ESIC University. She was director of marketing for the Zaragoza-based toy retailers Imaginarium SA.\nChueca was placed sixth on the People's Party (PP) list headed by Jorge Azcón for the 2019 Zaragoza City Council election; she was the second highest candidate on the list to not have previous political experience. She was made councillor in charge of public services and mobility in Azcón's administration.\nIn January 2023, Azcón, in his role as leader of the People's Party of Aragon, named Chueca as his successor as candidate for mayor in the city council election. She ran on a platform including improving relationships between residents and institutions, increasing social support, improving public transport and infrastructure, and rebuilding La Romareda stadium for the 2030 FIFA World Cup. The PP rose by seven seats to 15 out of 31, and she was invested as mayor; all three provincial capitals of Aragon, the others being Huesca and Teruel, had PP women mayors. In September 2023, she was chosen by national PP leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo as spokeswoman of the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces (FEMP).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Frederikshavn Speedway or Sæby Speedway Klub is a motorcycle speedway club from Denmark, who competed in the Danish Speedway League from 1974 to until 1994.\n\n\n== Track ==\nThe home venue of the club was the Ørnedalen track (390 metres in circumference), which was located approximately 15 kilometres south of Frederikshavn and 3 kilometres west of Sæby on the Vandløsvej 29 (57°19′44″N 10°28′15″E).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Frederikshavn Motor Sports club (FrMS) was founded in 1937 and in 1950 they opened a speedway track at the Frederikshavn Stadium. However, in 1956, the club relocated to a purpose-built facility built near Sæby and the motor sports center grew in size over the following decades. The speedway track was known as Ørnedalen opened on 10 June 1956 and later in 1979, a moto cross circuit was opened.\nThe speedway team began participation in the Danish tournament (league) during the 1974 Danish speedway season, racing as Rødspætterne (the Plaice) because of the industry connected to the town. Rødspætterne won the second division in 1979 and gained promotion, which led to the creation of a second team Hajerne (the Sharks) in 1980.\nRødspætterne won the bronze medal during the 1981 Danish speedway season and the two teams continued to compete until 1986. The new professional league was introduced in 1986 and was called the Danish Superliga. The Frederikshavn speedway team, as they were now known, were not selected as founder members of the top division in 1986 but did race in the 1987 Superliga and won the silver medal in 1988.\nIn 1990, the speedway section split from the Frederikshavn Motor Sports club and became the Sæby Speedway Klub. The same season the team won the bronze medal but then struggled financially to compete in the Superliga and withdrew from the Danish league system at the end of 1994.\nIn 2022, the Sæby Speedway Klub returned to Frederikshavn for the first time in nearly 40 years, when they held an ice speedway meeting in the Iscenter Nord.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Western Azerbaijan Society- is an organization created to unite the Azerbaijani people and their descendants who were forcibly deported en masse from present-day Armenia, with the aim of fostering social and cultural unity.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe \"Western Azerbaijan Society\" is the legal successor of the \"Azerbaijan Refugee Society,\" which has been active since 1989. The decision to transform the society into a non-commercial organization under the name \"Western Azerbaijan Society\" was approved during the general assembly of the society held on August 3, 2022. The leader of the organization is Aziz Alekberli, a deputy of the National Assembly.\n\n\n=== Scientific activity ===\nDiscussions have been held within the framework of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences regarding the development of mutual scientific relations. During the meeting of the Coordination Council for Research on Western Azerbaijan, discussions were held.\n\n\n=== Commissioning of the community building ===\nSince August 2022, the \"Western Azerbaijan Society\" has been operating in the building located at 9 G. Gadirbeyov Street, Narimanov District, which was formerly occupied by the Shusha District Executive Authority and the organization \"Return to Karabakh\" (formerly known as the Society of Azerbaijanis of Mountainous Karabakh).\nOn December 24, 2022, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev visited the administrative building of the Western Azerbaijan Society and acquainted himself with the conditions created there. He also held a meeting with a group of visitors from Western Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== Ideology and structure ==\n\n\n=== Ideology ===\nThe purpose of the society is to achieve the social and cultural unity of Azerbaijani individuals and their descendants who have been forcibly deported en masse from Armenian territory at various times due to their ethnic identity. This includes the restoration of their rights on an international level, the study and promotion of the rich historical and cultural heritage created by the Azerbaijani people in Armenian territory, preventing its destruction, ensuring the right of those individuals to return to their ancestral homeland, and facilitating coexistence. To fulfill these purposes, the society's responsibilities and rights have been determined.\n\n\n=== Structure ===\nThe society consists of Observation, Elders, Visitors, Women, and Custodian Councils (with Mürvet Həsənli serving as the President of the Custodian Council), as well as the executive committee, Supervisory-Inspection Commission, Youth Union, and representations in foreign countries. On January 8, 2023, an Elm Commission (Science Commission) was established within the Western Azerbaijan Society.\nRepresentative offices have been established within the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Ganja, Sumqayit, and Goranboy-Naftalan. Additionally, a representative office has been established in the Netherlands.\n\n\n== International communications ==\nOn October 6, 2023, a representative of the Western Azerbaijan Society, Kamal Jafarov, held meetings in Geneva with responsible individuals from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Executive Committee, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the \"Geneva Geostrategy Observatory.\" Discussions focused on the issues of Azerbaijani returnees to Armenia and their reintegration.\nOn October 23, 2023, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, Dunja Mijatović, met with the leadership of the Western Azerbaijan Society and Azerbaijani members of the society. The discussion revolved around the issue of Azerbaijani returnees to Armenia. Mijatović emphasized the need for political will regarding the return issue and expressed her commitment to working within her mandate on these matters.\nOn December 5, 2023, the President of the Western Azerbaijan Society, Aziz Alekberli, met with the Deputy Chairman of Turkey's ruling party (AK Party) and Member of the Turkish Parliament, Zafar Sırakaya. The meeting involved an exchange of ideas on bilateral relations, and the issue of Azerbaijani returnees to Armenia was discussed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAzerbaijani Community of Nagorno-Karabakh\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Koragajja, also formally referred to as Koragathaniya, is a spirit deity (Daiva) worshipped throughout Tulunadu, Malenadu, and Kasaragod. These are regions located in coastal South-West India within the states of Karnataka and Kerala. He is one of the most widely revered spirits in the Tulu folklore pantheon, and is often worshipped through a shamanic dance known as Būta Kōlā or a private ceremony called Būta Nēma.\n\n\n== Personality ==\n\nKoragajja is highly respected for his intelligence and wisdom. His devotees approach him for his fair guidance in resolving disputes and making important decisions. He is also a guardian figure who provides protection to his devotees from evil spirits and negative influence, and he is thus turned to for safety and security especially in matters regarding spiritual and physical wellbeing.\nA major distinctive aspect that defines Koragajja is his  approachability. While many deities are portrayed as distant or reserved, Koragajja is approachable and is directly involved in everyday matters of his devotees.\nKoragajja is believed to have been a historical figure who resided in Tulunadu. It was due to his virtuous life and miraculous events associated with him that he became venerated as a spirit.\n\n\n== Role ==\nKoragajja is often depicted as a figure with a deep connection to the legal and moral order of the community. He is known for his ability to offer insightful judgments in disputes, guide the community in difficult times, and protect his followers from harm. He is typically portrayed carrying a sword and a pan (sometimes considered as a book or palm leaf manuscript), symbols of his authority and knowledge.\nKoragajja's story is not just about his divine actions but also about his impact on Tulu culture. He embodies the ethical and moral values of the community, serving as a link between the past and the present, the spiritual and the everyday. His tale is a vital part of the collective memory and identity of the Tulu-speaking people, reflecting their beliefs, values, and the complexities of their social life.",

        "content": "Ivan Nikolayevich Kudryavtsev (Russian: Иван Николаевич Кудрявцев; 13 April 1904 — 13 August 1995) was a Soviet and Finnish architect, architectural historian, and teacher. He was a representative of the Kudryavtsev dynasty of architects.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nKudrjavzev was born in St. Petersburg into the family of the hereditary architect Nikolai Galaktionovich Kudryavtsev, builder of the Kazan Cathedral in the city of Luga. The family retained Finnish citizenship.\nIn 1923, Kudrjavzev graduated from school in Petrograd and entered the Architectural Institute (later included in the Academy of Arts).\nIn February 1928, Kudrjavzev was awarded the title of architect for his graduation project for the building of the Academy of Arts and the Art and Industrial College.\nIn 1930, Kudrjavzev began working at the newly created Architectural College in Leningrad, where for five years he taught a course in the history of architecture and taught architectural design.\nIn 1931 Kudrjavzev was arrested without charges, and after his release six months later he returned to the design workshop of the People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs of the USSR, which was designing buildings for telephone exchanges, post offices and houses of culture for communication workers. Kudrjavzev was the author of the projects for the buildings of the Krasnoarmeyskaya and Vasileostrovskaya ATS, residential buildings at the Vyborg ATS in Leningrad, the Communications House in Petrozavodsk, the telephone directorate house, and the competition project for the air terminal. The architecture of Kudrjavzev's buildings was characteristic of the 1930s as an example of Art Deco - a kind of symbiosis of constructivist methods and shaping techniques, definitely associated with the classical tradition.\nIn 1938, Kudrjavzev was expelled from Leningrad to Finland as a citizen of that country, where he settled in Helsinki. Having mastered Swedish, he entered the service of the Paul Buman company as a draftsman, which was engaged in engineering equipment, interior design, and furnishing.\nDuring the Continuation War, Kudrjavzev was at the front in the Finnish troops, and after the end of hostilities he continued to work at the Paul Buman company. In 1961 he was appointed its director and worked in this position until 1979. He went on several business trips abroad, including to the Soviet Union.\nKudrjavzev devoted a lot of time to the maintenance of a Russian nursing home, and from 1967, he headed the Russian Charitable Society in Finland.\nKudrjavzev donated his archive to the Slavic collection “Slavica” of the University of Helsinki library.\nKudrjavzev died on 13 August 1995 in Helsinki and was buried in the Orthodox section of the cemetery in the Lapinlahti area.\n\n\n== Work ==\nOne of the main components of Kudrjavzev's creative activity in Finland was the design (on a voluntary basis) and construction of Orthodox churches. He designed the Elias Church at the Orthodox cemetery in Helsinki (1951–1953), the Transfiguration Cathedral of the New Valamo Monastery in Heinävesi (1975–1977), and the temple in the city of Järvenpää (1979–1980).\nIn 1965, Kudrjavzev developed a sketch of an Orthodox church in Stockholm, but the project was not implemented. The architecture of his temples is characterized by a neo-Russian style, based on the images of the ancient architecture of Novgorod and Pskov. The Cathedral of the New Valamo Monastery became the prototype of the Orthodox Church in Brick Township (1998, New Jersey, USA, architect B. Bennett).\nKudrjavzev supervised the reconstruction and repairs of the St. Nicholas Church of the St. Nicholas Orthodox community and the house of the Russian Charitable Society in Helsinki. He designed iconostases and church utensils. He collaborated with Russian artists: images for the Ilyinskaya Church were created by artists of the Icon society. The interior of the temple in Järvenpää was painted by Yuri Mitroshin. The sculptor-ceramist Michael Schilkin participated in the decoration of the facades of the Elias Church.\n\n\n== Family ==\nGreat-grandfather — Andrei Mineyevich Kudryavtsev (1768–1865), a carpenter, originally from the village of Nikolo-Zalesya, Soligalichsky district, Kostroma province. He took on contracts in St. Petersburg, participating in the construction of the Kazan Cathedral.\nGrandfather — Galaktion Andreyevich Kudryavtsev (1802–1867), construction contractor assigned to the city of Vilmanstrand, subject of the Grand Duchy of Finland; took large orders for construction in St. Petersburg and Old Finland (Vyborg province). In St. Petersburg, he built the Church of St. Mitrophan of Voronezh at the Mitrofaniyevsky Cemetery (architect Konstantin Thon), in which an independent chapel was built at the expense of the Kudryavtsev family (1858).\nGrandmother — Yevgenia Trifonovna Kudryavtseva (? — 1907), buried in the family crypt near Luga.\nUncle — Sergei Galaktionovich Kudryavtsev, architect.\nFather — Nikolai Galaktionovich Kudryavtsev (2 February 1856—19 July 1941), architect, designer of many residential and industrial buildings in St. Petersburg, as well as the Kazan Cathedral in Luga, the Holy Trinity Church on his own estate near Luga, the parish building schools in the Cheremenets Monastery. He was buried in Helsinki in an Orthodox cemetery in the Lapinlahti area.\nBrother — Andrei Nikolaevich Kudryavtsev (30 May 1901—10 January 1985), architect, priest, rector of the Church of the Intercession in Helsinki. He graduated from the correspondence construction institute, but was not allowed to defend his diploma due to foreign citizenship. In 1936 he went to Finland, where he worked as a factory worker and later as a design engineer. At retirement age he was ordained to the priesthood.\nBrother — Mikhail Nikolaevich Kudryavtsev. He was the only one in the family to accept Soviet citizenship in the 1920s.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Itazuke Site (板付遺跡, Itazuke iseki) is an archeological site with a late Jōmon period to late Yayoi period settlement located in Hakata-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.  Along with the Nabatake Site in Karatsu, Saga, it is the oldest known rice-growing village site in Japan, and is also the oldest known moated settlement. It was designated as a National Historic Site in 1976, with the area under protection expanded in several times.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Itazuke Site consists of the remains of a moated village located almost in the center of the Fukuoka plain on a plateau at an elevation of 7 to 9 meters on the west bank of the Mikasa River. The site was discovered in 1916, when several tombs from the end of the early to middle Yayoi period containing three bronze swords and three bronze halberds were  discovered. Archaeological excavations have been carried out at the site almost continuously since 1951.\nThe traces of rice paddies and a cemetery spread over the surrounding alluvial land. The village ruins, which have an egg-shaped moat with a long diameter of 110 meters and width of up to five meters, include pit dwellings, storage holes, and wells. Remains of paddy fields from the late Jōmon period have been discovered, challenging the prevailing theory that wet rice cultivation was introduced into Japan only from the Yayoi period.  Irrigation facilities such as a weir built in an irrigation canal were also found. Based on the spacing between the ridges, each section of rice field is about 400 meters, and based on the chronology of excavated Yayoi pottery, it dates from the very beginning of the Yayoi culture. In addition, bronze spears and swords were unearthed from a tomb at the site mark the first time that Yayoi pottery was accompanied by metal utensils. A bronze spear mold were also unearthed, although almost all bronze weapons which appear as grave goods from this period were believed to have been imported from the Korean Peninsula.  The site also yielded pre-Yayoi pottery, human footprints, carbonized rice, stone knives, and wooden tools.\nThe site has been preserved as an archaeological park with re-creations of pit-style dwellings and rice fields and a museum. The site is approximately 2.1 kilometers east of Takeshita Station on the JR Kyushu Kagoshima Main Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Itazuke Site at Wikimedia Commons\n\nFukuoka city home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)\nFukuoka City Museum(in Japanese)\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka Prefecture(in Japanese)",

        "content": "The Horikawa Canal (堀川用水, Horijkawa Yosui)  is an Edo period agricultural irrigation canal, located on the Chikugo River in the city of Asakura, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. Together with the Asakura Waterwheel pumping system, it was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1979. It irrigates a total of 664 hectares of paddy fields..\n\n\n== Horikawa Canal ==\nConstruction of the Horikawa Canal began in 1663 in the early Edo period by Fukuoka Domain and it was completed the following year. The main canal has a length of 11 kilometers, and branch canals extend for another 77 kilometers. The current water intake is the Yamada Weir. The canal has a branch point in the middle of the main line. The northern half of the main line was the original Horikawa Canal, and the southern half was completed in 1764, and was referred to as the \"New Horikawa Canal\".  \nUnder the Tokugawa shogunate, each feudal domain began implementing policies to promote new rice field development in order to improve their financial situation. In the early Edo period, the Asakura area suffered from frequent drought and locust damage alternative with flooding of the Chikugo River, but with the construction of the Horikawa Canal, this area became a grain-producing area and source of revenue for the Fukuoka Domain.  \nHowever, due to the accumulation of earth and sand at the intake, the intake was moved in 1722. A tunnel with a length of 11 meters was cut out with a chisel into the bedrock on the right bank of the Chikugo River next to the current Yamada Weir, and was called Kirinuki Suimon. In 1759, the amount of water from the Horikawa Canal became insufficient due to the excessive expansion of new rice fields, and water was not longer available to the rice fields downstream. It was decided that the width of the irrigation canal should be widened and the main canal extended. Construction work was finally completed in 1764.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Asakura Waterwheels ==\nThe Asakura water wheels have been in operation for over 200 years, and are the oldest operating water wheels in Japan.  After the Horikawa Canal was completed in 1663 in response to a famine caused by drought, a water gate was cut out of the bedrock in 1790 and the Yamada Weir was constructed to dam the water to expand the irrigated area. However, since the land near the upper reaches of the Horikawa Canal is at a slightly higher elevation, it was not possible to use the water from the Horikawa Canal directly, so a series of self-rotating water wheels were constructed. A rapid stream from the outlet of the weir powers the water wheels, which are equipped with buckets to pump up the water to higher elevations. \nThe pumping systems were constructed in four locations and are known to be in operating from 1759, and three of the systems (the Hishino Suisha, Mishima Suisha, and Hisashige Suisha, named after the hamlets where they are located), remain in use. Of these, the Hishino Suisa, which was completed in 1789, is a triple wheel system, and the other two are double wheel systems. The Hishino Suisha can pump 6100 liters of water per minute. The water is then sent to a higher location by a siphon buried underground. The irrigated area is approximately 35 hectares in total, and the operating period is from June 17 to mid-October every year, which overlaps with the rice planting period  The waterwheels are rebuilt every five years by local craftsmen, and the original techniques have been passed down.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Horikawa Aqueduct at Wikimedia Commons\n\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka Prefecture\nAsakura city home page (in Japanese)",

        "content": "IC 4040 is a type SABc spiral galaxy with a bar in Coma Berenices. It is located 353 million light-years away from the solar system and has an estimated diameter of 105,000 thousand light-years making it slightly larger than the Milky Way. IC 4040 was discovered on April 12, 1891, by Guillaume Bigourdan and is a member of the Coma Cluster.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIC 4040 is considered a jellyfish galaxy due to its close proximity to the cluster where gas is stripped from the galaxy by the action of ram pressure.  A radio continuum tail can seen extending outwards from the galaxy, showing widespread occurrence of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields which is being removed by pressure. The stripped electrons are re-accelerated by turbulence and ICM shocks or by new supernovae, since massive stars can be found in H II regions that are located in its ram pressure stripped tail.\nAccording to studies, extended ionized gas can be found surrounding IC 4040. This shows increased radial velocities which reaches up between 400 and 800 kilometer per seconds within distance from the nucleus of the galaxy. Not to mention, a low velocity filament is found at the southeastern edge of IC 4040 which exhibits blue continuum and strong Hα emission. The widths exceeds 200 Å and much more compared to 1000 Å for some knots, indicating the intensive activity of star formation. Some of these filaments show signs of shock emission-line spectra suggesting shock heating plays an important function in excitation and ionization of extended ionized gas.  IC 4040 also presents a strong radio source compared to galaxies of type E/SO.\n\n\n== Supernovae ==\nTwo supernovae have been discovered in IC 4040 so far: PTF11gdh in 2011 and SN 2022jo in 2022.\n\n\n==== PTF11gdh ====\nPTF11gdh was discovered on June 21, 2011, in IC 4040 by Palomar Transient Factory. The supernova was located 0\" east and 0\" south of the nucleus. The supernova was Type la.\n\n\n==== SN 2022jo ====\nSN 2022jo was discovered in IC 4040 on January 9, 2022, by a group of astronomers; Chunpeng Bi, Jianlin Xu, Mi Zhang, Jingyuan Zhao, Guoyou Sun, Jiangao Ruan and Wenjie Zhou from Xingming Observatory. SN 2022jo was found at Right Ascension (13hr 00min 37s .666) and Declination (+28 degrees 0.3' 25\".71). It was located 0\".0 east and 0\".0 north of the nucleus. The supernova was Type II.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Shinmachi Dolmen Cluster (新町支石墓群)  is an archaeological site with a  Yayoi period cemetery containing numerous dolmens, located in the city of Itoshima, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2000.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Shinmachi Dolmen Cluster is located on the southwest side of the Itoshima Peninsula facing the Genkai Sea, on a sand dune facing Hikizu Bay. This site has been known since the early twentieth century, but a full-scale archaeological excavation was carried out until 1986. The site is a complex one, including shell middens from the late Jōmon period, the Mitoko Matsubara settlement ruins from the Yayoi Period where coins have  been found, and box-style sarcophagus graves from the early Kofun period. The National Historic Site designation covers a cluster of dolmens and wooden coffin graves in a cemetery from the early Yayoi Period.  As a result of several range confirmation surveys, the known extent of the grave area has expanded, and at the foot of the sand dunes on the south side, it extends for about 80 meters north–south and about 140 meters east–west. A total of 57 dolmens and grave sites were identified, including seven dolmens with the upper stone in its original position and ten dolmens without the upper stone. Approximately one-third of the 57 graves were dolmens. Similar dolmens have been found in the Korean Peninsula. About half of the graves were excavated, and half of these contained small pots. In addition, a total of 14 sets of human bones were excavated, and it appears that infants were buried in jar coffins and adults in wooden coffins. The human bones showed characteristics typical of the Jōmon people, such as a short face and short stature, and Jōmon-style tooth extraction was commonly observed.\nTwo tombs, No. 9 and No. 11, which have almost the same structure and size, have been completely excavated. Tomb No. 9 has a granite upper stone weighing approximately one ton supported by four dolmens, and the grave shaft is rectangular with a length of 180-cm, a width of 65-cm, and a depth of 60-cm. A human skeleton was discovered with knees in a slightly bent position. Judging from this burial posture and the presence of stones on all sides of the bottom of the earthen pit, which are believed to be coffin stands, it is thought that a wooden coffin was used to bury the remains.\nIn Tomb No. 24, the human remains of a middle-aged man were discovered with a Korean willow leaf-shaped polished stone arrowhead stuck in his left femur, sandwiched between four stones that appeared to be the backfill of a wooden coffin. It is speculated that he died in a battle during the early Yayoi period, and the find was widely described in popular media as the \"first casualty of war in the Japanese archipelago\". Directly below these remains was a small earthen pit in which the head of another person (only the teeth were found) was buried. It is further speculated that this was the head of the person killed by the man in battle. Currently, a roof has been placed over this tomb, and the adjacent Shinmachi Ruins Exhibition Hall  (新町遺跡展示館) displays some of the opened graves in situ as well as artifacts found at the site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCultural Properties in Fukuoka Prefecture(in Japanese)\nItoshima home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "The International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action was designed in 2005 by the United Nations General Assembly to raise awareness and seek assistance for mine action is observed every year on April 4. This day aims to highlight the dangers of land mines and explosive remnants of war, as well as to promote efforts to clear contaminated areas and assist victims. It underscores the importance of mine action in saving lives, protecting civilians, and enabling development in affected areas. The day also serves as a reminder of the international community's commitment to addressing the threats posed by land mines and supporting mine action initiatives worldwide.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the day on December 8, 2005. The decision was made to raise public attention towards mine action activities, the threats posed by land mines, and how to work towards their elimination. The day was first observed on April 4, 2006.\nOver the past almost 20 years, the United Nations Mine Action Service’s (UNMAS) work has encouraged the needs of affected individuals and adapted to the threat of risks faced by humanitarians. The service calls for the continuation of certain initiatives that promote the expansion of national-mine action capacity in areas where mines and explosives pose a threat to civilians’ lives.\nThe day is significant as it marks the establishment of the UN’s accountability framework and the introduction to the UN's Theory of Change in mine action program. The day also aids peacekeepers to carry out patrols, help humanitarians, raise awareness against mines among people living in dangerous atmospheres and educate them how to survive fearlessly and not worry about compromising their lives.\nThe International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action seeks to achieve a world free of land mines and explosive remnants of war. This is to help individuals and communities to survive in a safe environment where the victim's needs are taken care of.\n\n\n== The threat of mines ==\nMines, explosive remnants of war, and improvised explosive devices (IED) continue to cause death and injury, especially in situations of armed conflict. On average, one person is killed or injured every hour. Many children are among the victims. The use of improvised explosive devices has expanded, terrorizing civilians and threatening humanitarian and peacekeeping missions and personnel.\n\n\n== Focus of  2024 Commemorations ==\nThe 2024 commemoration of the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action focuses on disabled survivors of explosive hazards, and all people with disabilities living through conflicts. The United Nations has called for a greater responsiveness to the needs and rights of all people with disabilities in conflict and peacebuilding settings.\nThe 2024 campaign will bring attention to the five-year anniversary of Security Council resolution 2475, which calls upon Member States, and specifically Security Council members, to consider and protect persons with disabilities; to ensure they have access to assistance, and to include them in conflict prevention and peacebuilding.\n\n\n== Events and activities ==\nVarious events and activities are organized to mark this day. In 2024, the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) opened a multi-media exhibition themed “Witnessing a Way Forward: Protecting Lives. Building Peace. The exhibition highlighted the need for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 2475 (2019), which calls on all Member States and Council members to take into account the needs of persons with disabilities in conflict situations.\n\n\n== Towards a mine-free world: the path forward ==\nThe International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action serves as a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by mines and other explosive remnants of war. It is a call to action for the international community to work together to eliminate these threats and to ensure the safety and well-being of all people, particularly those living in conflict-affected areas.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Karain: A Memory\" is a short story by the Polish-British author Joseph Conrad, first published in Blackwood's Magazine in 1897. It was later included in his 1898 collection Tales of Unrest.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe story was Conrad's first story commissioned for Blackwood's Magazine, popularly known as the Maga. It was based on the Polish folktale \"Czaty\" by Adam Mickiewicz.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story is told through a double frame narrative. An unnamed narrator encounters Karain, a haunted Malay chief, on a schooner. Karain recounts his past in the form of a story. The narrative centres on Karain's loyalty to his friend Pata Matara, who seeks to restore his family's honour by killing his sister, who eloped with a Dutch trader. Karain and Matara travel for many years, during which Karain is haunted by the sister's vision. Eventually they find the sister and Dutchman. Matara orders to Karain to shoot the Dutchman, while he kills his sister. But at the fatal moment, Karain kills Matara, saving the others' lives. Karain then states that he his haunted by the ghost of his dead friend. Karain asks the crew of the schooner to help him put an end to the haunting. One of the crew give him a gilded sixpence, telling him that it is a charm. Karain accepts the charm and believes that he has finally been exorcised. The story ends with a coda, in which the narrator and one of the crew meet in London, and reflect on the story they have been told.\n\n\n== Significance ==\nImperialism: \"Karain\" is one of Conrad's early published works, and the first to deal with British imperialism explicitly. \n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nFinkelstein notes that \"there is nothing in the piece to disturb the general tenor of Maga's presentation of Empire\".\nGoGwilt notes that while the story \"contains all the ingredients of the imperial adventure tale\" popularised by writers such as H. Rider Haggard, Conrad \"ultimately produced a tale that turns its popular material against the assumptions of the genre\". GoGwilt also states that Conrad's attempt to represent \"native\" Malay experience is a nearly unique feature of the text amongst Conrad's oeuvre.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAdams, David (2001). \"\"REMORSE AND POWER\": CONRAD'S KARAIN AND THE QUEEN\".

        "content": "Raizan Kōgoishi (雷山神籠石) was an ancient castle (also known as a Korean-style fortresses in Japan (朝鮮式山城, Chōsen-shiki yamajiro) located in the city of  Itoshima, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. Its ruins have been protected as a National Historic Site since 1932. \n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the defeat of the combined Baekje and Yamato Japan forces, at the hands of the Silla and Tang China alliance at the Battle of Hakusukinoe in 663, the Yamato court feared an invasion from either or both Tang or Silla. In response, a huge network of shore fortifications was constructed throughout the rest of the 600s, often with the assistance of Baekje engineers, generals and artisans. Unaware of the outbreak of the Silla-Tang War (670–676), the Japanese would continue to build fortifications until 701, even after finding out that Silla was no longer friendly with Tang. The name \"kōgoishi\" means \"stones of divine protection,\" a name given them by the Meiji period archaeologist Tsuboi Shōgorō, who conjectured that they served as spiritual or practical protection for sacred sites. Scholars after Tsuboi determined that the structures are most likely the remains of practical, military fortifications, and were unlikely to have significant spiritual connections, although much remains unknown about these structures and there is very little contemporary documentary evidence.\nThe Raizan Kōgoishi is located on the northern slopes of 955-meter Mount Raizan, one of the Sefuri Mountains forming the border between Fukuoka and Saga Prefecture. It is located at an elevation of between 400 and 480 meters above sea level, and is estimated to be about 300 meters from east-to-west and 700 meters from-north to-south.  As it is located on a ridge that juts out north from Mount Raizan, it offers a panoramic view of the Itoshima Peninsula, as well as Hakata Bay and the Genkai Sea. It was built with castle walls blocking two valleys (approximately 730 meters apart), north and south. In most Kōgoishi, the fortifications surround the peak of the mountain, but Raizan Kōgoishi is unique in that the castle area does not include the mountain peak, and the castle wall crosses the same valley twice.\nThe ruins include water gates built on the north and south sides of the valley, and a group of stones extending east and west from the water gates. At the south water gate, there are two types of sluice gates: one is a culvert installed at the bottom of the stone rows, and the other is a water gutter installed in a part of the stone embankment, from which water flows. The north water gate is a strong structure made of cut stones piled up 12 meters long, 10 meters wide, and 3 meters high. From both the east and west ends of the water gate, the rows of stones open out in the shape of a letter \"C\" and climb up a steep slope toward the top of the ridge. In addition, two breaks in the stone rows that are presumed to be castle gate ruins have been found near the south water gate. \nRegarding the date of construction, the fortification is not mentioned in any ancient literature, so  its name, construction date, etc. are all uncertain. The current name of the fortification is after the name of the mountain, which is mentioned in the Nihon Shoki and Man'yōshū, but with no mention of fortifications. However, mention is made of an \"Inazumi Castle\" in the 699 AD entry of the Shoku Nihongi and as the location of that castle remains unknown, there is a theory that this entry could be referring to the Raizan Kōgoishi. Based on the construction technique and similarities with other known Kōgoishi sites, the most likely theory is that it was built in the middle of the 7th century. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nList of foreign-style castles in Japan\nKōgoishi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDe Lange, William (2021).

        "content": "Second Balochistan conflict refers to a rebellion by Nawab Nauroz Khan who took up arms in resistance to the One Unit policy, which decreased government representation for tribal leaders, from 1958 to 1959. He and his followers started a guerrilla war against Pakistan, and were arrested, charged with treason, and imprisoned in Hyderabad. Five of his family members, sons and nephews, were subsequently hanged on charges of treason and aiding in the murder of Pakistani troops. Nawab Nauroz Khan later died in captivity. \n\n\n== Previous rebellion ==\n\nIn 1948, Prince Agha Abdul Karim and  Prince Muhammad Rahim of Kalat launched a rebellion in response to accession of Kalat and with the aim of establishing Kalat as an independent state from Pakistan. With the arrest of the princes and loss of a lot of manpower, the rebellion ultimately came to an end in 1950 with Pakistan recapturing all territories.\n\n\n== Attack on Kalat palace ==\nIn 1958,Ahmad Yar Khan tried to ambush the Deputy Commissioner .He invited him to his place and when he came the palace guards led by the Khan's son, Prince Mohiuddin attacked him. Three persons were wounded. In retaliation the following day, a Tank of Pakistan military fired multiple rounds on the palace of Khan and the Khan was forced to surrender and was taken away to Lahore. While the Khan was being taken away, a crowd gathered outside the palace and upon a clash with the troops three were killed and at least two others were wounded. About 350 people were arrested in Kalat and neighbouring towns. It was alleged that the Khan had stored large quantity of weapons and food for a large private army to wage a rebellion against Pakistan.\nOn October 6, 1958, Pakistani President Iskander Mirza issued an order that took stripped powers away from Ahmed Yar Khan and  all his distinctions, privileges and immunities.\n\n\n== Dismissal of the government ==\nIskander Mirza abolished the constitution, imposed martial law, dissolved the national and provincial assemblies, and dismissed the government. Pakistani government also stressed the Baloch tribesman, especially in Jhalawan and Sarwan, to turn in their arms at the respective local police stations\n\n\n== One Unit scheme ==\n\nThe One Unit Scheme was the reorganisation of the provinces of Pakistan by the central Pakistani government. It was led by Prime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra on 22 November 1954 and passed on 30 September 1955. The government claimed that the programme would overcome the difficulty of administering the two unequal polities of West and East Pakistan separated from each other by more than a thousand miles. To diminish the differences between the two regions, the 'One Unit' programme merged the four provinces of West Pakistan (West Punjab, Sind, NWFP & Baluchistan) into a single province to parallel the province of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).\nThe One Unit program was met with great resistance and grievances were raised by the four provinces since its establishment. As per scholar Julien Levesque, the One Unit project had mainly been pushed by the Punjabi elite of West Pakistan since 1953 with the aim of preventing politicians from East Pakistan from gaining power at the centre. The National Awami Party successfully sponsored a bill in the National Assembly calling for its dissolution and providing for regional autonomy. This led to the military takeover of the national government. The One Unit programme remained in effect until 1970. Finally, President General Yahya Khan imposed Legal Framework Order No. 1970 to end the One Unit program and reinstate the provisional status of the Four Provinces as of August 1947.\n\n\n== Rebellion by Nauroz Khan ==\nAn armed battle began under the command of Nawab Nauroz Khan Zarakzai Zehri. Nawab Nauroz Khan gathered around one thousand armed Baloch tribals and demanded the immediate release of Ahmad Yar Khan of Kalat and the abolition of One Unit Scheme. As a result, a multiple battles erupted in the region, including near the Pakistan-Iran border,Jhalawan, Kohlu and Dera Bugti and in the suburbs of  Quetta. A large number of Pakistani troops led by Lt. Col. Tikka Khan. and supported by Air force were sent to quell the rebellion.\n\n\n== Negotiations and Surrender ==\nIn the early 1960s, Nawab Nauroz Khan and his men surrendered  after peace talks between the tribals and Pakistani government, who pledged to abolish One Unit Scheme and grant amnesty to Nauroz Khan and his men. Nauroz Khan said that government must first withdraw its troops from Balochistan, release the Khan of Kalat immediately, restore the princely state of Kalat and release all the political prisoners in Balochistan. He put a condition for surrendering. when Nauroz Khan refused to comply despite the concession offered by the government . A jirga was sent to Nauroz Khan, along with a Holy Qur’an as an assurance that he would come down from the mountains on its sanctity..   When the militants came down from the mountains, they kissed the Qur’an and said that they respect the Quran but they won't surrender. The government delegation kept reassuring them through the Qur’an that the government was living up to its promise. So they surrendered., however, around 160 insurgents, including Nauroz Khan and his son, were trialed in a military court in  Machh district. Nauroz Khan, his son, and five other family members were sentenced to death on the charges of rebellion and killing of Pakistani troops; however, Nauroz Khan's sentence was later changed to life imprisonment.Nauroz Khan spent his remaining life in Hyderabad prison.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Opticoelectron (Bulgarian: Оптикоелектрон) is a Bulgarian manufacturer of optics and optoelectronics based in the town of Panagyurishte in the Pazardzhik Province, Bulgaria. Along with Optix headquartered in the same town, the company is the main producer of optical equipment for the defense industry of Bulgaria.\n\n\n== History ==\nOpticoelectron was established in Panagyurishte in January 1971 with the inauguration of a workshop producing lenses. In June 1971 a decision of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria formally established the state enterprise United Factories Opticoelectron dedicated to the production of opticomechanics and opticoelectronics, that encompassed several factories in Panagyurishte, Sofia and Samokov. The construction of the current premises of the factory began in September 1971 in the western outskirts of Panagyurishte. In the same year in the nearby town of Strelcha was inaugurated the first subsidiary branch of Opticoelectron, the Worshop for Custom Equipment.\nThroughout the 1970s the factory diversified its products that also included machines for processing optical equipment and started mass production of indigenously developed equipment. By 1982 the United Factories Opticoelectron included 18 production facilities in southwestern half Bulgaria and the factories in Plovdiv, Pazardzhik and Velingrad were restructured in their own enterprises. The plants that remained affiliated with the main factory in Panagyurishte were several workshops in Strelcha, Lesichovo, Karabunar, Dospat and Ihtiman. The 1980s were a period of continuous expansion, with growing range of military and civilian products, increasing quality and revenue. A significant part of output was exported for the military of the Soviet Union and the countries of the Warsaw Pact. In that period Opticoelectron employed 5,000 workers in Panagyurishte alone, and 12,000 in total throughout Bulgaria.\nThe factory had an important role in the social life of Panagyurishte Municipality since the very start of its operation. It maintained numerous clubs that participated in local and national cultural, scientific and sports activities. There were recreational areas in the resort of Panagyurski kolonii. It was also crucial for the establishment of the Professional High School in the town.\nThe profound economic changes following the transition to a market economy after the Bulgarian Communist Party gave up power in 1989 had a significant impact on Opticoelectron. In 1992 the factory was included in the list of state enterprises for future liquidation. However, despite the difficulties and the reduction of the personnel, production never seized. In 1999 Opticoelectron was privatized and eventually paid back all previous debts. The company successfully found new markets, mainly in the European Union and NATO, entering a period of expansion.\n\n\n== Production and facilities ==\n\nThe premises of the company in the western outskirts of Panagyurishte cover an area of 260,000 m2, of which 108,000 m2 are dedicated to production. Opticoelectron employs 650 workers, of them 150 are engineers, specialized in designing own products and products on demand. It is the largest producer of optical and opticoelectronic equipment and components in the Balkan Peninsula. Opticoelectron has a closed cycle of production from design to manufacturing and marketing. Over 97% of the production is exported to EU countries, North America and the Middle East.\nThe company produces a wide arrange of military equipment, such as anti-aircraft and ground artillery sights for firing in daytime and in nighttime; day, night and thermal optical sights; SWIR lenses; laser rangefinders; laser target designators; surveillance systems; optical systems for armored vehicles; video observation, etc. Civilian production includes spherical lenses, ocular lenses, micro optics, flat optics, IR optics, glass molding, optical coatings, achromatic doublets and triples, optical assemblies, optical reticles, radii test plates, etc.\nOpticoelectron directs investments for research, new technologies, machines and efficiency. As part of the national and EU efforts to reduce emissions, in 2023 it commissioned a 5 MW solar power plant within the company's premises.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Opticoelectron\".

        "content": "Ito Castle (怡土城, Ito-jō) was an ancient castle (also known as a Korean-style fortresses in Japan (朝鮮式山城, Chōsen-shiki yamajiro) located in the city of  Itoshima, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. Its ruins have been protected as a National Historic Site since 1938, with the area under protection expanded in 1944 and in 2007. \n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the defeat of the combined Baekje and Yamato Japan forces, at the hands of the Silla and Tang China alliance at the Battle of Hakusukinoe in 663, the Yamato court feared an invasion from either or both Tang or Silla. In response, a huge network of shore fortifications was constructed throughout the rest of the 600s, often with the assistance of Baekje engineers, generals and artisans. Unaware of the outbreak of the Silla-Tang War (670–676), the Japanese would continue to build fortifications until 701, even after finding out that Silla was no longer friendly with Tang. The name \"kōgoishi\" means \"stones of divine protection,\" a name given them by the Meiji period archaeologist Tsuboi Shōgorō, who conjectured that they served as spiritual or practical protection for sacred sites. Scholars after Tsuboi determined that the structures are most likely the remains of practical, military fortifications, and were unlikely to have significant spiritual connections, although much remains unknown about these structures and there is very little contemporary documentary evidence. Ito Castle in unique in this class of fortifications, in that it was built much later, in the Nara period and details of its construction dates and the people involved are known. It is also less in the style of Korean-style fortresses, but exhibits characteristics of continental Chinese-style mountain fortresses.\nIto Castle is located on the western slopes of 955-meter Mount Takasuyama at an elevation of 416 meters. The ruins include the remains of eight watchtowers (monomiyagura) along the line of the ridge, and a two kilometer stretch of earthen ramparts from north-to-south at the base of the mountain. Studies of some of the earthworks indicate that concentrated seawater and lime-based materials may have been mixed in with the earth to increase the strength of the rampart.There was once a moat 15 meters wide on the outside of the earthworks, and it is assumed that there was also an inner moat in some parts of the castle. \nPer the Shoku Nihongi, construction of the castle was started in 756 AD by Kibi no Makibi, who went to Tang China twice as an envoy from the Japanese court and it was completed in 768. Kibi no Makibi was a man skilled in military tactics, and it is assumed that be obtained knowledge of contemporary Chinese fortifications during these visits. The purpose of building the castle was either in preparation for the conquest of Silla by Japan, or protection against invasion by Tang China during the An Lushan rebellion.  Also, as Kibi no Makibi was a political rival of Fujiwara no Nakamaro, construction of the castle also served the purpose of removing him from proximity to the Imperial court for several years. The castle was never used in combat, and fell into ruins by the early Heian period. Centuries later, the Harada clan, who ruled Itoshima during the Sengoku period, reused this site and built Takaso Castle, which served as their base until it was destroyed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1587. \nNumerous pieces of roof tiles, pottery, and walls have been discovered from the castle area in archaeological excavations starting in 1938. While most of the tiles are flat tiles, no round tiles or eaves tiles have been excavated. A flat tiles are large,  measuring approximately 41 by 31 centimeters, and approximately five centimeters in thick, with a weight of ten kilograms. The location of the tile kiln where the tiles were fired is not clear. Excavated items are displayed at the Itokoku History Museum in Itoshima. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\nList of foreign-style castles in Japan\nKōgoishi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDe Lange, William (2021).

        "content": "Tekeli Rebellion — the uprising of Tekeli Khanate against Shah Tahmasp I in 1531. This rebellion is referred to as the \"Afati-Tekeluyan\" in historical literature.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1527, at the instigation of Chuxa Sultan Tekeli, Div Sultan Rumlu was killed. Chuxa Sultan convinced Shah Tahmasp that Div Sultan was causing discord among the tribes. This led to the downfall of the Rumlu nobles' rule. Governance had fallen solely into the hands of Chuxa Sultan. Oktay Afandiyev writes that he wielded such power that under him, \"only the name of the shah remained\". He \"divided most of the provinces among his Tekeli tribe relatives and elevated each of them to the rank of khan, and the degree of sultan\".\nNot long after, due to Chuxa Sultan Tekeli's independent actions in his roles as both Amir al-umara and Vizier, Shah Tahmasp decided to remove him from office. Soon, the influence of Chuxa Sultan and the Tekeli tribe dwindled significantly. In 1529, during the battle near Zirabad, when Tekeli commanders abandoned the battlefield, the Safavid army faced the danger of defeat.\nAnother event occurred during Ubeid Khan's attack on Herat. Ubeid Khan began looting and pressuring the people around Herat in order to prevent the entry of food supplies into the city, as he had done in previous sieges. Chuxa Sultan, realizing the likelihood of falling into the hands of Ubeid's Uzbeks and understanding the scarcity and delay of assistance from the Shah, sent Husayn Khan Khwaja Ishak Siavashani to Ubeid Khan, informing him that, on the condition of not harming Herat and its inhabitants, he would evacuate the Qizilbash and his family from the city. Ubeid Khan accepted this proposal and withdrew. Husayn Khan, along with Samli, Sam Mirza, and all the Qizilbash, left Herat and headed towards Sistan. Thus, Herat fell into the hands of the Uzbeks. One of the architects of the capture of Herat was Chuxa Sultan. Chuxa Sultan had forbidden the Qizilbash army from sending aid to those besieged in Herat.\n\n\n== Rebellion ==\nIn the month of Zulqadah of the year 937 AH (June 17, 1531 AD), Husayn Khan arrived with Sam Mirza at the Shah's headquarters near Isfahan. Chuxa Sultan and the Tekeli commanders and others who were present in the army welcomed them. According to Abdi Bey Shirazi in his work \"Takmiletul-Ahbar,\" Chuxa Sultan, addressing Husayn Khan as \"son,\" decided that he would host him at his residence the next day. \"Finally, as night approached, Husayn Khan was granted permission to return to his army. Sam Mirza was not permitted to accompany him. Shah Tahmasib, who was expecting him, personally escorted him to the royal Haram so that his mother, Baim, and sisters could rejoice at seeing him. This gesture weighed heavily on Husayn Khan, and he changed his mind. Chuxa Sultan noticed that Husayn Khan, who went to the residence without Sam Mirza, was upset. Therefore, Mirza Safar Avachini, his vizier known as Ariq Vizir, and two or three trusted commanders of Tekeli were sent to him to soothe and entertain him. They were to ensure that he would come to Chuxa Sultan's residence in the morning without any resentment.\"\nHasan Bey Rumlu writes in \"Ahsan al-Tavarikh\" about Chuxa Sultan's plan:\n\"Chuxa Sultan, adopting a hypocritical attitude towards Husayn Khan, intended to assassinate him during a gathering. To this end, he busied himself with organizing a feast to invite them (Husayn Khan and his close associates) the next day. Some of the faithful followers of the Shah, aware of this plan, informed Husayn Khan of this situation.\"\nThus, Husayn Khan learned of this plan by Chuxa Sultan. He sent a group of armed men to Chuxa Sultan's residence when night fell. Chuxa Sultan fled to the audience hall in the hope of finding refuge. However, he could not obtain the support he sought from Shah Tahmasp. Husayn Khan attacked the Shamli state. A clash erupted between the Shamli and Tekeli factions in the presence of the Shah. During the confrontation, two arrows struck the Shah's crown. The Zulqadar guards were on the Shah's side. They allied with the Shamlis. Among the Zulqadar guards standing by the Shah, a man named Misir Qorquzlu severely wounded Chuxa Sultan. According to Abdi Bey, Chuxa Sultan's two close associates, his arrow and bow bearer Jamshid and his coat bearer Mustafa, found him lying on the ground. They carried him into the audience hall of the royal court. When the Shah saw him in that state, he ordered those two individuals to take him to the slope of the tent. He should rest for a while as he was injured. He also instructed them to keep his condition secret. In the battle that ensued, the Shamlis, despite being outnumbered, defeated the Tekelis and retreated to the Genduman plateau and then to Fars. Three hundred Shamlis were taken captive by the Tekelis.\nTekeli leaders sent an envoy to the Azerbaijan Amir al-Umara Ulama Sultan Tekeli. However, due to the long distance, the envoy could not reach Isfahan. In the meantime, to maintain the position of the representative within their ranks, they appointed Chuxa Sultan's eldest son, Shahqubad, without consulting him. While this information is confirmed by Hasan Bey Rumlu, Iskandar Bey Munshi Turkman, and Budaq Qazvini, according to Abdi Bey Shirazi, the Shah awaited calm and precisely appointed Shahqubad himself. Abdi Bey writes that the Shah replaced Chuxa Sultan's eldest son with his father. His younger son, Ali, was given the title of sultan and the rank of emir, which was the duty of Shahqubad. The efforts of the Tekeli emirs to preserve their own sovereignty were met with dissatisfaction by other Qizilbash tribes who were subjected to the oppression of the Tekeli feudal lords, including the Ustajlu, Rumlu, Zulqadar, and Afshar emirs. A few days later, in the battle around Imam Sahl Ali in the Genduman plateau, the Tekelis were defeated. Seeing that Shah Tahmasp had negative views towards them, the Tekelis decided to escape. For this purpose, they sent a person named Yanchi Qulu to the royal court to capture the Shah. However, Shah Tahmasib learned of this plan and ordered the killing of Yanchi Qulu. Under the Shah's command, members of the Tekeli tribe also began to be severely punished. Another reason for Shah Tahmasp's order was Chuxa Sultan's sons killing several members of the Ustajlu, Zulqadar, and Afshar tribes without consulting the Shah, and attacking the royal court with armed forces. These events are detailed in \"Takhmīlat al-Akhbār.\"\nŞah Tahmasib, after a 20-day break, decided to confront the accursed Tekelis. All tribes armed themselves and gathered at the gates of the royal court. When the Tekeli tribe arrived at the gate and assessed the situation, feeling completely hopeless, they turned towards the Baghdad road. The previous events repeated themselves. Other tribes began to pursue the Tekelis. From the Tekelis, the chief guard Duray Bey and the steward known as Kabe Khalife, whose name was Ibrahim Khalife, were killed. The notable figures and descendants of the Tekelis were each tied up and brought to the shrine. They were offered the sherbet, a drink of death, by the guards of the previous prison, and thus \"Afet-i Tekeluyan\" became the historical event. After a few days, all those who escaped and other Tekelis came to the shrine around Hamadan with the hope of \"we are not personally guilty\" and were subjected to the death penalty by the sword.\nThus, many famous Tekeli commanders were killed. Others fled to Baghdad, seeking refuge with Mohammed Khan Sharafuddin's son, Tekeli. However, Mohammed Khan did not release them in Baghdad to demonstrate his loyalty to Shah Tahmasib. Instead, he instructed Budaq Qazvini to deal with them. Budaq Qazvini reported that there were 1800 Tekelis. He provided food for the Tekelis and their horses. Mohammed Khan, on the other hand, killed Quduz Sultan Tekeli, one of the commanders of the Tekeli tribe, and several other Tekeli commanders, and sent their heads to Shah Tahmasib.\nThis event is famous in Safavid history as the \"Tekelu disaster\" or \"Afet-i Tekeluyan.\"\n\n\n== Result ==\nIn August 1531, Shah Tahmasp sent an envoy to Shiraz inviting Hüseyin Khan Shamli to the palace. The Shah's aim was to maintain balance among the Qizilbash. For this purpose, Hüseyin Khan Shamli and Abdullah Khan Ustacılı were appointed as co-amirs al-umara. Thus, with the death of Chuxa Sultan, Hüseyin Khan Shamli succeeded him.\nThe rule of the Tekeli lords (1527–1531) was replaced by the rule of the Shamli feudal lords. After the death of Chuxa Sultan, Hüseyin Khan Shamli became the most powerful feudal lord and assumed the roles of deputy and amir al-umara. Hüseyin Khan, like his predecessor, focused initially on securing favorable positions for his tribe, dividing \"the best provinces among the Shamli lords\" and not allowing interference in state affairs. In 1531–1532, he had Amir Kıvameddin Cəfər Savəcini killed. Ahmed Bey Nurkamal İsfahani was appointed as the new vizier. The rise of Hüseyin Khan Shamli in the palace was not well received by Ulama Bey Tekeli, leading to a rebellion in 1531.\n\n\n== References ==",

Issued by the Electoral Court, it is the only document that certifies the identity of the voter in electoral instances.\n\n\n== Procedure ==\nThe civic credential is obtained after the mandatory registration that every Uruguayan citizen over 18 must complete before the Electoral Court, the body which oversees the electioneering process. Once the document is issued, the citizen is registered in the \"National Civic Registry\", an electoral registry of citizens with the right to vote.\nThe credential must be obtained by all Uruguayans of legal age, and in accordance with the nationality law, it can be obtained by those born abroad with at least one Uruguayan parent, by legal citizens and non-legal citizens foreigners with habitual residence in the Republic for fifteen years.\nEach credential contains the holder's registration information: the full name, a series of three letters and order number –based on their place of residence–, a right thumb-digit impression and a side-view photo.\n\n\n== Use ==\nSince voting in Uruguay is mandatory in accordance with Article 77 of the Constitution of the Republic, the civic credential serves to identify the voter before the commissions receiving votes in general, municipal and primary elections, referendums and any type of electoral process, including the elections of the Banco de Previsión Social, and the university elections of the University of the Republic. In addition, with the identification information of the document, the citizen can subscribe to popular initiatives calling for referendums and constitutional reforms.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUruguayan passport\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCivic Credential on the Electoral Court website",

The company was established in 2012. It is headquartered in Neuss \nThe company operates one of the largest inland port operations in Europe (in Düsseldorf, Neuss, and Cologne) and is also active as a private railway transport company (EVU) in rail freight transport.\nThe company owns six inland ports with a total turnover of 25.4 million tons (2018) on 560 hectares of land. These include four ports in Cologne (Godorf, Deutz, Niehl I, and Niehl II), the port in Neuss, and the Düsseldorf Harbor as well as the port in Düsseldorf-Reisholz. With around 90 own locomotives and around 700 freight cars, the company carries around 20 million tonnes of freight per year.\n\n\n== Port operations ==\nRheinCargo operates six different public inland ports in the cities of Neuss, Düsseldorf, and Cologne. RheinCargo offers various port services at all port locations and develops tailor-made trimodal solutions together with or for its customers. The port infrastructure includes a total of 48 crane systems, with an average of 50 ship clearances per day (as of 2022). In addition to handling bulk cargo in the ports of RheinCargo, the handling of combined loading units also takes place.\n\n\n== Locomotives ==\nRheinCargo uses electric, diesel, and dual locomotives for its freight transport.\nMany of the diesel locomotives were taken over by RheinCargo from HGK and NDH during the renaming process and were only repainted (owner identification, company logos), retaining the red HGK or Neusser Eisenbahn livery. Class 66 locomotives were repainted during the main inspection and have been in silver-gray livery since then, with the DE 67 omitted, so this locomotive retained its green-yellow livery, which dates back to the times of the former leasing company Ascendos Rail Leasing.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRheinCargo",

        "content": "ioki is a German technology company specialising on digital services and products for public transport with its headquarters in Frankfurt. ioki is an acronym for Input Output Künstliche Intelligenz (Input Output Artificial Intelligence).\nioki provides digital services for public transport such as a ridepooling platform, data-based transport planning and a navigation system for bus drivers. While the majority of services is currently still provided in the DACH region, the company's product and service offering is also growing in Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. ioki's clients include cities, public transport companies, school districts, government entities and private organisations.\n\n\n== History ==\nioki was founded in 2017 as a corporate startup of the Deutsche Bahn — Germany's main railway company — to focus on and drive forward autonomous public transport. Over the years, the product portfolio and services expanded and led to an integrated focus on digitalisation and accessibility.\nIn October 2017, the first autonomous bus line on public roads in Germany was launched in the Lower Bavarian spa town Bad Birnbach with ioki's operating system.\nThe company launched ioki Hamburg, one of the oldest and most successful demand-responsive transport services in Germany.\nioki collaborated with the Verkehrsbetriebe Hamburg (VHH) to create a shuttle that transports passengers around the clock in electric vehicles. It was later renamed hvv hop. The service started with ten vehicles and has grown since its launch. In 2019, ioki and Verkehrsbetriebe Hamburg (VHH) won the Deutscher Mobilitätspreis (German Mobility Award) for the ioki Hamburg project. Since then, various on-demand projects all over Europe have been set in motion.\nIn February 2024, ioki and the teledriving start-up Vay announced their partnership to realise the first remotely driven on-demand service in public transport.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nioki is a software-as-a-service and technology company. The ridepooling and routing platform from ioki is suitable for both driver-based and autonomous transport. The platform is intended to create carpools and combine the booked trips into optimised routes. It consists of an administration tool for the operator, the vehicle app, and the customizable passenger app.\nTo optimise public transport, ioki uses data-based mobility analyses to identify the population's needs in the respective service area and enables assessment of the local mobility situation. The company recently added a navigation system that specialises in bus navigation and consists of a web version for route management and a navigation app for the driver. ioki is member of several organisations and networks to promote digital and autonomous mobility, such as SAAM (Swiss Association for Autonomous Mobility) and PAVE Europe. As of April 2024, the company reached 5 million passengers on the platform.\n\n\n== References ==",

Also involved are the cities of Arnsberg, Brilon, Erwitte, Hallenberg, Hamm, Marsberg, Medebach, Olsberg, Rüthen, Soest, Sundern, Warstein, Werl, and Winterberg, as well as the municipalities of Anröchte, Ense, Lippetal, Möhnesee, and Welver.\nThe following were consolidated in the company:\n\nThe railway lines Hamm–Lippborg and Neheim-Hüsten–Arnsberg Süd of the RLE including the RLE bus operation\nThe Neheim-Hüsten–Sundern railway line including bus operation\nThe transport companies Kreis Brilon – Kleinbahn Steinhelle–Medebach – (bus operation only) and\nThe partial operation Brilon–Warstein–Lippstadt of the bus service of the Westfälische Landes-Eisenbahn.\nOperations management for rail freight traffic is located in Hamm and Hüsten Ost; for bus transport, the depots in Arnsberg, Brilon, Lippstadt, and Soest are responsible.\nThe operation of the remaining freight traffic of the Westfälische Landes-Eisenbahn in the urban area of Soest (taken over by the RLE from 1973) was relatively short-lived. It was carried out by Deutsche Bundesbahn from May 1987 and completely discontinued on December 31, 2001.\nThe rail network, serving only freight traffic, was 41.732 km long in 2012.\nRLG operates two diesel locomotives, No. 54 (MaK G 1206, built in 2008) and No. 68 (KHD DG 1200 BBM, built in 1962).\nIn bus transport, a total of 217 vehicles (including 107 own buses) were used in 2012 on a route network of 3,993 km in length, which annually transported  around 12.7 million passengers  in the district of Soest and in the Hochsauerlandkreis.\nSince 2012, RLG, together with Hochsauerlandkreis, Kreis Soest, and BRS Busverkehr Ruhr-Sieg GmbH, has been implementing the mobil4you project. Planned was, among other things, an electric bus as a neighborhood bus in Winterberg and Medebach, which was partially operated between 2013 and 2016 (now replaced in Winterberg by a community bus).\nIn 2022, RLG had 12.8 million passengers.\n\n\n== Route ==\n\n\n=== Express bus lines ===\n\n\n=== Regional bus lines Soest ===\n\n\n=== Citybus Arnsberg ===\n\n\n=== Citybus Soest ===\n\n\n=== Other lines (Neheim/Arnsberg) ===\n323 Neheim-Hüsten, Train Station – Hövel - Holzen (school service)\n326 Neheim-Hüsten, Train Station – Neheim, Bus Station – - Wimbern (school service)\n412 Arnsberg – Schreppenberg – Wennigloh (school service)\n413 Schreppenberg – Breitenbruch (school service)\n414 Arnsberg, Neumarkt – Uentrop (school service)\nN5 Arnsberg, Neumarkt – Niedereimer – Bruchhausen – Hüsten – Neheim, Bus Station – Bergheim – Bachum – Voßwinkel\nN6 Sundern, Town Hall – Müschede – Herdringen – Neheim-Hüsten, Train Station – Neheim, Bus Station – Niederense – Bremen\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nKetteler, Friedhelm, Paul Wambach (1980).

        "content": "The Grito Lares flag (Spanish: Bandera del Grito de Lares), most commonly known as La Bandera de Lares (Lares flag), represents the Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares) revolt of 1868, the first of two short-lived rebellions against Spanish rule in Puerto Rico. It consists of a large, white Greek cross in the center that extends to all four sides of the flag, dividing it into four equal rectangles, two red and two blue, the upper left of which bears a centered, five-pointed white star. The white star stands for liberty and freedom, the red rectangles for the blood poured by the heroes of the revolt, and the white cross for the yearning of homeland redemption. Established in Lares 27 years before revolutionaries adopted the current flag of Puerto Rico in New York, the flag is recognized as the first flag of the island.\nToday, the flag is not only the official flag of the municipality of Lares, but it is also  most commonly used alongside the current flag of Puerto Rico to show support for Puerto Rican independence from the United States, rejecting other alternatives on the issue of Puerto Rico’s political status, namely statehood or integration into the U.S. as a state, and the current intermediary status of commonwealth as an unincorporated and organized U.S. territory.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn September 1868, the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico launched the Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares) revolt against Spanish rule in the island,  carrying as their standard a flag conceived by pro-independence leader Ramón Emeterio Betances and embroidered by Mariana \"Brazos de Oro\" Bracetti with flag-making materials provided by Eduvigis Beauchamp Sterling. Betances combined the quartered flag of the First Dominican Republic and the lone star on the flag of Cuba to create the flag, with the aim of promoting the union of neighboring Spanish-speaking Greater Antilles—the single-nation islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic in the two-nation island of Hispaniola—into a regional Antillean Confederation for the protection and preservation of their sovereignty and interests.\nIn 1868, during the Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares) revolt, Francisco Ramírez Medina, having been sworn in as Puerto Rico's first president by the revolutionaries, proclaimed the Lares flag as the national emblem of the \"Republic of Puerto Rico,” and placed it on the high altar of the San José Parish in Lares, Puerto Rico, making it the first Puerto Rican flag.\n\n\n=== Original flags ===\n\nThere were several flags made for the revolt, but only two have survived to this day. The first Lares flag is quartered by a centered white cross, with two bottom deep red rectangles and two top light blue rectangles, the left of which bears a small, tiled, centered, white five-pointed star. According to anthropologist Ricardo Alegría, the flag was taken from the altar of the San José Parish of Lares by Spanish Captain José de Perignat, who kept it until his family donated it to Fordham University in New York City. In 1954, the university then gifted the flag to the Museum of History, Anthropology and Art of the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, then headed by Alegría, and in 1988, it was restored by the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.\nSince the early 20th century, some historians have questioned the authenticity of the flag, as there is no documentary evidence to validate that it was used in the revolt or that it was placed on the altar of the San José Parish in Lares, Puerto Rico. It has been speculated that this flag is not an original Lares flag, but a copy made in the 1930s by nationalists for their commemoration of the Grito de Lares revolt. Yet at the same time, other historians claim that, despite the absence of primary sources to validate the flag, there is a long oral tradition of testimonies that authenticate it.\n\nThe second Lares flag is quartered by a centered white cross, with two deep red squares on the fly side and two dark blue squares on the hoist side, the top of which bears a small, tiled, centered, white five-pointed star. According to the Archivo Digital Nacional de Puerto Rico (ADNPR) (National Digital Archive of Puerto Rico), the flag, considered to be \"La Coronela,” the most important flag that was used by the first company commanded by the colonel of the armies, was captured in 1868 by Spanish Captain Manuel Iturriaga, who led the repression of the revolutionaries of Lares, in the Piedra Gorda neighborhood of Camuy, Puerto Rico after it was discovered on the farm of a revolutionary buried in one of two wooden boxes alongside hundreds of cartridges for militia rifles. After Iturriaga's death, the flag was donated by his son to the old Museo de Artillería de España (Museum of Artillery of Spain). Since its discovery in 2022, the flag is exhibited at the Museo Del Ejército (Museum of the Army) in Toledo, Spain.\nIn 1872, the flag was mentioned in “Historia de la insurrección de Lares…” (“History of the insurrection of Lares…”), a chronicle on the Grito de Lares written by Spanish telegrapher and journalist José Manuel Pérez Moris, a contemporary who had migrated to Puerto Rico from Cuba in 1869. Categorizing the flag as “la verdadera bandera de Lares” (“the real flag of Lares”), the  Centro de Estudios Avanzados de Puerto Rico y el Caribe (CEAPRC) (Center of Advanced Studies of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean), claims that primary sources like Pérez Moris’ account of the revolt prove that this flag is the authentic one created by the revolutionary forces of the “Republic of Puerto Rico” that was to be born from the Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares) revolt in 1868.\n\n\n=== Substituted flag ===\nThe Grito de Lares flag was replaced by a new revolutionary flag, which is the current of the flag of Puerto Rico. In December 1895, Juan de Mata Terreforte and other exiled Puerto Rican revolutionaries, many of them veterans of the Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares) revolt who fought alongside commander Manuel Rojas Luzardo, re-established the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico under the name Sección Puerto Rico del Partido Revolucionario Cubano (Puerto Rico Section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party) as part of the Cuban Revolutionary Party in New York City, where they continued to advocate for Puerto Rican independence from Spain with the support of Cuban national hero José Martí and other Cuban exiles, who similarly began their struggle for self-determination in 1868 when the Grito de Yara (Cry of Yara) revolt triggered the Ten Years' War (Guerra de los Diez Años) for independence against Spanish rule in Cuba, which, along with Puerto Rico, represented all that remained from Spain’s once extensive American empire since 1825.\nDetermined to affirm the union of the Cuban and Puerto Rican struggle for national independence and fight against Spanish colonialism into a single, common cause, on December 22, with the knowledge and approval of their fellow Cuban revolutionaries, Terreforte, vice-president of the committee, and around fifty-eight fellow members gathered at the no longer existent Chimney Corner Hall in Manhattan, unanimously adopted the Cuban flag with colors inverted as the new flag to represent an independent “Republic of Puerto Rico,” substituting the Lares flag, which had been used by revolutionaries as the flag of a prospective independent Puerto Rico since their attempt at self-determination in 1868, but was eventually rejected, as it represented a failed revolt, a sentiment strongly supported by Lola Rodríguez de Tío, Puerto Rican poet, pro-independence leader, and committee member, who spent her later life exiled in liberated Cuba. \n\n\n== Colors ==\nNo official document in Puerto Rico provides the colors of the flag. While the exact colors of the flag have not been established by law, below are the most commonly used color shades. The intensity of both blue and red color shades changes to keep them complementary to each other.\n\n\n=== Current medium blue flag ===\n\nMedium blue Grito de Lares flag, matching the current flag of Puerto Rico and Lares, uses the following color shades:\n\n\n=== Dark blue flag ===\n\nDark blue Grito de Lares flag, matching the dark blue flag of Puerto Rico and the original dark blue Grito de Lares flag exhibited in Spain, one of two original versions of the flag available today, uses the following color shades:\n\n\n=== Light blue flag ===\nThe light blue Grito de Lares flag has become increasingly popular in recent years. Today, representations of the flag vary, with some featuring a uranian blue color shade, matching the light blue color shade of the original light blue Grito de Lares flag exhibited in Puerto Rico, while others use more colorful light blue shades, including vivid sky blue and deep sky blue. The light blue Grito de Lares flag is most commonly displayed in the following color shades:\n\n\n==== Uranian blue ====\n\nUranian blue variation of light blue Grito de Lares flag matching the colors of the uranian blue flag of Puerto Rico and the light blue Grito de Lares flag exhibited in Puerto Rico, one of two original versions of the flag available today, uses the following color shades:\n\nUranian blue is named after the planet Uranus, which in turn bears the name of Uranus, the primordial god personifying the sky and the heavens in Greek mythology.\n\n\n==== Vivid sky blue ====\n\nVivid sky blue variation of light blue Grito de Lares flag, the most popular of two modern interpretations of the light blue flags seen today, which matches the colors of the vivid sky blue flag of Puerto Rico, uses the following color shades:\n\n\n==== Deep sky blue ====\n\nDeep sky blue variation of light blue Grito de Lares flag, the second most popular of two modern interpretations seen today, which matches the colors of the deep sky blue flag of Puerto Rico, uses the following color shades:\n\n\n== Dimensions ==\nNo official document in Puerto Rico provides the exact dimensions of the flag’s shape, cross, and five-pointed star. While the exact proportions of the flag have not been established by law, the most commonly used and widely accepted layout of the flag is as follows:\n\nMost representations of the flag follow these specifications, with the components likely to vary being the size of the cross and star. The width of the cross is occasionally displayed bigger than the most commonly used size of one-ninth (1⁄9) of the flag length for its vertical post width and one-sixth (1⁄6) of the flag width for its horizontal crossbar width, and the diameter of the star is occasionally displayed smaller than the most commonly used size of one-third (1⁄3) of the flag width.\n\n\n== Symbolism ==\nIn 1868, Puerto Rican pro-independence leader Ramón Emeterio Betances, urged Mariana Bracetti to knit the revolutionary flag of the Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares), using as design the quartered flag of the First Dominican Republic and the lone star of the Cuban flag with the aim of promoting Betances’ idea of uniting the three neighboring Spanish-speaking Caribbean territories of Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic into an Antillean Confederation for the protection and preservation of their sovereignty and interests.\nAccording to Puerto Rican poet Luis Lloréns Torres, the white cross stands for the yearning of homeland redemption, the red rectangles for the blood poured by the heroes of the revolt, and the white star for liberty and freedom.  It is assumed that like the blue triangle on the current of Puerto Rico, the blue rectangles represent the sky and waters of the island.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Kilsyth Cobras is an NBL1 South club based in Melbourne, Victoria. The club fields a team in both the Men's and Women's NBL1 South. The club is a division of Kilsyth and Mountain District Basketball Association Inc. (K&MDBA), the major administrative basketball organisation in the City of Maroondah. The Cobras play their home games at Kilsyth Sports Centre.\n\n\n== Club history ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nKilsyth and Mountain District Basketball Association Inc. (K&MDBA) was established in 1963. In 1987, Eastern Sports Development Ltd (ESD) was established to serve as the management body of Kilsyth Basketball.\n\n\n=== SEABL ===\nIn 1984, the Kilsyth Cobras men's team debuted in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL). In 1985, the Cobras finished fourth in the SEABL regular season and went on to reach the ABA National grand final, where they won the National championship with a victory over the Bulleen Boomers.\nIn 1990, the Cobras were inaugural members of the SEABL women's competition. In 1997, the women's team made their first SEABL grand final and finished runners-up to the Frankston Blues. In 1998, the women's team won the SEABL championship and the ABA National championship. They went on to finish as SEABL runners-up again in 1999.\nIn 1999, the men's team won the SEABL East Conference championship but went on to lose in the ABA National grand final to the Geelong Supercats. In 2000, the men's team finished second in the South Conference and went on to reach the ABA National grand final, where they lost to the Hobart Chargers.\nIn 2002, the women's team won the SEABL championship and the ABA National championship. In 2003, the women's team lost in the SEABL grand final to the Bendigo Braves. In 2005 and 2007, the men's team lost in the South Conference grand final to the Braves. In 2008, the women's team won their third SEABL championship.\nIn 2015 and 2016, the women's team won back-to-back South Conference titles but lost both years in the SEABL grand final to the Dandenong Rangers.\n\n\n=== NBL1 ===\nAfter the demise of the SEABL following the 2018 season, a new competition known as NBL1 debuted in 2019 with the Cobras playing in the inaugural season. The women's team reached the grand final, where they defeated the Geelong Supercats 86–76 to win the NBL1 championship. Cobras guard Lauren Nicholson was named grand final MVP. The NBL1 South season did not go ahead in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKilsyth Basketball official website",

        "content": "The Attack in Hooghly (Danish; Angrebet i Hooghly) was a Danish attack on two Bengali ships during the Dano-Mughal War in 1671. The Danes succeeded in blowing up the Bengali ships, and violence continued off the coasts of Kalingapatnam and Balasore.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 1642 the Danish East India Company declared war on the Mughal Empire. Because of the Dano-Swedish Wars Denmark did not have the means to send any ships to Danish India, and relations were subsequently cut. Relations with Denmark were reestablished in 1669 together with a new Danish East India Company. At this point the war against Bengal was approved by the Danish government, yet urged the Danes in India to sue for peace if advantageous.\nIn 1672 king Christian V of Denmark (r 1670–1699) requested compensation for the losses of Danish vessels, though this request was never fulfilled by the Mughals. This, along with other factors, made the Danes increasingly brazen, and the Danes even attacked Bengal itself in 1671.\n\n\n== Expedition to Bengal ==\nIn 1672 a Danish force of 6500 men were brought to Hooghly. 1500 of the men was lost due to the sinking of a barge on the Ganges River. The Danish East India Company sold most of their goods to two local Bengali merchants; Rangsordas and Sonderdas. They sold their goods to them as a compromise not to trade with others for the next couple of months. At Hooghly the Danes noticed two Bengali ships, which were returning from a voyage to Ceylon. The ships were driven towards land near Hooghly, and the Danes subsequently blew the Bengali vessels up.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe renewed violence continued during the following years. In 1673 the Danes took a large Bengali ship of 170 cargoes near Balasore, and transported it to Tranquebar. This also happened to another ship which was carrying Maldivian cowries the same year.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDannemarksnagore – City/town in West Bengal, IndiaPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nSkirmish at Pipli – Confrontation between the Danes and Mughals in Pipli\nCattle War – Conflict between Danish India and the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom\nLoss of the St. Jacob – Seizure of a Danish ship by Benglis\nDano-Mughal War – Danish colonial conflict against the Mughal Empire\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Book sources ===\nAndersen, Eskil (1669).

        "content": "\"Singleton\" is a science-fiction short story by Australian writer Greg Egan, first published in Interzone 176 in February 2002. The short story was included in the collections Crystal Nights and Other Stories in 2009, Oceanic in 2009 and The Best of Greg Egan in 2020. The short story is set in the same universe as Egan's short story Oracle and Egan's novel Schild's Ladder.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2003, Ben, after some hesistation, intervenes in a kitchen hand being beaten to death. Feeling confident, he later invites his fellow student Francine to a concert and begins a relationship with her. In 2012, after Ben arrives back from Basra, Francine tells him to be pregnant. He reads about an experiment involving quantum computers conducted at Delft University and begins to think about the many-world-interpretation. Francine later suffers a miscarriage. In 2020, Ben participates in a neurological experiment, which proves consciousness to be a purely classical phenomenon. Parallel, he develops the qusp (abbreviation for „Quantum Singleton Processor“) only carrying out a single calculation without making alternatives real. He discusses with Francine about an operation enabling her to have children after the miscarriage again, but they decide on rather using the qusp to raise an AI child. In 2029, they experiment with Zelda, a neural network of a mouses brain running on a qusp. The qusp is already used to create adai (abbreviation for „Autonomously Developing Artificial Intelligence“). In 2031, they give in blood samples used to create an adai child, which they name Helen. Five bodies are delivered for Helen to use. In 2041, Helen slowly begins to find out about her difference to other children and asks her parents, who discuss telling her the truth. Ben calms her down by hinting, that she has something better and newer, which actually is what causes a rise of hate against adai. In 2050, Helen has vanished. Ben and Francine have both spend years searching for her. Ben finally finds her in shackles and retrieves her qusp. On their way home, he tells her about the beating which started everything. Ben reflects, that there are still branches, which haven't yet or will never invent the qusp. Helen then wants to initiate contact with them, claiming she only needs time.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKaren Burnham, writing in the New York Review of Science Fiction, concludes after a discussion of the short stories Axiomatic, Mister Volition and Singleton, that \"not everyone is as sanguine about the continuity of consciousness when making the transition to substances other than our organic brains nor so worried about the moral implications of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics.\" She claims that \"Egan’s stories show a continuity of concern about these subjects that refuses superficial answers and instead examines them in depth.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSingleton title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\nSingleton (full text on Egan's website)",

        "content": "Renee Jimenez (born December 22, 1981) is an American college basketball coach who is currently the head coach of the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos women's basketball team. She previously served as a head coach at the NCAA Division II level with Cal State Monterey Bay, Cal State San Bernardino, and Cal State San Marcos.\n\n\n== Early life and playing career ==\nJimenez grew up in Ventura, California, and went to UC Santa Barbara women's basketball games and camps from an early age. She attended Ventura High School in Ventura, where she played basketball. As a junior in 1999, Jimenez was an honorable mention all-Channel League selection. As a senior, she helped the Cougars win the Santa Barbara Nike Tournament of Champions Large Schools title at the Thunderdome on her 18th birthday and earned second-team all-Channel League honors. Jimenez also played on a club team called the Ventura Stars. While still in high school, she helped teach at local girls' basketball clinics.\nJimenez played one year at Ventura College under head coach Ned Mircetic and won the 2001 California junior college championship before transferring to San Francisco State University. She played for three seasons for the Gators from 2001 to 2004 and finished her career as the program's all-time leader in three-pointers made. A team captain for two years, Jimenez also set school records for most three-pointers made (62) and attempted (195) in a single season. She graduated in 2004 with a bachelor's degree in liberal studies and kinesiology.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nIn 2004, Jimenez accepted a coaching intern position at Stanford under head coach Tara VanDerveer, serving as the team's video coordinator among other responsibilities, such as organizing youth clinics and helping with recruiting evaluations. Jimenez then served as an assistant coach at San Diego State under head coach Beth Burns from 2005 to 2008. She helped rebuild the program, going from 4–25 in her first season to 19–13 in her third. \"Part of what I loved about San Diego State was taking a team that was almost non-existent in the basketball world and making a name for ourselves,\" Jimenez later explained.\n\n\n=== Cal State Monterey Bay ===\n\nOn June 12, 2008, Jimenez was named the head coach at Cal State Monterey Bay. She became one of the first two full-time head coaches in the athletic program's history alongside men's basketball coach Rob Bishop, who was hired the same day. At age 26, Jimenez also became the youngest women's basketball coach in the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA). She quickly hired Tina Samaniego, a former teammate in high school and junior college, as an assistant coach.\nInheriting a team which finished 3–24 the year before, Jimenez led the Otters to an 11–15 record in her first season as a head coach.\n\n\n=== UC Santa Barbara ===\nOn April 17, 2024, Jimenez was named the head coach at UC Santa Barbara, replacing Bonnie Henrickson.\n\n\n== Head coaching record ==\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJimenez has a wife named Chelsea and a daughter named Quinn.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCal State San Marcos Cougars bio\nCal State San Bernardino Coyotes bio\nCal State Monterey Bay Otters bio",

        "content": "\"Axiomatic\" is a science-fiction short story by Australian writer Greg Egan, first published in Interzone 41 in November 1990. The short story was included in the collection The Best of Greg Egan in 2020.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA man introducing himself as Mark Carver, illegally buys a certain kind of implant known as axiomatic. Just like the axioms in arithmetic, which are postulates creating a mathematical system, which not be questioned by that system, an axiomatic can alter a belief in the brain, for example to change religion or sexuality. This doesn't contradict free will as an axiomatic can be added or removed by choice and people can freely chose how to live with their new belief. Mark Carver uses the axiomatic to block his moral and ethic beliefs concerning murder for three days and uses them to shoot Anderson, the murderer of his late wife Amy. While doing so, he is overwhelmed by the pure certainty having replaced all his conflicting emotions, and later seeks to gain it again by using another axiomatic to convince himself, that the death of Amy and Anderson were totally meaningless.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe short story was nominated for the British SF Association Award in 1991 (as was Learning to be me, another of Egan's short stories). It reached the 11th place in the Reader Poll of the Locus Award in 1991 and the 2nd place in the Interzone Readers Poll in 1991.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nKaren Burnham, writing in the New York Review of Science Fiction, concludes after a discussion of the short stories Axiomatic, Mister Volition and Singleton, that „not everyone is as sanguine about the continuity of consciousness when making the transition to substances other than our organic brains nor so worried about the moral implications of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics.“ She claims that „Egan’s stories show a continuity of concern about these subjects that refuses superficial answers and instead examines them in depth.“\nKaren Burnham, writing in Strange Horizons, says that „the ending is tragically just, in a twisted way.“\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAxiomatic title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database",

Cricket has had its existence in the country since the 1750s, the sport gained a lot of popularity through the decades. But cricket has seen decline over the years, however it remains popular among the South Asian population of the country. The team is governed by Cricket Canada, which has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council since 1968. They qualified for their first World Cup at 1979 Cricket World Cup, after finishing as runners up of the 1979 ICC Trophy. The team did not play in the tournament again till 2003, they moved on to play in three editions in a row in 2003, 2007 and 2011.\n\n\n== Cricket World Cup Record ==\n\n\n=== World Cup Record (By Team) ===\n\n\n== 1979 World Cup ==\n\nAfter finishing as the runners-up of the 1979 ICC Trophy, Canada qualified for the World Cup alongside Sri Lanka. Led by Bryan Mauricette, the team lost all of their group stage matches. They played their first-ever ODI and World Cup match on 9 June against Pakistan which they lost by 8 wickets. In their second match, England defeated them by 8 wickets after restricting them to a low total of 45 runs.

        "content": "Portrait of Hermann Hillebrandt de Wedigh is an oil and tempera on oak painting completed in 1533 by Hans Holbein the Younger, now in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. It depicts a member of the Wedigh family of Cologne thought to be a merchant of the Steelyard in London.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThis small half-length has been described as \"one of the finest and most sympathetic portraits ever painted by Holbein.\" The subject stands directly facing the viewer, the left hand holding his buff-coloured gloves, and the right half hidden by the heavy dark-brown cloak. The manner in which the right hand is hidden inside a cloak is repeated in The poet Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (c. 1542). This cloak the folds of which are finely arranged and painted, has a black velvet collar and velvet at the wrists. The white shirt, partly open and showing the bare chest beneath, is tied in the front by long strings passed through a white button, and the embroidered collar is almost hidden by his beard. A flat black cap is on his head, of the type worn by all the Steelyard merchants in Holbein's portraits. The hair, beard, and moustache are light brown, \"the separate hairs being indicated with almost microscopic care.\" The eyes are blue, the right one larger than the left, the eyebrow raised. The right side of the face shows \"great charm and much sweetness of expression\" and the left appears \"sadder and more forbidding\".\nOn the plain blue background there is a Latin inscription at head-height, with the year and the sitter's age in gold letters: ANNO . 1533. // ÆTATIS SVÆ . 39. The signet ring on his index finger is enamelled in red, white, black and green, and in the circle around the coat of arms there are some letters now undecipherable. Unlike Holbein's other paintings of Steelyard merchants, this portrait and that of Derich Born (1533), have no letter/s or merchant's mark to identify the sitter.\nA related portrait, Hermann von Wedigh III (died 1560) (1532), now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York also has a raised eyebrow over the right eye which is larger than the left and the same coat of arms on a signet ring. \"Perhaps to engage the viewer in close study of the likenesses of the two men, or even to stress a common family trait, the artist has exaggerated the size of the right eye in each.\"\nThe two men have been identified as a members of the Wedigh family of Cologne by the coat of arms on their signet ring: a chevron surrounded by three willow leaves. Maximilian I granted this coat of arms to a \"Rheinlander\" named Heinrich von Wedigh (1440–1513) on 18 July 1503.  Several members of this patrician family were merchants at the Steelyard in London from 1480.\n\n\n== Identification ==\nThe subject of this painting may be an undocumented brother or cousin of Hermann III von Wedigh. He is traditionally called \"Hermann Hillebrandt Wedigh,\" but only his family name and age can be established. Hermann III von Wedigh's father, Hermann II, had, so far as we know, no other sons and no brothers, and although his sister Clara married first Philip Aberlinck and then Johannes Hillebrandt, no children are recorded from either marriage. The identification of this member of the family as \"Hermann Hillebrandt Wedigh\" is by no means certain.\n\n\n== Provenance ==\nThe Counts von Schönborn, Vienna, by 1746 until 1865; the banker, Barthold Suermondt, Aachen, until 1874.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of paintings by Hans Holbein the Younger\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPortrait of Hermann Hillebrandt de Wedigh at the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin",

In August 2017, Vladimir Kolokoltsev met with Dato Jammy to discuss the development of cooperation between the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and ASEAN counterparts.\nThe RBPF placed a high priority on strengthening border security in February 2017.

        "content": "\"Pride\" is a song by American country music singer Sara Evans. It was released on March 21, 2024, as the lead single to her eleventh studio album, Unbroke. Evans co-wrote the track with Madi Diaz and Sean McConnell, and co-produced it with Jeff Trott.\n\n\n== Content ==\nSara Evans wrote \"Pride\" with Madi Diaz and Sean McConnell. It marked her first release via a partnership with Melody Place Records and the singer's own Born to Fly imprint. Evans describes the song as the \"centerpiece\" for Unbroke, an album that chronicles recent events in her personal life from the beginning of spousal abuse to the reconciliation of her marriage and the couple restarting their lives together, as it \"details the early days of the couple's relationship turmoil\". It was written shortly after a January 2022 altercation with her husband Jay Barker, whom she had been separated from since April 2021 and had filed for divorce from in August 2021.\nIn a March 2024 interview, Evans stated that the couple had reconciled and are now living together again. As a result, Evans contemplated changing the perspective of \"Pride\" from first-person to third-person following the couple's reconciliation, but Barker encouraged her to keep the song as is because it was her story to tell.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for \"Pride\" premiered on March 27, 2024, and stars Evans' daughter Audrey Evans.\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\"Pride\" debuted at number 60 on the Billboard Canada Country chart dated April 13, 2024, becoming Evans' first single to chart there since \"Slow Me Down\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Abbé Denis Bizot (ca. 17th C. - ca. 1752) (alias l'Abbé Bizot) was a French Jansenist abbot, poet and doctor of the College of Sorbonne who, in addition to some original Latin verses, translated a handful of poems and hymns from French into Latin. Although his bibliography is limited, he was known for quality work. \n\n\n== Life ==\nDenis Bizot was worn sometime in the late 1600s and was a priest and attending the College of Sorbonne in Paris, France by 1705. However, he doesn't seem to have ever taught. In 1707, he translated the first canto of the poem Lutrin by Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux into Latin with no intentions of translating the others. However, he eventually showed it to Desperaux, who loved it, and commented that it was even better than the French. The quality of his translation attracted negative attention from local poets, however, and they had a mutual friend invite Bizot to a dinner they would also be attending without his knowledge.\nDuring the dinner, the jealous poets bet 50 crowns that Bizot could not translate the fifth canto as skillfully as he had done the first, calling it beginner's luck. Bizot accepted the bet as he needed the money and after he had calmed down from the confrontation, he felt overwhelmed by the challenge. However, he still completed his translation of the fifth canto in 1708 and won the bet. He is believed to have written the inscription on the engraving by Jacques-Nicolas Tardieu named The Pool at Bethesda around the year 1752, and he died sometime later while serving as a normal priest at Saint-Eustache.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Original Works ===\nArnaldi Tumulus (c.1694)\nIn Societatis Jesu Patres satyram viri clarissimi Despereaux de Divino Amore deme livido male carpentes.

It consists of four equal rectangles, two red and two blue, the upper left of which bears a small, tiled, centered, white star, with a large, white cross in the center touching all four sides of the flag. The white star stands for liberty and freedom, the red rectangles for the blood poured by the heroes of the revolt, and the white cross for the yearning of homeland redemption. Having been established in Lares by Puerto Rican revolutionaries 27 years before they adopted the current flag of Puerto Rico in New York, the flag is recognized as first flag of the island.",

One such is the west coast of Hispaniola found by Christopher Columbus, \"from whence at this time is brought most fine gold\".\nGold of Ophir: This was very rare gold of the highest purity.\nSome have pointed out that the queen mentioned in this verse is the Virgin Mary.\n\n\n== References ==",

The show is set in the days leading up to the night of Lincoln's assassination while watching Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre. The show portrays Mary as someone who longs to live a life away from politics and be a vaudeville performer, while Lincoln uses her as a beard to hide his sexuality, and is often away from home dealing with the issues of the Civil War, leaving her alone in the White House.\n\n\n== Production history ==\nThe play premiered Off-Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theatre on February 8, 2024, with previews beginning January 26, 2024. The show had a planned closing date of March 24, 2024, however due to high ticket sales and critical acclaim, the play extended twice, first from March 24 til May 2, 2024 and then until May 12, 2024. The title is taken from the LGBT slang term of gay men being referred to as a Mary.\nOn April 24, 2024, it was announced the show would transfer to Broadway for a limited twelve week run at the Lyceum Theatre. The show is written by Cole Escola and directed by Sam Pinkleton, and will mark Escola's Broadway debut as a performer and playwright. Previews are set to begin June 26, 2024 with a run scheduled from July 11, 2024, until September 15, 2024. The show features original music by Daniel Kluger and arrangements by David Dabbon. Scenic design is by the design collective knowns as dots with costumes by Astor Yang and Holly Pierson.\n\n\n== Original cast and characters ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nAbe Lincoln in Illinois\nThe Last of Mrs. Lincoln\nThe Day Lincoln Was Shot\nLincoln\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== 2024 Off-Broadway production ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n​Oh, Mary!​ at the Internet Broadway Database",

        "content": "The Shito Dolmen Cluster (志登支石墓群)  is an archaeological site with a  Yayoi period cemetery containing numerous dolmens, located in the city of Itoshima, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1954. \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Shito Dolmen Cluster is located  on a slightly elevated area in the alluvial plain on the left bank of the Zuibaiji River, which flows through the Itoshima Plain that extends to the west of the Fukuoka Plain, at the base of the Itoshima Peninsula that juts out into the Genkai Sea. It consists of ten dolmens lined up at intervals of one to two meters apart, about one meter higher in elevation than the surrounding paddy fields. The site was discovered in 1952, and during archaeological excavations the following year, eight burials were confirmed. Stone pillars support a flat or tortoise-shaped cap stone made of basalt or granite with a diameter of 1.5 to 2 meters and thickness of about 50-cm. The lower structure is a rectangular stone enclosure made of block stones, with a jar burial in a shallow earthen pit underneath. Grave goods included six obsidian stone arrowheads and four willow leaf-shaped polished stone arrowheads, thought to be made in the Korean Peninsula. These graves are estimated to date from the early to middle Yayoi period. The excavated artifacts are stored at the Itokoku History Museum.  \nThe site is approximately a 15-minute walk from Hatae Station on the JR Kyushu Chikuhi Line.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Fukuoka)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nItoshima Tourism home page(in Japanese)\nFukuoka Tourism Web(in Japanese)",

        "content": "UGC 6697 is a large irregular spiral galaxy with a bar located in the Leo constellation. It is located 378 million light-years from the solar system and has an estimated diameter of 205,000 thousand light-years. UGC 6697 is considered a starburst galaxy which produces high rates of star formation.\n\n\n== A possible jellyfish galaxy? ==\n\nUGC 6697 has a particular morphology. It is considered an edge-on galaxy and such has a long tidal tail with blue color and low surface brightness which stretches out northwest. This is in fact caused by dynamic pressure. It occurs when the galaxy plunges forward into the cluster, the pressure acts on the galaxy and penetrates through high speeds causing intracluster medium. In the process, the cooler gas is compressed and expelled from the galaxy's edge thus forming a trail. The gas trail extends 100 kpc which measures 326,000 thousand light-years in diameter. In the long run, the dynamic pressure will eventually strip the gas from the galaxy, rending it an anemic galaxy.\nAccording to observations from Chandra X-ray Observatory, it shows that more massive new stars have formed in compressed gas regions of UGC 6697 due to the result of increased dynamic stripping. These, however will explode into supernovas over the next 10 million years which its heat produces x-rays and optical light.\n\n\n== Companion galaxy ==\nUGC 6697 has one companion galaxy which is CGCG 097-087N or 2MASX J11434983+1958343. It is located 379 million light-years away and also shows signs of distortion caused by dynamic pressure. Further studies show that the two galaxies might have interacted in the past.\n\n\n== Supernova ==\nType II supernova, SN 1986C was discovered in UGC 6697 on March 5, 1986, by B. Leibundgut and B. Binggeli of European Southern Observatory, La Silla. The supernova was magnitude of 18.\n\n\n== Group membership ==\nUGC 6697 is a member of the Leo Cluster which is made up of at least 70 galaxies. The other members include NGC 3805, NGC 3837, the brightest cluster member NGC 3842, NGC 3860, NGC 3883, NGC 3884, NGC 3919, NGC 3929, NGC 3937, NGC 3940 and NGC 3954. Other galaxies included in the Leo Cluster are radio galaxy, NGC 3862 and IC 2955.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Hospital (Chinese: 医院, Pinyin: yīyuàn) is a dystopian science-fiction novel by Chinese writer Han Song and the first part of the Hospital trilogy (Chinese: 医院三部曲, Pinyin: yīyuàn sān bù qǔ). The novel describes a world with an extreme misuse of the healthcare system. Patients are not properly informed about their diagnosis, told lies or are exploited. The Chinese version was published by Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House (Chinese: 上海文艺术出, Pinyin: shànghǎi wén yìshù chū) on 1 Juni 2016. The English version was published by Amazon Crossing on 1 March 2023. The translation was done was Michael Berry.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter a catastrophe on Earth, buddhism became the primary belief of humanity. The spaceship SS Mahamayuri (after Sanskrit महामायूरी Mahāmāyūrī for „Great Peacock“) travels to Mars to search for another incarnation of Buddha, but instead discovers a hospital and peacock-like creatures attacking and then destroying the spaceship. Afterwards, many more hospitals are found everywhere in the Solar System. (The prologue is not referenced again and often interpreted purely as a metaphor.)\nDuring a business trip to C City, Yang Wei, a songwriter from Corporation B, drinks a bottle of mineral water in his hotel, gets a strong stomach pain and falls asleep for three days. The hotel staff breaks into his room and transports him to the hospital, where the doctor treating him immediately knows about the mineral water. Yang Wei is told by a nurse, that the entire hotel is unser surveillance and that the hospital has access to all tapes due to security concerns. For his examination, Yang Wei is brought into the dirty basement filled with moss and gets told, that the hospital demands a proof of his faith in form of money. Just recently, a patient mistrusted the hospital, handed over tea instead of urine and saw the positive result coming back as a proof of scam, severely angering the hospital. Yang Wei encounters multiple patients who themselves came back extremely angry, including one who paid a million dollars and one who had to pay for additional surgeries, that were neither necessary nor wished by him. Yang Wei realizes that people starting to pay for treatment can't leave before it is concluded as they would otherwise waste the money already paid. Therefore, the hospital can keep them as long as they wish by just postponing the end of the treatment and getting more money. Sister Jiang vists him to tell him about needing surgery after considering the results of his examination, but doesn't want to tell them to him, because it's only the business of the hospital. She invites Yang Wei to put his head on her lap to sleep and then treats him like a baby, continuing to call him „Little Yang“. When being told, that pain in surgery is necessary to gain happiness in health, Yang Wei has a little panic attack. When returning, he sees his doctor running out of ink and instead using fresh blood to write. Sister Jiang tells him, that another person drank the mineral water at the hotel, but before she can leave, an angry former patient returns to detonate a bomb in the hospital, killing her. In her last moments, she hands Yang Wei over to ten-year-old Tao. Yang Wei starts to believe that everything weird he has seen yet is only the manifestation of some dark secret. Yang Wei's boss visits to tell him, that due to good relations of Corporation B with C City, it is good that he will stay in the hospital longer. Yang Wei begins a deep dive into the system behind the hospital, including an underground world of patients, a sentient being living in his stomach and the hospital spanning not only the Earth, but also the cosmos.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHospital achieved an average rating of 7,5/10 on Douban.\nIan Mond, writing in the Locus magazine, that „when viewed from a pre-COVID perspective, the novel’s central concerns seem to become about imperialism and authoritarianism“. Han Song „tackles these broad themes“ in „inven­tive ways“. Ian Mond further writes, that despite admiring the novel, it's one he „struggled to love“ due to it „seem[ing] overly long“, the „first third becom[ing] increasingly less engaging“ or „de­piction of women“ being „hard to digest“. On the other hand „the novel’s final third is a remarkable display of the absurd and the cosmic, with what feels like a new, startling idea on every page.“\nAnother reception by Subashini Navaratnam was published in Strange Horizons on 29 January 2024. It claims, that the novel „feels universal in its depiction of medical bureaucracy“ and „reads like slapstick Dostoyevsky“. The translator Michael Berry „has done a good job“ transporting this feeling. The premises in the novel are „depressingly and familiarly fascist“, but „remain open to discussion“. It is „far from an easy read, despite its relatively short chapters and eminently pithy and quotable lines.“\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHospital title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database (English)\nHospital title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database (Chinese)\nHospital on Douban (Chinese)",

        "content": "Arab fascism is a blend of Arab nationalism and fascism.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ideology emerged after World War I and grew during the interwar period. Arab fascists were heavily antisemitic and anti-Turkish. Arab fascists became more Antisemitic after 1948, where Arab fascism grew with support from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Works such as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion also gained in popularity. Arab fascism first grew in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine, and Egypt. Some Arab fascists incorporated Islamism into their nationalism, while some embraced secularism.\nBa'athism was described as being inspired by Arab fascism, although with the addition of socialism. Michel Aflaq had purchased a copy of The Myth of the Twentieth Century.\nNotable Arab fascists include Amin al-Husseini, Abd al-Razzaq al-Dandashi, Saib Shawkat, Taha al-Hashimi, Rashid Ali al-Gaylani. Gamal Abdel Nasser was accused of being a fascist by his opponents, and Saddam Hussein was described as a fascist.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nJankowski, James P. (1975).

        "content": "Coming of Age is a Canadian dramatic television film, which was released on the pay-per-view channel Viewers Choice in 1993. The film stars Marion Gilsenan as Jane McKenzie, an elderly widow who takes a number of boarders into her home to make ends meet after the death of her husband.\nThe cast includes Jan Rubeš as Tomas Havel, a retired handyman who becomes a new love interest for Jane; Bernard Behrens and Jennifer Phipps as Arthur and Ruth Stone, a couple faced with Ruth's cognitive decline due to Alzheimer disease; and Julie Stewart as Jane's daughter Heather; as well as Tom Barnett, Ardon Bess, Esther Hockin and Jacelyn Holmes in supporting roles.\nThe film was produced by Breakthrough Films in conjunction with CKVR-TV, and premiered on Viewers Choice in December 1993. After both Behrens and Phipps won Gemini Awards for their performances in early 1995, the film was subsequently rebroadcast in December 1995 by the stations of the CanWest Global System.\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nJohn Haslett Cuff of The Globe and Mail gave the film a moderately favourable review, calling it \"a better-than-average TV film\" that was \"very well acted and sensitively directed\". He concluded that \"it's all so gently and earnestly done that it seems churlish to harp further on deficiencies which are so common to the genre. It is important that Canadian TV stations and independent producers continue to take the initiative in finding ways to produce indigenous dramatic projects. And if the quality is no worse than what is produced by the CBC and other networks, that's more a criticism of the big guys who have far greater resources, because they set the standards.\"\nJim Bawden of the Toronto Star called it \"a welcome surprise...beautifully acted by a mostly elderly cast and very moving in depicting the sorrows and pain that come with aging.\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nComing of Age at IMDb",

        "content": "The Count of Charny is a feudal title that originated in the village of Charny-sur-Meuse in northeastern France. The village is located near the city of Verdun, which was the site of major battles during World War I.\n\n\n== History ==\nCharny-sur-Meuse was originally the seat of a seigneurial lordship within the Duchy of Lorraine. Through faithful service to the Dukes of Lorraine, the lordship was eventually raised to the rank of county or countship.\nThe village itself has little historical significance, but it is situated on the Meuse River, which becomes part of the larger Maas River. The city of Maastricht on the Maas River was the location where the important Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1992, establishing key rules for the European Union.\nThe Cathedral of Verdun is one of the region's most impressive religious edifices. Verdun, along with Toul and Metz, formed the Three Bishoprics that played a pivotal role in the religious wars of the early 17th century across Europe. Until 1766, Lorraine was an independent state owing allegiance to both France and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe title Count of Charny was revived and sold by Burke's Peerage in 1999, with the purchase including just over 1/4 acre of noble land, particularly an orchard. The revival documents were signed by Harold Brooks-Baker of Burke's Peerage.\nThe title is best known from the 1853 novel The Countess of Charny by Alexandre Dumas, part of his series of books about the French Revolution. Dumas' most famous work was The Three Musketeers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSeigneur d'Aubigny\nDuke of Châtellerault\n\n\n== References ==",

After graduating from high school, Ivask went to Moscow, where he studied at the painting studio of Konstantin Korovin. He wanted to study art, but he was not accepted at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture due to his age. He graduated as an archivist from the Moscow Archaeological Institute in 1910.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIvask chose to specialize in bibliography instead of art, and he was fascinated by bookplates. In addition, he designed title pages, headers, book covers, and vignettes. Ivask's works were printed from 1905 to 1918. Thirty-five bookplates are known to have been created by Ivask.\nHe founded the Moscow Bookplate Society (Russian: Московское общество любителей книжных знаков) in 1905. He contributed to the creation of the Russian Book Chamber, edited a magazine, and was the head of the department of rare publications at the Rumyantsev Museum and a member of the bibliographic commission of the State Publishing House.\nIvask died of tuberculosis in Tartu in 1922.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gladiator is a board wargame originally published by Battleline in 1979 in the two-game boxed set Circus Maximus along with the game Chariot Racing. Both games were bought by Avalon Hill and published as separate games in 1981.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGladiator is a board wargame in which each player generates their own gladiator, using a pool of points to assign scores for training, strength, agility, constitution, combat capabilities and armor. The resultant characters are then pitted against each other in a battle for survival.\n\nIn the basic game, the only type of gladiator available is the secutor, armed with gladius and scutum.\nIn the advanced game, the retiarius, armed with net and trident, is also available.\nIn the campaign game, players control rich Romans who own stables of gladiators. In this version, the winning player is not the one who wins the most matches, but the one who accumulates the most money through betting on the matches.\nThe game components include a 16\" x 11\" hex grid map and 12 gladiator counters that fit into plastic stands.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nGladiator, designed by Michael E. Matheny, was published in 1979 by Battleline Publications, a subsidiary of Heritage Models. (Gladiator and Chariot Racing were sold together under the name Circus Maximus.) When Battleline was sold to Avalon Hill in October 1979, the new owners published the two components of Circus Maximus as two separate games. While Chariot Racing was renamed Circus Maximus, Gladiator was published under its original title, featuring artwork by Cathy Chastain, Dale Scheaffer, and Mark Wheatley.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn Issue 29 of Dragon, game designer Tim Kask commented, \"The Gladiator system appears rather complex, but seems pretty accurate. I feel that if the two players were very comfortable with the rules and\nmechanics, it would be fairly accurate and exciting.\" Kask warned, \"Gladiator is not designed for the novice or beginner.\"\nIn Issue 6 of Simulacrum, Joseph Scoleri reviewed the Battleline edition, and thought it was \"a somewhat awkward companion [of Chariot Racing] due to its less intuitive play and more detailed mechanics.\" Five issues later, Scoleri reviewed the Avalon Hill edition and commented \"Gladiator offers a nice middle ground between miniatures and board gaming.\"\n\n\n== Reference ==",

Descriptions vary.\nThe Shin Bet (also called in various sources \"General Security Service\" or \"Israel Security Agency\") uses it, together with other methods, for interrogation of Palestinian detainees. Often Shin Bet and the Office of the State Attorney of Israel argues that milder methods of shabeh are \"security measures\", rather than torture. In 2000 Jessica Montell reported that a 1998 opinion survey by B'Tselem found that 76% if Israelis agreed that shabeh constitutes a torture, however only 27% opposed to its common use and 35% more approved its use in special, \"ticking bomb\" cases.\nIn September 1999, Israel's High Court of Justice considered several petitions that contested the legality of the interrrogation methods employed by Shin Beth, including shabeh and in a unanimous ruling all methods of physical force, including holding in the shabeh position were outlawed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nStress position\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Port of Santander, Cantabria (Spain), is located in the Cantabrian Sea, specifically in the Bay of Santander, in the municipalities of Santander, Camargo and Marina de Cudeyo. It is managed by the Port Authority of Santander, whose current president is Francisco Martín Gallego, under the public entity Ports of the State and in turn administered by the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda. It belongs to the maritime province of Santander (ST). Santander District (ST-4).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of Santander and its port are closely linked from the beginning, since the construction of the port led to the growth of the original population center around it. The port of Santander has also promoted the development of the city, being today one of the most important economic engines of Cantabria. The special link between the port and the city has been evident since the 50s in urban planning, as the City of Santander seeks port land without current use to undertake major projects.\n\n\n=== Portus Victoriae Iuliobrigensium ===\n\nAt the end of the Cantabrian Wars, specifically in 19 B.C., the Romans founded the port of Portus Victoriae, which some authors identify with Santander and others with Santoña. Thanks to the protection of the bay, the location of this new city and port was unmatched. Initially, the main activity of the port, and the reason for its construction, was the export of minerals to other parts of the Empire.\n\n\n=== Middle and Modern Ages ===\n\nIn 1296 the Hermandad de las Marismas was formed, of which Santander is a part.\nIn 1494 the Consulate of Burgos was created, which later allowed wool traffic in the port of Santander, positively affecting the local economy.\nIn the 16th century, Santander was one of the fundamental ports for the Navy of Castile and for the trade of the Kingdom of Castile. In 1570, King Philip II declared the port a naval base for the Cantabrian Sea. In 1639, the Royal Shipyard of Guarnizo (Real Astillero de Guarnizo) was founded, the seed of what is now Astander, in the current municipality of El Astillero.\n\n\n=== Trade with the New World ===\nIn 1765 the Royal Decree of Free Trade was enacted, allowing Santander to trade with the Spanish colonies in the New World. Twenty years later, in 1785, the Consulate of Santander was created. Thanks to these two measures, colonial trade increased and the city prospered until it became one of the most important port cities.\nIn 1801, the maritime province of Santander was created.\nIn 1893, the steamship Cabo Machichaco, docked at the Maliaño dock in the port of Santander, exploded. Its cargo, composed of dynamite and sulfuric acid, burned for hours before exploding.\nWith the loss of the last colonies, the port lost its main resource, a fact that was felt in the economy of the city.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nOn August 11, 1918, the Santander Bonded Warehouse was founded, one of the first in the country.\nIn the mid-20th century, it was decided that, in order to increase capacity and competitiveness, it was necessary to move the port's tasks from the city center to another location, which would be an area of marshland in the Bay of Santander after it had been filled in. The site chosen to carry out the filling and, therefore, the new core of the port would be the Ría de Raos, on the municipal boundary between Santander and Camargo.\nIn 1985 the first Raos piers were inaugurated and four years later, in 1989, work was completed on the Raos north breakwater and the Ro-Ro and Ro-Pax ferry terminal. Later, with more modern and appropriate facilities, the port began to handle automobile traffic, one of its main activities.\nIn 1995, the construction of the Raos central breakwater began, which was completed two years later. In addition, a plan was drawn up for the use of the port spaces and the future organization and operation of the port.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nAs a result of the continuous problems and complaints caused to the population near the port facilities by the handling of the large volumes of coal arriving at the port. In 2005, the process of building a bulk cargo terminal to serve the port began. After a long journey, the terminal was finally put into operation in June 2012, not without controversy.\n\n\n=== Problems of draft ===\nThe bay of Santander suffers progressive silting due to the sediments that arrive from the rivers that discharge their waters into it. This has made it necessary to periodically dredge the entrance channel to the bay, which is used by ships to reach the port, located in the western part of the estuary. Even so, the bay's own draft limitations mean that larger ships cannot access the port, which has been to its detriment in favor of other nearby ports, such as Bilbao or Gijón. For decades, the need to build an outer harbor outside the bay has been considered in order not to stagnate the growth and competitiveness of the port, although the project has been discarded several times due to the high costs involved in building a new port and the environmental problems it would cause. Thus, the fact that the port is located within a bay, which was a great advantage in past centuries due to the protection it gave to ships, is now a disadvantage due to the impossibility of the port's growth.\nThe future logistics platform of Llano de la Pasiega is the way the port will have to solve the problems of increasing capacity to meet new traffic and the growth of current traffic, given that there is no possibility of creating an outer port in Santander and once any new landfill in the bay has been ruled out.\n\n\n=== Future projects ===\nThe Singular Project of Regional Interest (PSIR) of Llano de La Pasiega, a large logistics area planned in the municipality of Piélagos that would facilitate the expansion of vehicle traffic and solve the space limitations that the port currently has. The project is promoted by the Government of Cantabria and the Santander Port Authority.\nExtremadura frigate permanent floating museum.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\n\n=== Access ===\nS-10 from Bilbao and France.\nA-67 from Palencia, Burgos and Asturias.\n\nBy rail:\nRailroad access is by two single non-electrified tracks, one Iberian-gauge and the other metre-gauge. Both lines are managed by Adif up to the physical and functional connection point with the port's railway network. This limit is located under the viaduct of the S-10 highway and the Adif lines run parallel to it.\nThe Iberian-gauge branch line starts at the Muriedas freight terminal, which is located on the Palencia-Santander line, between the Muriedas Bahía and Nueva Montaña stops.\n\nThe Raos piers are connected to the Santander-Bilbao metric-gauge line, through line 774 of the Maliaño La Vidriera-Puerto de Raos Red Ferroviaria de Interés General. It is a 3.5 km long single track line without electrification with blocking in shunting regime.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Wharfs and singular buildings ===\nFrom east to west and north to south:\n\n\n==== Gamazo Dock ====\n\nThis is a dry dock designed by Arturo Clemente in 1885 with dimensions of 132 m in length and 15 m in breadth. This facility of the Junta de Obras del Puerto remained in service from 1908 to 1989 and is currently integrated in the Gamazo Park. In its vicinity is also located:\n\nCantabrian Maritime Museum.\nOceanographic Center (Santander).\nPalacio de Festivales de Cantabria.\nSuperior Technical School of Nautical.\nSpecialized High Performance Sailing Center ''Príncipe Felipe''.\nPlanetarium.\n\n\n==== Molnedo Dock, Puertochico ====\nThis great project was designed in the 19th century by José de Lequerica, it was built to facilitate the work of the fishing boats. In the 1940s it changed from being the fishing port of the Cantabrian capital to being a marina, moving the fishing activity to the current Barrio Pesquero.\n\n\n==== Calderón Wharf ====\n\nOn August 12, 1821 (1820 according to other authors), the City Council of Santander signed an agreement with Guillermo Antonio Calderón, a native of Soto Iruz, in the Valley of Toranzo (Cantabria), by which it made him the concessionaire to build a wharfon his own account, which would eventually receive its name as Calderón Wharf (Muelle de Calderón), and which would continue the work of the then existing docks, extending them from their easternmost point at that time, in front of Martillo Street (Calle del Martillo, whose name came from the shape of the end of the breakwater that continued the street, and which today is officially Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola Street -who would not be born until ten years later-), to what is now Lope de Vega Street. Calderón's commitment was to begin work in the spring of 1822, continuing until its completion \"without raising a hand\". At present, the name Calderón wharf corresponds to the one that extends from the Grúa de Piedra to the Club Marítimo, with an approximate length of two hundred and seventy (270) meters.\nThis agreement breaks a period of inactivity in the Santander docks that began in 1794, after the \"Plan of the docks of the city of Santander and its new population\" of the Captain of Frigate Agustín de Colosía, commissioned by the Royal Consulate of Sea and Land of Santander, but which met with the final opposition of both this body and the City Council of Santander itself regarding its proposed widening.\nThe \"Plan of the New Docks and New Town of the city of Santander\", with the title \"Plan showing the variations for the continuation of the project of works for the Dock, docks and new town of this City\", was drawn in 1821 by the later architect José Peterrade, from Cádiz and then Master Builder of the municipality of Santander, in response to a Royal Order of 13 December 1821, and the works contained in it were then budgeted at the amount of one million eight hundred thousand reals. The plan already included the Media Luna (today's Plaza de Cañadío) and another square that should have been called Plaza de la Constitución, which is today's Plaza de Pombo. Copies of the plan are preserved in the Cantabrian Maritime Museum and the Municipal Library of Santander, as well as in some private collections.\nThe works on the docks were completed in 1825, in 1826 the paving of the new square began and in 1827 the first house on the dock was built from Martillo Street (that is, on the right half of the current Banco de Santander building). This house would be the home of Guillermo Calderón himself (costing him quite a few arguments with the City Council to obtain authorization for its construction), and no traces of it remain since on October 6, 1880, it was destroyed by fire, there being evidence that the Café Suizo and the Círculo de Recreo, two essential social scenarios in 19th-century Santander, were installed in it. In 1837 most of the buildings projected on the first line of the pier were already built, as reflected in the plan of Lieutenant José María Mathé, of that year 1837.\n\nSantander Royal Maritime Club.

        "content": "On 14 February 1987, 47-year-old cake shop proprietor Lee Juay Heng (李锐兴 Lǐ Ruìxīng) was stabbed to death by three men during a robbery bid in Hougang, Singapore. The three robbers - Luah Kang Hai (赖江海 Lài Jiānghǎi), Tan Joo Cheng (陈裕清 Chén Yùqīng) and Ong Ah Lek (王亚厉 Wáng Yàlì) - were all arrested and charged with murdering Lee during the robbery. The court proceedings in the case concluded with both Ong and Luah convicted of lesser charges of attempted armed robbery and imprisoned with caning, while Tan himself was sentenced to death in 1990 for stabbing Lee to death in spite of his claim of intending to rob but not to kill Lee.\n\n\n== Murder ==\nOn 14 February 1987, a cake shop proprietor was found murdered outside his second-storey flat at Hougang.\nLee Juay Heng, aged 47 and a father of four, died from a stab wound to his throat. It was reported that Lee was possibly attacked while unlocking the entrance to his flat, and while he was bleeding profusely, Lee tried to use his home telephone to call for help but as the telephone was out of order, and he thus staggered to the public telephone booth on the ground floor, where he was found collapsed beside the phone booth. Lee's wife, who was at home at the time and witnessed her husband being mortally wounded, reported the matter to the police, and she told the investigators that she never knew why her husband, reportedly a well-known character of the neighbourhood who had no enemies, was attacked. Friends described Lee as an easygoing person who was often polite towards people around him.\nLee's death was classified as murder, and the police were unable to determine the motive of the killing at first hand. A police spokesperson, Assistant Superintendent of Police Chan Choo Giap told the media that the murder weapon was believed to be a knife, but the murder weapon was not located as of the time when the media conference was held.\n\n\n== Arrest of suspects ==\nOn 26 February 1987, two weeks after the murder of Lee Juay Heng, an unemployed 34-year-old inmate from a drug rehabilitation centre at Sembawang was arrested for the murder case, after the police received an informant's tip-off regarding two possible suspects behind the crime, and two men were arrested; the 34-year-old inmate was found to be involved while the other was not responsible for the crime and was released thereafter. The following day after the inmate's arrest, his 32-year-old accomplice (also jobless) was also caught in a police raid, and the police also initiated further investigations to trace the whereabouts of a missing third accomplice.\nOn 28 February 1987, the first two suspects, 34-year-old Tan Joo Cheng and 32-year-old Ong Ah Lek, were charged with murder, and they were subsequently held in remand to undergo further investigations and await trial.\nThe third accomplice was eventually identified as a Singaporean citizen named Luah Kang Hai (alias Ah Tee), and subsequently, on 15 March 1987, he was placed on the police's wanted list as a suspect of the robbery-murder. 32-year-old Luah was eventually arrested on 27 March 1987, and he was charged in court a day later with the murder of Lee Juay Heng, hence becoming the third and final suspect to be indicted for the case.\n\n\n== Trial proceedings ==\n\n\n=== Murder trial hearing ===\n\nOn 12 April 1989, the three perpetrators - Ong Ah Lek, Tan Joo Cheng and Luah Kang Hai - claimed trial to a single charge of murdering Lee Juay Heng back in 1987. The trial was presided over by both Justice L P Thean (Thean Lip Ping) and Judicial Commissioner Chao Hick Tin of the High Court.\nThe case of the prosecution, led by Ismail Hamid, adduced the statements of the trio to portray the second accused Ong as the mastermind of the murder. Ong was said to have suggested to a friend that they should be robbing Lee, since he owned an expensive branded car and had a lot of cash in his possession. However, the friend Kho Yak Meng did not agree to join the robbery and had no interest in committing the crime. Even so, Kho, who worked as a hawker, introduced the first accused Tan to Ong, and Tan would join Ong into committing the robbery. Afterwards, Tan would rope in the third accused Luah Kang Hai to join them in robbing Lee. It was also the prosecution's contention that Tan was responsible for stabbing Lee to death, and they referred to a statement of Tan where he mentioned stabbing Lee during a fierce struggle and only learned of Lee's death through the local Chinese newspaper Lianhe Wanbao. During the course of trial, the trio denied murdering Lee, especially Tan who claimed he never had the intent to cause Lee to die from the stabbing.\nAt one point, the trial was delayed due to one of the defence lawyers needing to attend his father's funeral, after the lawyer's father died while his son was representing Ong in his defence.\n\n\n=== Sentencing of Ong Ah Lek ===\nHalfway throughout the trial, the prosecution decided to no longer prosecute one of the defendants, Ong Ah Lek, for murder and thus amended his murder charge to a lesser offence of attempted armed robbery. With the murder charge against him dropped, Ong no longer faced the death penalty for murdering Lee Juay Heng, which left both Luah Kang Hai and Tan Joo Cheng to remain facing trial for murder.\nOn 20 April 1989, Ong was allowed to plead guilty, and was sentenced to jail for six years and given 18 strokes of the cane. Both Judicial Commissioner Chao and Justice Thean agreed that there was no direct evidence proving Ong's involvement or culpability behind Lee's death, but Justice Thean, who passed sentence on Ong, stated that the court should not take a lenient view on the murder of Lee which resulted from Ong's planning of the robbery, and hence imposed a six-year jail term with caning (18 strokes) on Ong. The sentence was backdated to February 1987.\n\n\n=== Defence of Tan Joo Cheng and Luah Kang Hai ===\nAfter the reduction of Ong's murder charge, both Luah Kang Hai and Tan Joo Cheng continued to stand trial for the murder of Lee Juay Heng, and the two judges ruled on the same date of Ong's sentencing that both Tan and Luah had a case to answer and called for both the remaining accused to give their defence.\nMore than a year later, the trial resumed on 6 July 1990. Tan, who was said to have surrendered himself in order to not continue his detention in a drug rehabilitation centre, stated in his defence that after the trio began their plan to rob, he tailed Lee all the way to his flat, and he planned all along to use the knife to threaten Lee rather than causing him any harm to begin with. Tan stated that he and Lee got into a struggle when Lee was unlocking the door, and during the struggle itself, Lee accidentally lost his balance and the knife thus plunged into Lee's neck while he slipped and fell. Overall, Tan's contention was that he never meant to kill Lee, whose death he only found out through the local Chinese newspaper Lianhe Wanbao.\nAs for Luah, his defence was that he only acted as a look-out and he never took part in either the stabbing or the restraining of the victim. Afterwards, the judgement was reserved on 11 July 1990 and scheduled to be delivered on a later date.\n\n\n=== Verdict ===\nOn 21 August 1990, both Judicial Commissioner Chao Hick Tin and Justice L P Thean delivered their final verdict, with Justice Thean pronouncing the decision in court.\nIn the judgement, Justice Thean found that Tan's defence of accidental stabbing was ought to be rejected, given that it was unbelievable to accept that Lee was stabbed due to him inadvertently falling forward into the knife held in Tan's hand, and there was no factual basis to support Tan's contention. The judges felt that it was more likely that Tan had deliberately knifed Lee on the neck and caused the single stab wound that was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and hence his actions warranted a guilty verdict of murder. On the other hand, the trial court determined that Luah was not present at the murder scene when the fatal stabbing took place, and did not participate in the struggle between Lee and Tan, and Luah was thus not held culpable for killing Lee as compared to Tan.\nIn conclusion, 37-year-old Tan Joo Cheng was found guilty of murdering Lee Juay Heng and sentenced to death by hanging, while 36-year-old Luah Kang Hai was acquitted of murder and therefore spared the death sentence. Instead, Luah was found guilty of a lesser charge of attempted armed robbery and sentenced to six years' imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane, and Luah's jail term was backdated to the date of his arrest in March 1987.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn 12 February 1992, the Court of Appeal heard Tan Joo Cheng's appeal, and dismissed it thereafter. The three judges - Chief Justice Yong Pung How, Justice S. Rajendran and Justice Goh Joon Seng - agreed that there was sufficient evidence to prove that Tan had the intention to stab Lee Juay Heng during the robbery bid, such that the injury caused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and it was neither accidental nor unintentional. In the verdict, Justice Rajendran cited that, \"Even if an accused intended to inflict only a relatively minor injury, if the injury that he in fact inflicted pursuant to that intention was an injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the provisions of cl(c) of s 300 would be attracted.\" On these grounds, the appellate court unanimously dismissed Tan's appeal, and further condemning him to hang for the crime.\nSince then, Tan Joo Cheng was hanged in Changi Prison on an unknown date for murdering Lee Juay Heng.\nIn the aftermath, the judgement of Tan's appeal was known to be one of the iconic cases that scrutinized the definition of murder under Section 300(c) of the Penal Code, which defines an act of murder as one of intentionally inflicting a fatal injury on the victim(s), and it also highlighted the difficulties and implications of convicting an offender of murder under this section, especially if the said offender did not have the intent to cause death or the bodily injury that resulted in death.\nAlso, a law journal also covered the case in July 1992, where it concerned the application of Section 34 of the Penal Code, which laid out the doctrine of common intention, where several people involved in a crime was liable to be held responsible for any acts done by one of the co-accused in the case. The author, K. L. Koh, stated that the facts of the case made it more likely that Tan's accomplices Luah Kang Hai and Ong Ah Lek should be held accountable for murder by their common intention of committing armed robbery, since Ong masterminded the crime and instructed both Luah and Tan to initiate the hold-up, and Luah himself was aware of the knife carried by Tan and expected the knife to be used during the commission of robbery, and both men's actions were indirectly connected to the outcome of Tan stabbing Lee to death.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCapital punishment in Singapore\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) is an organisation within NATO with the aim of facilitating the development of emerging and disruptive dual-use technologies.\nThrough a network of accelerator sites and test centres, DIANA aims to be a conduit between universities, industry, governments, and technology companies from across the NATO alliance. The companies that are successfully selected from a call for proposals receive funding from the NATO Innovation Fund.\nThe DIANA Board of Directors is responsible for governance of the organisation and has representatives from all NATO nations.\nDIANA's first managing director is Professor Deeph Chana.\n\n\n== History ==\nMembers of the NATO alliance agreed to the creation of DIANA at the North Atlantic Council in Brussels on 14 June 2021.\nOn 7 April 2022, NATO foreign ministers approved the Charter for DIANA. In the same month the NATO Advisory Group on Emerging and Disruptive Technologies, chaired by Professor Deeph Chana, released its second annual report examining the development of DIANA.\nNATO Heads of State and Government at the North Atlantic Council in Madrid on 29 June 2022 officially endorsed the Charter and agreed to the initial locations of the test centres and accelerator sites for DIANA.\nOn 30 March 2023, NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană and UK Minister for Defence Procurement Alex Chalk opened the first regional office of DIANA at the Imperial College London Innovation Hub, based in White City.\nOn 19 June 2023, DIANA became operational and instigated its first call for proposals. The three pilot challenge programmes announced were centred on innovative dual-use technologies for energy resilience, undersea sensing and surveillance, and secure information sharing.\nOn 30 November 2023, DIANA announced the first 44 companies selected out of 1,300 applicants from its call for proposals. The companies came from a range of fields such as robotics, ocean sensors, quantum technologies, and energy-generating textiles. Each company will receive a grant of €100,000 to be put towards expenses such as salaries, rent, and equipment.\nBy 14 March 2024, DIANA had 23 accelerator sites and 182 test centres. The organisation stated that it aimed to reach full operational capacity by 2025.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Physcia cinerea is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Physciaceae. It was described as a new species in 1990 by the Swedish lichenologist Roland Moberg. The lichen is found in Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 m (8,200 and 13,100 ft), typically on sun-exposed rocks in páramo habitat. It has an orbicular to irregularly shaped thallus up to 3 cm in diameter, comprising narrow lobes up to 1 mm wide. The thallus is grey to dark grey, while the underside is white to brownish, with abundant rhizines of the same colour. Apothecia (fruiting bodies), which are usually abundant, are lecanorine in form and up to 1.5 mm in diameter. They have a dark brown to black disc that lacks pruina. Both the upper cortex and the medulla of the lichen are K+ (yellow). Secondary metabolites (lichen products) in the species include atranorin, zeorin, and leucotylin.\n\n\n== References ==",

They played at Church Road until 1971 when the club suffered huge financial problems and struggled to field 11 players. Matches between St Lappans and Clash helped grow popularity in the Little Island area and Island Albion returned under the name of Little Island Athletic. They played on a field that was owned by then player Bill Cogan. The youth setup was the key to the clubs success in the 80s. They went the 1989–1990 season unbeaten, beating Coachford 4–1 on penalties in the cup final and gaining promotion to the premier division for the first time.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nCork Athletic Union League\nPremier A - Winners 1998\nDivision 1b - Winners 1991,1997\nDivision 2 - Winners 1986\nCounty Cup - Winners 1991,1994,1997\nPresidents Cup Winners 1985\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMunster Senior Leagues website\nCork Schoolboys Leagues website\nCork Womans and Schoolgirls Leagues website\nCork Youth Leagues website",

        "content": "Eighth Air Force, subtitled \"Air War Over Europe, 1942–45\", is a card-based wargame published by GMT Games in 1995 that simulates the air combat between Allied and German aircraft during the final three years of World War II. This was the second game in the series Down in Flames, and required the previous game in the series, Rise of the Luftwaffe, in order to play.\n\n\n== Description ==\nEighth Air Force is a card game for 2–8 players in which one side controls bombers and their fighter escorts, while the other side controls fighters and antiaircraft defenses.\nThe game components include 128 die-cut counters representing pilots, altitude, drop tanks and hit markers, and 132-card deck used for aircraft.\nVarious scenarios can be played, including the British Dambusters Raid of 1943; the German 1942-43 Stalingrad Airlift; the Eighth Air Force Schweinfurt Raids of 1943; and the Allied raids on V1 and V-2 rocket bases..\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nIn 1993, GMT Games published Rise of the Luftwaffe, a card-based wargame designed by Gene Billingsley, Rodger B. MacGowan, and Dan Verssen that was billed as the first in the Down in Flames series of games. Two years later, GMT released Eighth Air Force, the second in the series, also created by Billingsley, MacGowan and Versen. MacGowan supplied the artwork. The second game was not a standalone game but an expansion of Rise of the Luftwaff — the first game was needed in order to play the second game.\nBetween 2001 and 2017, GMT would publish another ten games in the Down in Flames series.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn Issue 22 of Paper Wars Dav Townsend noted, \"The system uses cards, like Avalon Hill's Up Front or Naval War. Avoiding both the former's rule excesses and the latter's trivialization of history, the Down in Flames series provides a clever, fast-paced flavoring of World War II dogfighting.\" Townsend concluded, \"Eighth Air Force needs a shade more work to make it excellent, but as is, it s easily worth the money.\"\nIn Issue 8 of Simulacrum, Joseph Scoleri noted \"As one might expect from such a system, the emphasis is on flavor rather than simulation. Nonetheless, the attention to historical detail and entertaining gameplay make the games attractive to nearly anyone interested in the era covered.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 2023 South American Beach Soccer Evolution League (officially, CONMEBOL Liga Evolución de Fútbol Playa (CONMEBOL Beach Soccer Evolution League)) was the fifth edition of the South American Beach Soccer League, a continental league competition for South American men's national beach soccer teams. It was held from 11 October to 19 November 2023 in its regular season (zones round) with the finals being held on 27 and 28 April 2024.\nOrganised by the governing body for South American football, CONMEBOL, as part of its Development Department's Evolution Program, all ten members of the continental confederation took part, with both senior and under 20s national teams participating in the league events.\nThe teams were first divided into two geographically based zones (North and South) to compete in a round robin tournament against other members of their own zone during the regular season; the points earned by both the senior and under 20s teams are combined. The winners of each zone then proceed to face each other in the finals to contest the title.\nBrazil and Paraguay, who had shared the title the previous season, again contested the finals and this time Paraguay beat the Brazilians to win their second title.\n\n\n== Format ==\n\nThe league operated under the same format established for the inaugural season.\n\n\n== Calendar ==\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\nThe ten member nations of CONMEBOL entered two teams each: their respective senior and under 20s national teams. In total, 20 teams competed.\nFor this season, CONMEBOL maintained the composition of the two zones regarding the previous 2022 edition.\nThe numbers in parentheses show the South American ranking of each team, based on the Beach Soccer Worldwide Rankings (as of 28 August 2023), prior to the start of the season (rankings only apply to the senior teams).\n\nNorth zone\n\nSouth zone\n\n\n== South zone ==\nThe south zone regular season event took place in Luque. Paraguay. All matches were hosted at the Los Pynandi World Cup Stadium, located within the Paraguayan Olympic Park. It was organised in cooperation with the Paraguayan Football Association (APF). Paraguay won the South zone title for the fourth time.\n\n\n=== Standings ===\n\n\n==== Overall ====\n\n\n=== Results ===\nAll match times are local, PYST (UTC−3), as listed by CONMEBOL.\n\n\n== North zone ==\nThe north zone regular season event took place in Salinas. Ecuador. All matches were hosted at Cancha Las Palmeras. It was organised in cooperation with the Ecuadorian Football Federation (FEF). Brazil won their fourth North zone title undefeated and with one matchday to spare.\n\n\n=== Standings ===\n\n\n==== Overall ====\n\n\n=== Results ===\nAll match times are local, ECT (UTC−5), as listed by CONMEBOL.\n\n\n== Finals ==\nThe zone winners faced each other for the league title with their senior teams playing each other over two legs, as do their under 20s representatives for a total of four matches comprising the finals. The winners are the national team which accumulates the most points from all four matches combined.\nThe finals were organised to take place in São Luís (MA), Brazil on 27 and 28 April 2024. All matches were played at the Arena Domingos Leal.\n\n\n=== Matches ===\nAll match times are local, BRT (UTC−3), as listed by CONMEBOL.\n\nBrazil earn three points; Brazil lead the series 3–0.\nThe second match of the finals between the senior teams was initially suspended and then cancelled due to inclement weather (heavy rains).\n\nMatch not played; Brazil continued to lead the series 3–0.\n\nIn order to avoid further cancellations due to weather conditions, the kick-off of the second day's matches was moved forward from 16:00 and 18:00 to 11:00 and 13:00, respectively.\n\nParaguay earn three points; series tied at 3–3.\n\nParaguay earn three points; Paraguay won the series 6–3.\n\n\n=== Winners ===\nAfter the cancellation of the second match on the first day, CONMEBOL decided to take into account only the points accumulated in the three remaining matches to define the champions. Paraguay came from behind in the second day to win the series 6 points to 3 and claimed their second title, thus breaking the streak of 4 consecutive titles won by Brazil.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was the last surviving WWII Flying Tigers pilot.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHo was born in a small town in Ipoh, Perak in 1920 to a shoe shop merchant from China. He was the sixth of six children. He had his primary and secondary education in Malaysia but managed to attend university as his uncle was a rich tin miner.\n\nHe attended St. Stephen's College in Stanley and Lingnan University in Hong Kong in 1941 whilst the Japanese invaded China. He later escaped with his fellow students from China after enduring the Japanese occupation for a few months by bribing bandits to take them across the border.\nHe stated that he had also seen the bombing of Kai Tak Airport. Ho left Hong Kong and went to Guangzhou where he saw a poster for air force recruitment. He then became a trainee pilot for the Chinese-American Composite Wing in 1942 and joined the Flying Tigers, where he trained with other pilots in Arizona.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nAfter his training, Ho was sent on missions as a B-25 Mitchell bomber pilot and performed over 18 missions in occupied China during World War II and returned to Ipoh when he was done. After the war, Ho was stationed in Hankou, Wuhan as an instructor. He later went to Shanghai and became a commercial pilot for Central Air Transport Corporation. This was also where he met his future wife, Augusta Rodrigues, and they got married on 5 May 1949.\nAfter the fall of Shanghai, he and Augusta left and went to Singapore in 1951, where he joined Malayan Airlines and later became a pilot for Singapore Airlines after Malayan Airlines split. He worked at Singapore Airlines for 30 years and retired in 1980 as a chief pilot of Singapore Airlines' Boeing 737 fleet.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHo had been living in Singapore since 1953 till his death in 2024. His wife, Augusta Rodrigues, was Portuguese while his son was born in Guangzhou and his daughter in Hong Kong. They later all got Singaporean citizenship. His wife died in 1977 of lung cancer.\nIn 2019, he released a book titled Memoirs of a Flying Tiger: The Story of a WWII Veteran and SIA Pioneer Pilot from the advice of George Yeo. In 2023, a short film called Flying Tigers based on his life was released and he was portrayed by Richie Koh.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nHo died on 6 January 2024 at the age of 103.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333 (1970), is a conscientious objection case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States.\nElliott Ashton Welsh II, was convicted by a United States District Judge of refusing to submit to induction into the Armed Forces in violation of 50 U.S.C. App. § 462(a), and was, on June 1, 1966, sentenced to imprisonment for three years. One of petitioner's defenses to the prosecution was that § 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act exempted him from combat and noncombat service because he was \"by reason of religious training and belief . . . conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form\". After finding that there was no religious basis for petitioner's conscientious objector claim, the Court of Appeals, Judge Hamley dissenting, affirmed the conviction. 404 F.2d 1078 (1968). \nThe Supreme Court granted certiorari chiefly to review the contention that Welsh's conviction should be set aside on the basis of its decision in United States v. Seeger, 380 U. S. 163 (1965). 396 U.S. 816 (1969). The court declined to pass upon the constitutional arguments that were raised, but voted to reverse this conviction because of its fundamental inconsistency with Seeger.\nPetitioner was convicted of refusing to submit to induction into the Armed Forces despite his claim for conscientious objector status under § 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act. That provision exempts from military service persons who by reason of \"religious training and belief\" are conscientiously opposed to war in any form, that term being defined in the Act as \"belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation\" but not including \"essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal code.\" In his exemption application, petitioner stated that he could not affirm or deny belief in a \"Supreme Being,\" and struck the words \"my religious training and\" from the form. He affirmed that he held deep conscientious scruples against participating in wars where people were killed. The Court of Appeals, while noting that petitioner's \"beliefs are held with the strength of more traditional religious convictions,\" concluded that those beliefs were not sufficiently \"religious\" to meet the terms of § 6(j), and affirmed the conviction. Petitioner contends that the Act violates the First Amendment prohibition of establishment of religion, and that his conviction should be set aside on the basis of United States v. Seeger, 380 U. S. 163, which held that the test of religious belief under § 6(j) is whether it is a sincere and meaningful belief occupying in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualified for the exemption.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed. Pp. 398 U. S. 335-367.\n404 F.2d 1078, reversed.\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, joined by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concluded that:\nThis case is controlled by United States v. Seeger, supra, to which it is factually similar. Under Seeger, § 6(j) is not limited to those whose opposition to war is prompted by orthodox or parochial religious beliefs. A registrant's conscientious objection to all war is \"religious\" within the meaning of § 6(j) if this\nPage 398 U. S. 334\nopposition stems from the registrant's moral, ethical, or religious beliefs about what is right and wrong and these beliefs are held with the strength of traditional religious convictions. In view of the broad scope of the word \"religious,\" a registrant's characterization of his beliefs as \"nonreligious\" is not a reliable guide to those administering the exemption. Pp. 398 U. S. 335-344.\nhttps://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/398/333/",

        "content": "Inclusive Excellence is a strategic framework employed in a variety of organizational settings, including academic institutions, corporate entities, non-profit organizations, and honor societies, to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Originating in the educational sector, this concept emphasizes the integration of diversity into the core missions and operational strategies of organizations, aiming to foster innovation and enhance outcomes by ensuring all community members are actively engaged and supported.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe term \"Inclusive Excellence\" was popularized by entities like the Association of American Colleges & Universities (AAC&U) in the early 21st century. Moving beyond simple numeric diversity, it advocates for a more comprehensive approach that unequivocally connects diversity with excellence. This framework influences not only policies like admissions and hiring but also everyday interactions, including those within academic honor societies, creating environments where a diverse array of individuals can thrive. \n\n\n== Principles of Inclusive Excellence ==\nInclusive excellence revolves around key principles:\nAccess and Success: This involves ensuring equitable access to opportunities for all, including within honor societies, which historically have selective membership criteria that could benefit from more inclusive practices.\nClimate and Intergroup Relations: Fostering a supportive and respectful environment is crucial in settings like honor societies, where diverse member interactions enhance the group's dynamism.\nEducation and Scholarship: Incorporating diverse perspectives into curricula and research, which honor societies can lead in their respective academic fields.\nInstitutional Infrastructure: Developing structures that support diversity and inclusion at every level, including in the governance of honor societies.\n\n\n== Implementation ==\nOrganizations, including honor societies, implement inclusive excellence through:\nPolicy Development: Modifying policies to enhance equity, such as revising honor society membership criteria to be more inclusive.\nProgram and Curriculum Development: Designing programs that reflect and celebrate diversity, which honor societies can adopt to broaden their educational impact.\nOutreach and Engagement: Ensuring a broad range of perspectives are included and valued, a key for honor societies seeking to enrich their membership's experience and representation.\nAssessment and Evaluation: Continually assessing the effectiveness of DEI efforts, crucial for honor societies to remain relevant and impactful in a changing academic landscape.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nThe application of inclusive excellence has proven to positively affect organizational performance and individual satisfaction by creating supportive and innovative environments. For honor societies, embracing these principles helps prepare members for success in a diverse world and ensures that these societies stay relevant and effective.\nInclusive excellence remains a dynamic and evolving approach to diversity and inclusion. As societies grow more diverse, the principles of inclusive excellence are increasingly vital in shaping the future of all institutions, including honor societies, driving them towards a more integrated and strategic effort to harness the benefits of diversity for organizational and educational success.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion\nAmerican Association of Colleges and Universities\nHonor society\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The retirement of a spacecraft refers to the discontinuation of a spacecraft from active service. This can involve deorbiting the spacecraft, discontinuing of the probes operations, passivating it, or loss of contact with it. One notable example of spacecraft retirement is Cassini's retirement in 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first spacecraft to be retired was the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 probe. Sputnik was originally launched in 1957, and eventually completed its mission by naturally deorbiting due to gravitational forces. It spent roughly 3 months orbiting Earth, completing 1,440 orbits in the duration.\nIn 1958, NASA launched the Vanguard 1 probe with the aim of winning in the Space Race. Six years later, NASA officially concluded the mission as the probe had fulfilled all its experimental and objective requirements. NASA made sure the probe would survive for up to 2,000 years. However, due to solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag, the hypothesized reentry date has been reduced to approximately 240 years from now, where Vanguard 1 is expected to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up.\nFollowing the discontinuation of the Vanguard 1 probe, many space agencies and subsequent spacecraft have ceased operations through various methods.\nIn 2017, the Cassini–Huygens probe concluded its 19-year exploration mission by plunging into Saturn's atmosphere. The decision to end the mission was prompted by the minimal power supply from the probe's radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). The maneuver started on November 29, 2016, where Cassini performed a flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, which positioned it into the orbital plane of Saturn's F Ring for its grand finale. Cassini performed another subsequent flyby of Titan on April 22, 2017, during which positioned the probe to pass within a precise 3,100 km (1,900 mi) of Saturn's clouds. The process of flybys was repeated 22 times until September 15, 2017, at 11:55:46 UTC, when communication with Cassini's antenna was lost during the 22nd flyby of Saturn. Cassini's grand finale represented the inaugural intentional entry of a spacecraft into the atmosphere of a gas giant, and marks the first major spacecraft to burn up in the atmosphere of a gas giant (excluding the Galileo Atmospheric Probe). The mission's success has significantly influenced the planning and execution of both present and future missions focused on gas and ice giants.\n\n\n== Reasons ==\n\n\n=== Power decrement ===\n\nMany modern spacecraft utilize radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), and spacecraft electric propulsion as their power source. Over time, the power output of RTGs or SEPs diminishes due to the gradual depletion of the radioactive isotopes they rely on for electricity generation.\nRadioisotope thermoelectric generators convert the heat generated by the decay of radioactive isotopes into electricity, providing a reliable power source for spacecraft equipped with RTGs. As the radioactive isotopes decay over time, the power output of the RTGs gradually decreases. It’s estimated that the power output from the RTGs will fall below the threshold required to operate the spacecraft’s systems effectively, including communication with Earth and scientific instruments. As a result, spacecraft equipped with RTGs will eventually run out of power sufficient enough to power their instruments.\nSpacecraft electric propulsion systems utilize electric fields to accelerate charged ions to high velocities, generating thrust for propulsion. Unlike chemical propulsion systems, which rely on the combustion of propellant, electric propulsion systems ionize propellant using electrical energy and then accelerate the resulting ions to produce thrust. As the ions are expelled from the spacecraft at high speeds, they create thrust in the opposite direction, enabling spacecraft maneuverability. Electric propulsion systems offer high efficiency and long-duration capabilities, making them suitable for precise trajectory adjustments, extended deep space missions, and potential future crewed missions. These systems rely on electrical energy for ionization and acceleration of propellant, typically supplied by onboard power sources such as solar panels or batteries. However, over time, these energy sources may become depleted, particularly in missions with extended durations or in environments with limited sunlight. Additionally, the components of SEP systems, including power electronics and ionization chambers, may degrade due to exposure to harsh space conditions, leading to decreased efficiency and power output. Furthermore, some SEP systems have a limited supply of propellant, such as xenon gas, which can be exhausted over the course of a mission, rendering the system unable to generate thrust. Ultimately, the end of a spacecraft's mission or operational life may also result in the cessation of power generation by the SEP system, marking the conclusion of its propulsion capabilities.\n\n\n=== Loss of contact ===\n\nCommunication loss between spacecraft and Earth is a known occurrence, particularly as spacecraft travel deeper into space. Factors like distance, technical malfunctions, or power source depletion can all contribute to this loss. Efforts may be made to re-establish communication, but success isn’t guaranteed due to technological limitations or the spacecraft’s condition. \nPioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 serve as prominent examples of spacecraft encountering communication failures with Earth. As these probes traveled deeper into space, the distance between them and Earth grew, posing challenges for maintaining contact. Ultimately, their antennas dropped below Earth’s radio detection threshold, leading to the loss of communication.\n\n\n== Methods ==\n\n\n=== Deorbitation ===\n\nWhen spacecraft lose funding or complete their scientific objectives, they may alter their trajectories in various ways. One common approach is to redirect the spacecraft towards a path where it will burn up in the atmosphere of the celestial body they were orbiting. This intentional reentry minimizes the risk of the spacecraft becoming space debris, or helps the contamination of planets or moons.\n\n\n=== Mission completion ===\n\nSome spacecraft are retired upon completing their scientific objectives. Depending on the mission’s requirements and circumstances, various retirement strategies may be employed. For example, spacecraft can be intentionally deorbited, Alternatively, they may be left in orbit around a planet or moon, however, leaving a spacecraft in orbit around a planet or moon carries the risk of contamination or the creation of space debris. Contamination could occur if the spacecraft carries microbes or organic material from Earth, potentially affecting the planetary or lunar environments. Additionally, if the spacecraft were to malfunction or fragment in orbit, it could contribute to the accumulation of space debris, posing hazards to other spacecraft and future missions. Therefore, decisions regarding the fate of retired spacecraft must carefully weigh these risks and implement measures to mitigate them.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSpace debris\nSpacecraft cemetery\nGraveyard orbit\nPlanetary protection\nList of Solar System probes\n\n\n== References ==",

The Register is headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands, and has an office in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nOn 2 April 2024, the Register opened to applications, and within the first 24 hours of opening the office received over 100 online applications, anticipating an eventual 300,000 to 600,000 claims.\nAs of April 2024, the Register of Damage for Ukraine only accepts claims regarding the damage or destruction of residential real estate. Other categories, such as injury or loss, will gradually become available throughout 2024. \nThe Register will not pay out any claims, but is instead the initial approach to an international compensation mechanism that is not yet established. Preceding the creation of the Register, in November 2022, the United Nations \"recognized that Russia must be held to account for its violations of international law in Ukraine, including by way of payment of reparation.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nInternational Criminal Court investigation in Ukraine\nLegality of the Russian invasion of Ukraine\nUkraine v.

The species is known to be found distributed in Brazil, Costa Rica, and Peru, where individuals are found exclussively feeding on Calliandra angustifolia. The species name nodosus means 'full of knots' in Latin. Ants in the genera Pheidole and Crematogaster have been observed attending Peruvian treehoppers for their honeydew secretions, however for H. nodosus, the adults repel any ants attending the immatures by vigorously moving the abdomen.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Boris Perchatkin (Russian: Перчаткин, Борис Георгиевич; born 1 July 1946) — the most famous participant in the Nakhodka's religious emigration movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s, a human rights activist who lobbied in the United States for the adoption of the \"Lautenberg's Amendment\" in 1989, as a result of which about 1 million people emigrated to the United States from the countries of the former USSR.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBoris Perchatkin was born in family of a military pilot who died in a car accident shortly after Boris was born. Some time after the death of her first husband, Boris' mother remarried a military man, who in 1953 was arrested for failure to follow orders during the riots and given 25 years of exile in the Vorkuta's camps. At the age of 16, Boris found a Pentecostal church in the city of Nakhodka, which he joined. Later, he collected information about the persecution of believers and actively shared it with foreign journalists.\nIn 1976, Perchatkin, together with his associates Vasily Patrushev, V. A. Burlachenko and Vladimir Stepanov, established contact with dissidents in Moscow and received recommendations “to direct the wave of emigration into an organized direction”. In the same year, a representative of the Moscow Helsinki Group, L.V. Voronina, arrived in Nakhodka. Beginning this year, Perchatkin actively sought the mass departure of Pentecostals from the USSR. In the same year, Perchatkin sent appeals to the UN, to the World Council of Churches and the heads of state that signed the Helsinki Accords, in which he spoke about the constant persecution of believers in the USSR.\nIn 1977, together with Nikolai Goretoy, he spoke out in defense of the arrested dissidents Alexander Ginzburg, Yuri Orlov and Anatoly Sharansky, appealing to the Christians of the world on behalf of the Pentecostals. In the same year, together with other Christians from different denominations, he took part in a public hunger strike, the purpose of which was to obtain permission for persecuted Christians to leave the USSR.\nOn December 20, 1978, Perchatkin tried to send a congratulatory New Year's telegram to US President Jimmy Carter through the Nakhodka Post Office asking for attention to those who do not have freedom of religion.\nSince 1979, he carried out organizational work to create a Center for Emigration-minded Believers in the USSR, claiming to be its leader. In 1980, he was elected as secretary of the created Council of Soviet Pentecostal Churches who were inclined to emigrate. At the end of 1979, Perchatkin wrote a statement “To the Congress and the government of the United States, the governments of Canada, Australia, England, Germany, France and Italy,” in which he spoke about Soviet reality, the program provisions of the CPSU on religious issues in the USSR and outlined Soviet legislation on religious cults.\nHe was the most active member of the committee of believers who applied to emigrate. The Soviet government organized the persecution of Perchatkin and his family through the publication in the central city newspaper of articles “Hypocrite wholesale and retail”, “Convictions of convenience”, “Before it’s too late”, etc.\nOn August 21, 1980, Perchatkin was arrested in Nakhodka, and at the end of March 1981 he was convicted under Article 190.1 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR for spreading “deliberately false fabrications discrediting the Soviet state and social system” to 2 years in prison. According to the Voice of America radio station, during the investigation and at trial, chemicals were used on Perchatkin, which caused him to lose consciousness.\nIn August 1982, Perchatkin was released and subsequently continued to seek the right to emigrate from the USSR. In February 1983, he was arrested again and then sentenced under Part 2 of Article 218 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR to 1.5 years for illegally carrying cold weapon.\nIn 1987, Perchatkin compiled report for the US Congress \"On the State of Religion in the USSR\". This report was read in the US Congress and Perchatkin was invited to a meeting with US Secretary of State George Shultz to talk about religious migration, as well as with US Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist and the US Under Secretary of State for Religious Affairs. In May 1988, when US President Ronald Reagan came to the USSR on an official visit to meet with Gorbachev, Perchatkin was invited to a meeting with Reagan's wife, Nancy Reagan, as part of a delegation of 40 people to discuss the issue of religious freedom in the USSR. On May 30, 1988, Perchatkin represented Soviet Protestants at this meeting. For about two hours he told Nancy Reagan about the state of affairs with freedom of religion in the USSR, after which Nancy Reagan invited Perchatkin to read a report on the situation of religion in the USSR to the US Congress.\nOn July 26, 1988, Perchatkin emigrated to the USA along with his entire family. On August 4, he spoke at the US Congress with report on the genocide of believers in the USSR, which he subsequently discussed with congressmen, senators and diplomats. The result of these discussions  was the adoption in 1989 of the \"Lautenberg Amendment\", named after Democratic Senator from New Jersey Frank Lautenberg. In the first decade of this amendment, about 350,000 religious migrants entered the United States, and in the period until 2010 - about 1 million. The mass exodus of Pentecostals from Nakhodka began in 1988, when 152 adults left, not counting young children. In 1989, 45 adult Pentecostals emigrated from Nakhodka.\nWhile in the US, Perchatkin created his own website, on which he described the details of his arrest and imprisonment during the struggle for emigration and organized the Christian human rights organization ARRC. He also published an autobiographical book, \"Paths of Fire\", which was reprinted several times.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBoris Perchatkin - \"Paths of Fire\", 2011\n\n\n== Sources ==\nOstrovskaya O.P.

        "content": "Revelation 12:1 and Revelation 12:2 They are the first verses of Chapter 12 of the book of Revelation.\n\n\n== Content ==\nIn the original Greek according to Septuagint this verse is:1 Καὶ σημεῖον μέγα ὤφθη ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ, γυνὴ περιβεβλημένη τὸν ἥλιον, καὶ ἡ σελήνη ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτῆς στέφανος ἀστέρων δώδεκα, 2 καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχουσα ἔκραζεν ὠδίνουσα καὶ βασανιζομένη τεκεῖν. In the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: 2  And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.The New International Version translates the passage as:1 A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 2 She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe King James Version refers to \"a great wonder\"  and the Revised Standard Version refers to \"a great portent\". The Greek word used is σημεῖον, rendered sign in many other passages in the New Testament. Anglican biblical commentator William Boyd Carpenter writes that \"the word sign is preferable to wonder, both in this verse and in Revelation 12:3. It is the same word which is rendered sign in Revelation 15:1. It is a sign which is seen: not a mere wonder, but something which has a meaning; it is not 'a surprise ending with itself', but a signal to arrest attention, and possessing significance; there is 'an idea concealed behind it'.\"\n\n\n== Interpretation ==\nTheologians view the Woman of the apocalyse in Revelation 12:1–3 as a foresight to the Virgin Mary, both the mother of God and the mother of church; taking Revelation 12 as a reference to Mary, Israel, and the Church as a threefold symbolism through the Book of Isaiah and affirms Mary as the mother of Jesus Christ as the prophetic fulfilment described in Revelation 12 (cf. Isaiah 7:14, 26:17, 54:1, 66:7).\n\n\n== Referances ==",
