        "content": "Antonio Aparicio Perales (10 September 1913) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Valencia CF and CD Castellón. He was a member of the Hércules CF wonder team.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAntonio Aparicio was born in Enguera on 10 September 1913, and made his professional debut with Ontinyent CF in 1932, when he was only 19. In just one year he had become the best left-handed winger in the region and the star of the team, drawing the attention of several scouts nationwide. In the summer of 1933 he was tried out by Sevilla FC, but Valencia, criticized by the local press for letting an Andalusian club take one of the pearls of Valencian football, moved quickly and signed him before the Seville team could make you an offer.\nAgainst all odds, Jack Greenwell barely gave him any opportunities, and apart from six friendlies, he only played one official match in the First Division against an ultra-defensive Arenas club de Getxo, in a match that ended goalless and with half the stands yawning despite Aparicio's speed and overflow, with good dribbling and capable of delivering measured crosses into the area. At the end of the season, and seeing that Anton Fibver had similar football tastes to those of his predecessor, he preferred to look for other options and signed with Levante UD, where he offered excellent benefits that allowed him to sign, in 1935, for Hércules FC, which It was in the First Division.\nAntonio settled in the Alicante club, remaining there until 1941, including the period of the Spanish Civil War, except for a brief return to Valencia to participate with the Mestalla team in two matches in the Mediterranean League. With Hércules, he scored 15 goals in 56 games in the top category, contributing to one of the best periods in the club's history. At the end of his stay on the Costa Blanca, he accepted an interesting offer from Valladolid, which, based in the Segunda División, was fighting to compete for promotion promotions. The following year he went to Granada, where he remained for four seasons, three of them in the First Division and one in the second, in 1945. In the summer of 1946 he announced his retirement as a professional footballer at the age of thirty-two, after having defended the Granada shirt on 47 occasions.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Juan Antonio Alonso Santodomingo (1844 – 10 February 1917) was a Spanish businessman in the canning sector, and founder of the Palacio de Oriente canning company. He was the pioneer of the Galician canning industry.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAntonio Alonso was born in Bayona, Galicia, in 1844, as the son of Juan Antonio Alonso Castro and Rosalía Santodomingo. In 1862, the 18-year-old Alonso emigrated to Havana, when the country was under the sovereignty of the Spanish Empire, where he remained working until 1881 as a commercial intermediary between Cuba and the metropolis (Spain). In Cuba, he married Eloísa Giménez-Cuenca (1860–1935), daughter of an important military man from Matanzas. The couple had six children Pedro, Salvador, Rodrigo, Antonio, Mauro, and Guillermina Alonso Giménez-Cuenca, who married Eduardo Martínez Vázquez, with whom she had Eduardo Martínez Alonso, who went on to become a doctor known for his humanitarian work during the Spanish Civil War and Second World War.\nUpon his return to Vigo, Alonso invested in real estate. It is in Vigo where he established contact with the canning industry and in 1886, he began his own initiative, starting with the help of his partner Benito Albela and from 1890 onwards alone. First, he began to export to France, like other Galician canning businessmen, but soon he began to export to new markets such as Montevideo, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, especially the latter because he retains friendships and contacts from his time as an emigrant. He diversified the preserves, integrating vegetables, and also the fishing process, building two vessels for fishing bream, said fish was destined to be sold both fresh and pickled. However, his first product was sardines in oil.\nStarting in the 1890s, it also began its expansion in the complementary tin foil market, and participated as a shareholder in the launch of a Basque company, Basconia, to compete with the Goitia company, a monopolizer of the tin foil market. Already with part of the management of the canning company shared with his children, he lived through the first sardine crisis, in 1909, from which Palacio de Oriente emerged reinforced by his movements to obtain sardines in Huelva.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAlonso died on 10 February 1917, at the age of either 72 or 73. Upon his death, his children continued the family business saga. His first-born son Pedro, suffering from health problems, did not join the business, and his only daughter Guillermina did not receive the inheritance, so the business saga was continued by Rodrigo, Antonio, Mauro, and Salvador, who in 1918 created the Antonio Alonso-Hijos company. 4 5 6 7\nIn 2014, the descendants of Antonio Alonso Santodomingo met at the Náutico to strengthen family ties; it was the first time that Antonio Alonso's successors met to exchange memories.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eugenia Williamson Hume (1865–1899) was a 19th-century American elocutionist, and educator. She was one of the best educated and most accomplished women in St. Louis, Missouri in her day.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEugenia Williamson was born in 1865. She was the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. E. J. Williamson. Her ancestry was characterized as old Anglo-American. She always lived in St. Louis.\nHume's early training was with Mary Hogan Ludlum. She also studied for an extended period with Emma Dunning Banks. In 1889, Hume graduated from the National School of Elocution and Oratory.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHume was prominent in elocutionary work in St. Louis. She and her sister, Mazy Williamson, also gave elocutionary entertainments in various parts of the West. In 1897, the sisters gave entertainments together in Missouri, Eugenia doing the poses and Mazy giving the recitations, some of the most successful of which were by Banks.\nHaving shown talent in that field early on, she began teaching at the age of 18, and was known as a teacher for many years before graduation from elocutionary school. \nHume was charter member of the St. Louis Branch of the Association of Elocutionists, as well as a member of various other societies and institutions. She was also actively engaged in religious and benevolent work.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nOn April 18, 1899, she married Dr. John R. Hume, a leading physician of St. Louis and professor of physiology at Barnes Medical College.\nEugenia Williamson Hume died at St. Louis, October 13, 1899, at the age of 34, from a valvular lesion of the heart, after an illness of five hours. Her burial was in Bellefontaine Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The West Norfolk Hoard is the largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon coins in England, comprising 132 gold coins and four gold objects dating to around 610 AD, all found over a period of 29 years in West Norfolk. Its origin is notably close in date to the Sutton Hoo burial, with some coins having been struck using the same dies as coins found in a purse at that site.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThe large majority of the coins are Merovingian tremisses. Of those that can be traced, 3 are from Provincia, 5 from Frisia, 17 from Burgundia, 27 from Neustria, 29 from Austrasia, and 30 from Aquitania. The hoard also includes ten coins from the Byzantine Empire; nine solidi and one tremissis. One coin in the horde was previously known only from an engraving in a book by a French writer which was published in 1666, and confirmed the coin's authenticity. Very few of the tremisses fall below 80% gold purity, with one exception being a plated forgery which is broken. Three of the coins are fitted with a suspension loop, making them into jewellery.\nAll the coins were likely minted on Continental Europe as the British Isles did not mint gold coins of its own; at least two of these coins were minted using the same dies as a number of coins from the Sutton Hoo purse hoard, itself dated to 625 AD. Multiple groups of coins within the West Norfolk Hoard were struck by the same dies as each other, and likely travelled together in parcels before joining the hoard; these groups and pairs originate from Maastricht, Javols, Les Cannacs, Mainz, Rouen, Strasbourg, Thiverzay and Windisch. While few can be dated, those which are dateable feature Byzantine emperors Justinian I (527–65), Justin II (565–78), Tiberius II Constantine (578–82) and Maurice Tiberius (582–602) as well as Frankish kings Theudebertus II (595–612) and Theudericus II (595–613).\nFour other gold objects complete the hoard, which consist of a bracteate, a small bar with 44% gold and 48-50% silver content, and two probable jewellery fragments.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe hoard was likely built up by a person who was moving around the Merovingian kingdom. The presence of gold items in the hoard other than coins suggests that their owner used them as bullion rather than as currency.\nThe hoard was placed in about 610 AD, likely buried in a barrow due to its proximity to an Anglo-Saxon cemetery before being scattered by later ploughing.\n\n\n== Finds ==\nThe discovery of all the coins in the hoard spans 29 years, from 1991 to 2020. The finds were deemed as being part of the same hoard on 3 November 2021, totalling to 131 coins and four gold objects.\n\n\n=== 1991 anonymous finds ===\nThe first coin from the horde, a tremissis, was discovered in 1991, and initially thought to be a stray find. An anonymous metal detectorist discovered 35 Merovingian coins at the site and declared them.\n\n\n=== 2012–2015 David Cockle finds ===\nBetween April 2012 and December 2015, David Cockle, a 50-year-old police officer based at Downham Market police station, found 10 of the Merovingian Tremissis coins at the site, valued at about £4,000 each, and sold them to a dealer in three batches over 14 months for a total of £15,000, keeping the money. He had previously agreed to a 50:50 split of the proceeds with the farmer who owned the land for permission to be on the land, but he did not declare the finds to the farmer nor the Norfolk coroner who would have determined if the coins were treasure. Cockle had 30 years of experience as a metal detectorist.\nThe Norfolk and Suffolk Anti-Corruption Unit began an investigation after a member of the public reported him; he was arrested in November 2015, and charged with theft and three charges of handling criminal property in May 2016, after pictures of the stolen coins were found on his mobile phone which matched with coins stocked by a local coin dealer, who had already sold some of the coins. Cockle was suspended from Norfolk Constabulary the same month. He initially denied all charges, but later admitted to stealing the coins at Ipswich Crown Court in January 2017 on the first day of his trial. He was dismissed as a policeman by Norfolk Chief Constable Simon Bailey the next month following a misconduct hearing, who declared the incident as \"one of the grossest breaches of trust\". Cockle did not attend the hearing, though apologised in a written statement.\nCockle was jailed for 16 months and banned from metal detecting, owning metal detecting equipment, and entering into metal detecting agreements with landowners, for five years in March 2017. Judge Rupert Overbury stating that Cockle's motivation was \"pure greed\" and that he knew the legal process associated with such finds. In September, he was ordered to repay the £15,000 or face a further 9 months in prison.\n\n\n=== 2014–2020 anonymous finds ===\nThe majority of the coins were found in a single field by an anonymous individual between 2014 and 2020.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Levi Salem Musa Marhabi is a Yemenite Orthodox Jew and the last known Jew living in Yemen. He was imprisoned by Iran-backed Houthi militants in 2016 for allegedly assisting in smuggling a Torah scroll out of the country. Held in a prison in Sanaa, Marhabi has received harsh treatment from his detainers, with an emergence of reports of torture and deteriorating health conditions. In 2019, a Yemeni court ordered his release, however the Houthis continued to detain him.\n\n\n== Arrest ==\n\nIn March 2016, 17 Yemeni Jews from Raydah were flown from Yemen to Israel on a trip that had been planned for over two years. The operation involved the Jewish Agency for Israel and the United States Department of State. Among those who aided in the operation was Israeli-American businessman Mordechai Kahana. With them, the emigrants took a deerskin Torah scroll which is allegedly over 800 years old. The scroll was seen as a national treasure by both the Houthis and Yemeni authorities. Upon arrival, both the emigrants and the scroll were welcomed by Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu. Photos of the scroll in Israel were seen by the Houthis, who said that it was illegally removed.\nMarhabi, who had lived in Israel, was accused of assisting the emigrants. In the same month, he left back to Yemen due to his difficulties in assimilating in Israel, where he was immediately arrested by Houthi intelligence services. Additionally, three Muslim men were arrested alongside him, including an airport employee who was accused of permitting the emigrants to board an airplane with the scroll.\n\n\n== Imprisonment ==\nSince his arrest, the Houthis have held Marhabi in a prison in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. Throughout his imprisonment, he has faced inhumane conditions, deteriorating health conditions, and torture. Marhabi suffers from issues in his kidneys and lungs, and has lost all of his teeth, allegedly from repeated torture. Reports also suggest that he had become partially paralyzed from a stroke.\nOn 18 March 2018, the Houthis sentenced Marhabi to three years and six months in prison. The following year in September, a Houthi-controlled appeals court ordered Marhabi's release, ruling that he was innocent and being wrongfully detained. The Houthis released the three men who were arrested along with Marhabi, but despite the court ruling, did not release him.\n\n\n=== Houthi ultimatum ===\nIn March 2021, thirteen Jews from three different families, including Marhabi's mother, made a departure from Sanaa to Cairo, Egypt. They initially refused to leave, but agreed when the Houthis demanded departure in exchange for Marhabi's release. One of the Jews stated: \"They gave us a choice between staying in the midst of harassment and keeping Salem a prisoner or leaving and having him released.\" Despite the deal, the Houthis continued to hold Marhabi. The Jews who departed were some of the last of their community living in Yemen. After they left, only four elderly Jews remained in the country. In 2022, a United Nations report said that only one Jew remained in Yemen. Jason Guberman, executive director of the American Sephardi Federation, said that Marhabi was \"undoubtedly\" that Jew.\n\n\n== Calls for release ==\nU.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism Elan Carr called for the immediate release of Marhabi on X (formerly Twitter) in August 2020, saying that he had endured four years in prison despite legal orders to release him. In November of the same year, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for Marhabi's immediate and unconditional release, saying that he had been wrongfully detained and that he stood with Yemen's Jewish population in calling for his release. In 2021, U.S. Department of State spokesperson Ned Price on behalf of the Biden Administration called for Marhabi's release. In the same year, during a United Nations Security Council briefing about Yemen, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield described Marbabi's detention as wrongful and a violation of basic human rights over his religious beliefs. She called on the Houthis to immediately release him and cease their human rights abuses.\n\nThe American Sephardi Federation (ASF), in collaboration with the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, launched a campaign to raise public awareness about Marhabi's conditions, however it was met with little traction. Jason Guberman said that Marhabi's release should be demanded by not only the U.S. government but Jewish organizations across the world, and called it unfortunate how his case did not receive much attention from the Jewish community.\nSenior rabbi in the United Arab Emirates Elie Abadie also called for Marhabi's immediate release. He mentioned how three other Muslim men were arrested with him, yet he was the only one who remained imprisoned, which Abadie said was because of his religion. He called the Houthis' treatment of Marhabi and the rest of the Yemeni Jews \"crimes against humanity\" and called on them to respect religious freedom.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLibi Marhabi's profile on the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom\nMike Pompeo's statement condemning Marhabi's detention",

        "content": "Gilberto Gerald (born November 27, 1950), more commonly known as Gil, is an Afro-Panamanian activist, essayist and architect. He is known for HIV/AIDS activism, and LGBT rights in the United States.\n\n\n== Life ==\nGerald was born on 27 November 1950, in Panama City, Panama. He was raised there before moving to Ghana, Trinidad and Tobago, and then finally to the United States at 17 years old, where he completed high school. He came out as gay while studying architecture at the Pratt Institute in New York City, where he was the president of a fraternity.\nGerald was born into a family of three brothers. His father is Alfred Nelson Gerald, the former Inspector General of Health of the Republic of Panama and former PAHO official, and his mother is Dorothy Whiteman Gerald. Roque Gerald, the former director of the Washington, D.C. Child and Family Services Agency, is one of his younger brothers. His older brother, Alpha Gerald, passed away in August 1985. His family spoke spoke both Spanish and English while he was growing up.\nAfter a process of four years, Gerald became a naturalized United States citizen in 1980.\nGerald retired in 2016 and lives in Palm Springs, California with his husband, Jeff. He is currently writing a memoir on his life and activism.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nAfter graduating from the Pratt Institute with a bachelor's degree in architecture, Gerald moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as an architect. He became involved with local activist organizations after being inspired by a chance encounter with ABilly S. Jones-Hennin.\nGerald was a co-founder of the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays (NCBLG) in 1978 (initially named the National Coalition of Black Gays), alongside other activists including ABilly S. Jones-Hennin, Darlene Garner, Delores P. Berry, Louis Hughes, Rev. Renee McCoy, and John Gee. The goal of the organization was to support the interests of Black gays and lesbians, since many LGBT organizations were discrimatory towards them.\nIn 1979, Gerald and the NCBLG organized the National Third World Lesbians and Gays Conference during the first March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights.\nIn 1983, Gerald was elected as the executive director of NCBLG. He organized a sit-in protest at the office of D.C. delegate Walter Fauntroy when the organizers of the 20th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington were resistant to including LGBT organizations. This protest, and the arrests of activists Ray Melrose, Melvin Boozer, Phil Pannell, and Gary Walker, attracted the attention of civil rights figures like Coretta Scott King, Joseph Lowery, and Benjamin Hooks. Along with activist Virginia Apuzzo, Gerald helped ensure that Audre Lorde spoke at the march. Afterwards, King publicly endorsed the addition of gays and lesbians to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\nIn 1986, the NCBLG held the National Conference on AIDS in the Black Community at the D.C. convention center, resulting in the creation of the National Minority AIDS Council in 1987, which Gerald founded alongside activists including Carl Bean and Craig G. Harris. \nDuring the National Conference on AIDS in the Black Community, Gerald (with activists like Suki Ports and Carl Bean) spoke for two and a half hours with C. Everett Koop, the U.S. Surgeon General, who had not previously been aware of the disproportionate impact of AIDS on communities of color. This conversation resulted in additions to Koop's report, \"Understanding AIDS,\" which was mailed to every home in the nation in 1988.\nThis same year, Gerald left the NCBLG, which disbanded a few years later. On the disbanding, Gerald said that he believed that the organization just hadn't been designed to address the issues of HIV/AIDS. The National Minority AIDS Council is still in operation.\nGerald was the director of minority affairs for the National AIDS Network in Washington, DC, focusing on the needs of Black and gay people living with HIV/AIDS. During this time, he spoke as an educator on AIDS in the gay community on multiple occasions.\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, California in 1989, Gerald became the executive director of the National Minority AIDS Council when Carl Bean stepped down. \nGerald would continue to be a prominent organizer within HIV/AIDS and LGBT organizations in California, including the AIDS Project Los Angeles, Gentlemen Concerned, and the Black Coalition on AIDS.\nHe founded the LGBT consulting firm Gil Gerald & Associates, Inc. in 1991, which assisted non-profits and government agencies with LGBT topics until Gerald's retirement in 2016.\n\n\n== Writing and appearances ==\nGerald's work, \"The Trouble I've Seen\" (1987), is included in Freedom in This Village: Twenty-Five Years of Black Gay Men's Writing, 1979 to the Present, a 2005 anthology of black gay male literature by E. Lynn Harris. His writing and essays have appeared in other anthologies and magazines, including several connected to activist and writer Joseph Beam, as well as the NCBLG's magazine Black/Out.\nOne of his presentations that Gerald made during his time with the National AIDS Network in Washington, DC, made at a seminar at the SUNY Health and Science Center at Brooklyn, was adapted into an article and published in the Journal of the National Medical Association in April 1989.\nIn January 2024, Gerald appeared on an episode of WNYC Studios' Blindspot podcast titled Mourning in America alongside people like Valerie Reyes-Jimenez, Phill Wilson, and Dr. Anthony Fauci to discuss the history of the HIV/AIDS crisis.\n\n\n== Works (selected) ==\n\"With My Head Held Up High\"  (In the life: a Black gay anthology, Joseph Beam, Alyson Publications, 1986, page 35)\n\"Hey, Joe.

        "content": "Eileen Costello O’Shaughnessy was a 47-year-old Irish woman who was murdered on 30 November 1997 while working as a taxi driver in Galway city. Her murder remains unsolved.\n\n\n== Background ==\nEileen was originally from Corofin, County Galway. She was a mother of two adult children and was separated from her husband, a Garda. Following her separation, she moved in with her mother. She worked as a taxi driver in Galway and had previously worked as a hairdresser.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn 30 November 1997, Eileen began work at 8am. At 8pm Eileen contacted her taxi base and said she was taking a fare to Claregalway. About 20 minutes later the base attempted to contact Eileen about a fare but got no reply. Eileen was due to meet the taxi owner at 9pm on Dyke Road, Galway, to hand over the taxi and keys so that he could take over the night shift but she did not show up. He made unsuccessful attempts to contact her.\nAfter Eileen could not be contacted, a number of taxi drivers in Galway began searching for her and her taxi, a silver Toyota Carina license plate number 97-G-6663. The taxi was soon discovered at Lydon House Bakery on the Tuam Road in Galway. Hair and blood were found within the vehicle and there had been an attempt to rip out the taxi meter. The taxi meter read 17 miles, the exact distance from Galway city center to the body dump site and back to were the car was dumped.\nA search for Eileen began and her body was discovered shortly before midday following day, 1 December 1997, on Tinkers Lane, Knockdoemore. She had been badly beaten. The post-mortem found that she had died from head injuries and had not been sexually assaulted.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nGardaí immediately suspected robbery was the motive for the killing as her taxi earnings, believed to be around £70, were gone.\nFollowing the murder, Eileen's mother Nora reported that the household had received a number of calls in the run up to the murder where the caller said nothing for a number of minutes before hanging up.\nGardaí investigated a potential link between Eileen's killing and an attempted abduction of a female driver that occurred shortly before the murder and close to where her car was found.\nFollowing Eileen's murder, taxi drivers and businessmen in the area raised a £30,000 reward for information that led to the conviction of her killer. An anonymous donor later increased the reward to £80,000.\nGardaí travelled to England to interview a convicted killer who had been in Galway at the time of the murder.\nIn 2001 Gardaí arressted double murderer Thomas Murray for questioning about Eileen's murder. Murray was convictied of the 1981 killing his neighbour William Mannion, which he committed when he was just 17. While out on parole in 2000, Murray killed Nancy Nolan. Murray was on temporary release and living and working in Galway at the time of Eileen's murder. It emerged that Gardaí suspected Murray of Eileen's murder early into the investigation but he had an alibi, however it was later discovered that he had no alibi for the time of the murder.\nOn the 25th anniversary of Eileen's murder, Gardaí issued a renewed appeal for the public's assistance in solving the crime. They highlighted a number of leads they were investigation and requested help identifying a number of potential witnesses. One concerned a sighting of a blonde female walkning on the hard shoulder of the N17 near the body dump site. The woman was walking against traffic and appeared distressed.\nA further sighting took place at 8:45pm on the night of the murder on the N17. A driver saw Eileen's taxi being driven erratically by a bearded man who turned left at Lydon House Bakery, the location where the taxi was found. A man was also seen jumping off a wall at Lydon House Bakery at 9pm on the night of the murder. The man was described as wearing a green jacket and carrying a small canvas bag.\nAt 2am on the morning after the murder, a red car with its parking lights on was seen in Tinkers Lane, the location where Eileen's body was found.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nA memorial stone for Eileen was unveiled in Eyre Square for the 10th anniversary of her murder. A plaque was also placed at the location where her body was found.\n\n\n== Media ==\nEileen's murder was featured in RTÉ's Crimeline program which led to a number of tips. The murder was also featured in the television documentary Solved and Unsolved. Her murder was also featured in an episode of Crimecall.\nHer murder was also covered in the true crime book The Cold Case Files: On the Trail of Ireland's Undetected Killers by Barry Cummins.\nTo mark the 15th anniversary of Eileen's murder, taxi drivers around Galway placed \"Justice\" stickers to highlight the lack of resolution in the case. A website, justiceforeileen.com, was also set up.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cowling Hall is a historic building in Cowling, a village near Bedale in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe oldest part of the building was probably constructed as a peel tower in the 12th century.  It was extended around 1450 to form a manor house, with the old section as one of two wings.  The old wing was altered in the 17th century.  The great hall and one of the wings were demolished in 1700, and replaced by a rectangular house in the Queen Anne style.  At the time, the house was owned by Henry Raper.\nDuring World War II, the property was used to house Canadian air personnel based at RAF Leeming.  After the war, it had a variety of private owners, most notably Greysham Macy, who cut a large peace symbol in the lawn as a protest against the noise caused by Royal Air Force aircraft.  At some point, it was divided into two properties.  The entire building was grade I listed in 1966.\nThe main block is built of rendered brick on a plinth, with stone dressings, quoins, and a pantile roof with stone coping to the left and shaped kneelers.  There are two storeys and five bays, and a bay to the left under the same roof with three storeys.  The middle bay projects and contains a doorway with a rusticated Doric surround, pilasters on plinths, a frieze with triglyphs, and a cornice.  Above it is a window with consoles, a frieze, and a triangular pediment.  The doorway and windows are flanked by narrow sash windows with double keystones, and the outer bays contain wider sash windows with double keystones.  The projecting wing to the left is built of stone and has a stone slate roof with stone coping.  There are two storeys and six bays.  The doorway has moulded jambs and a pointed arch, and above it is an arched cusped window with a transom.  The other windows are sashes, some with quoined surrounds, and to the left is a sundial.

Hitro talk 06:18, 13 May 2024 (UTC)\n\nSociety for the Study of Midwestern Literature\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Society for the Study of Midwestern Literature (SSML) is a non-profit academic organization dedicated to the exploration and promotion of literature, art, film, and cultural studies focused on the American Midwest. Founded in 1971, the SSML fosters interdisciplinary scholarship, supports critical inquiry, and celebrates diverse representations of the Midwestern experience.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe SSML emerged from growing scholarly interest in regional American literature during the mid-20th century. A group of Midwestern literature scholars, led by Professor David D. Anderson of Michigan State University, convened the first formal meeting of the society in 1971. The organization's early focus centered on identifying core traits of Midwestern literature and establishing a critical framework for its analysis. Over time, the SSML's scope expanded to encompass a wider spectrum of artistic and cultural expressions relevant to the Midwest.\n\n\n== Activities and Programs ==\nAnnual Conference: The cornerstone of the SSML's activities is its annual conference. Each year, members gather for a multi-day event featuring keynote speakers, scholarly paper presentations, roundtable discussions, creative readings, and special exhibits. Conference themes often examine specific aspects of the Midwestern experience or the work of significant Midwestern authors. Notable past speakers have included Vietnam author Tim O'Brien, former US Poet Laureate Ted Kooser and  Sandra Cisneros, author of New York Times best seller The House on Mango Street.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThe SSML publishes two primary periodicals:\nMidAmerica: An annual, peer-reviewed journal featuring scholarly articles, essays, interviews, and book reviews on all aspects of Midwestern literature and culture.\nSSML Newsletter: A member-focused publication providing news, conference updates, calls for papers, and features on Midwestern authors and cultural figures.\nMidwestern Miscellany: Published twice a year by the Society for the Study of Midwestern Literature, a guest editor selects a theme, topic, or author and issues a call for the issue. Often those whose essays are selected for the special issue present them on panels organized by the guest editor at the annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Midwestern Literature, or at the Society’s panels at MMLA, MLA, PCA, and/or ALA.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nMark Twain Award: The Mark Twain Award honors a lifetime of creative work focused on the Midwest. Notable past recipients of the award former US Poet Laureate Ted Kooser in 1995, Gwendolyn Brooks in 1986, librettist and playwright Sandra Seaton in 2012 and Ray Bradbury in 1991.\nThe David D. Anderson Award for Outstanding Essay in Midwestern Literary Studies: Winners include Meg Gillette in 2021 and 2023 winner Crystal S. Rudds.\nMidwestern Studies Book Award Awarded to a selected writer of a single-author book-length work that addresses the various aspects of cultural and literary history or conditions from or about the Midwestern states.\nMidAmerica Award: Bestowed annually for distinguished contributions to the study of Midwestern literature. Some prestigious winners of the MidAmerica Award, given by the Society for the Study of Midwestern Literature for distinguished contributions to the study of Midwestern literature, include Jon K. Lauck in 2023, recognized for his role as editor-in-chief of the Middle West Review and founding president of the Midwestern History Association. Another notable recipient is Dr. Steve Trout in 2017, who is a professor and chair of English, honored for his career-long contributions to Midwestern literary studies​​.\n\n\n== Membership ==\nSSML membership is open to scholars, teachers, students, writers, artists, and anyone with an interest in the Midwestern region's literature, culture, and history. Members receive subscription to SSML publications, discounted conference registration, and opportunities to participate in the society's governance.",

        "content": "The Law against Fascism, Neofascism and Similar Expressions (Spanish: Ley contra el Fascismo, Neofascismo y Expresiones Similares), also known as the Law against fascism or the Anti-fascism law, is a 2024 Venezuelan bill intended to \"establish the means and mechanisms to preserve peaceful coexistence and public tranquility\" and \"protect Venezuelan society from the emergence of any expression of a fascist, neo-fascist or similar nature\". On 2 April, Delcy Rodríguez presented it to the V National Assembly of Venezuela, controlled by the administration of Nicolás Maduro; it passed its first reading on the same day, in record time. The law, which would need a second hearing, would ban certain organizations, messages on social media, and create penalties including increased sentences for organizations that promote what Maduro's government defines as fascism.\nMaduro's government says the law is needed to address what it calls unconstitutional violence encouraged by some sectors of society in the last two decades. Rodríguez referred to the 2014 and 2017 Venezuelan protests, stating that \"extremist sectors\" (referring to the parties who make up the majority opposition) had caused \"economic and social genocide\" in the country. Critics and non-governmental organizations say the law would be used to limit opposition to Maduro's government ahead of the July 2024 Venezuelan presidential election; an article in Spain's El País stated that the law \"opens a new door for the control at the discretion of the Government of political freedoms and expression in Venezuela, amid a tightening of the persecution against opponents, journalists and critics\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA director for Human Rights Watch tweeted that the law would \"allow opponents to be criminalized and candidates to be disqualified\". Amnesty International criticized the proposed law for its vague and ambiguous definition of fascism, its limits on freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly, and criminalization of opposition to Maduro.\nVenezuela's National College of Journalists stated that the law \"constitutes a serious risk for the essential rights of Venezuelan society, which are guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution and the international pacts signed by the Venezuelan State\", specifically, \"freedom of expression, thought, association, teaching and dissent\".\nSenators Marco Rubio (R-FL), Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Ben Cardin (D-MD) serving on the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations issued a statement expressing concern that the upcoming presidential elections would not be \"free, fair, nor democratic\", nothing the passage of the bill as \"further proof that civil society, political opposition, and freedom of the press have no place in Venezuela\".\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center expressed concern that, if enacted, the law could have antisemitic applications.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Eliza Crosby Allen (1803–1848) was a 19th-century American journal editor. For more than eight years, she served as the editor of the Mothers' Journal. \n\n\n== Early life ==\nEliza Crosby was born at Winchendon, Massachusetts, August 20, 1803. At the age of three or four, she removed with her parents to Montpelier, Vermont. Her mother survived her at an advanced age, residing in Louisville, Kentucky; and two of her mother's brothers, the Hon. Joseph Locke and John Locke, Esq., were residents of Lowell, Massachusetts. Her father died at Montpelier when she was about 18 years of age. Her parents were Christians; and her mother, sought religiously to train her six children\nAt the age of fourteen, Eliza united with the Congregational Church in Montpelier. Six years after, her views changed. There being no Baptist Church at her home, she retained her membership with the Congregationalists until her removal to West Boylston, Massachusetts, when she became one of the Baptist Church in that place.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOn November 21, 1827, she married Rev. Ira M. Allen, then of Brandon, Vermont, but who became, in 1830, the agent of the Baptist General Tract Society, and removed in the discharge of his official duties to Philadelphia. Here she was united with the Sansom Street Church, then under the pastoral charge of the Rev. John L. Dagg.\nHer labors in this new sphere, in connection with various women's societies, in the conduct of a young women's Bible Class, in preparing and editing tracts, and in relieving her husband by assuming the charge of the depository and correspondence during his frequent absences, were complex and onerous. At the same time, she took care of her home and received her husband's guests and friends. In addition to all of these responsibilities, she found time to become a contributor to several religious periodicals.\nThe Mother's Journal was first published in Utica, New York, by Bennet and Bright. It was a monthly publication of sixteen pages,designed to instill valuable social and moral lessons for parents and children. Allen was the third editor, taking over in 1840. Having fewer personal responsibilities than the previous editors, Allen was able to give more time to the preparation of articles for its pages, and in correspondence with friends, to interest them in its behalf. At the same time, her husband's employment was transferred to the American and Foreign Bible Society, and his residence to New York City. During the time Allen conducted it, her husband, Rev. Allen, assumed its proprietorship; it was enlarged to 32 pages, and published in New York City.\nAllen never enjoyed perfect health. Before her marriage, sickness brought her close to death. After that event, at Brandon, and for a time in Philadelphia also, she was the subject of a spinal affection which caused great suffering, and disabled her from walking. Relieved from this, her constitution continued to be feeble. Still, she remained active in the order of her household, in her interest in various societies, and in her literary employments.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nHer husband, then in the employ of the American and Foreign Bible Society, being required to leave home on a tour for the collection of funds, was for three months during the winter of 1847–1848 absent from her. The responsibility of procuring the paper for the Journal and making contracts with its printer, and conducting the correspondence, as well as supplying the editorial matter, was not only in itself severe, but it occasioned inevitable exposure to the severity of the weather, which broke down her strength. When the influenza seemed to leave behind it the incipient symptoms of tuberculosis, she hoped to recover as she had in former years from a similar affection.\nKindly invited by the Rev. John Teasdale in June 1848 to try the restorative effects of a residence at his house at Schooley's Mountain, New Jersey, she found the air and the weather, cold and stormy. Upon returning home, exceedingly ill, her lungs were examined and the case was pronounced one of decided pulmonary disease. She gave instructions to her husband on the disposition to be made of her books and effects after her death, and also of her interment. Though her brother invited Allen to winter in Florida, she died on October 15, 1848.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nELIZA C.

On 10 and 11 April 1995, UNPROFOR called in air strikes to protect the Goražde safe area, resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US F-16 jets. This was the first time in NATO's history it had attacked ground targets with aircraft. Subsequently, Bosnian Serbs entered into the Gorazde safe zone to the UN peace keepers. Serbian Army soldiers took 150 UN personnel hostage on 14 April 1995. A British Sea Harrier was sent to scout the situation and potentially attack Serbian positions, but Serbs were prepared. On 16 April 1995, a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Bosnian Serb forces.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sarah Ortegon HighWalking is a visual artist, dancer and actor. She is an enrolled member of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes. Her work has been presented at the 60th Venice Biennale and at the Denver Art Museum. She is the first woman artist to represent the state of Wyoming at the Venice Biennale.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nOrtegon Highwalking was born in Denver, one of 12 children. She spent summers as a child on the Wind River Reservation.\nShe received a BA degree from Metropolitan State University of Denver. After graduating from university, she attended the National Outdoor Leadership School which enabled her to travel to Alaska. There she hiked, for several months off-trail in the Chugack Mountains and also sea kayaked. She later became an expedition leader for the school.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe primarily creates beadwork on animal skin, and also produces acrylic paintings. Her work has been exhibited at the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Venice Biennale and the Denver Art Museum, among other venues. According to the Denver Art Museum, her work \"embraces the resilience of Indigenous people and acknowledges the ways in which they exist in the modern world.\"\nOrtegon HighWalking performs in a jingle dress, an experience she says \"feels like there’s an inner spirit that is dancing with the regalia\". Her contribution to the exhibition at the National Museum of Women in the Arts includes paintings of jingle dresses and a beaded cradleboard. The jingle dress traditions originated with the Anishinaabe people; she learned this type of dancing from other dancers at powows since she was a child. She has also performed the jingle dance at Lincoln Center in New York City, and most recently at the Venice Bienalle.\nAs an actor she had roles in the television series 1883 and Jamestown, and has performed in the play Black Elk Speaks.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nIn 2013, Ortegon HighWalking was named Miss Native American USA. Following this, she began a career in acting. This provided the opportunity for her to engage in a cultural exchange with Guatamal and Moldova, where she performed.\nIn 2024, the National Museum of Women in the Arts announced her as a \"Wyoming Woman Artist to Watch\" and she was selected as a \"Global Woman to Watch.\"\n\n\n== Collections ==\nOrtegon HighWalking's beadwork on animal skin piece, Home Is Where the Heart Is, is held in the permanent colletion of the Denver Art Museum.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Evmenios Saridakis (Greek: Ευμένιος Σαριδάκης), Evmenios the New or Evmenios the Leper was a Greek Orthodox elder in Athens who lived from 1 January 1931 to 23 May 1999. He was canonized as a saint in the Orthodox Church on 14 April 2022.\n\n\n== Life ==\nElder Evmenios Saridakis was born Constantine Saridakis on 1 January 1931 in Ethia in the province of Monofatsi in Heraklion, Crete to George and Sofia Saridakis. Because he was the eighth and last child, and because of the Nazi occupation of Crete, Constantine did not receive an education. In 1951, he entered the monastery of the Great Martyr Niketas near his village and in three years was tonsured a monk at the age of seventeen with the name Sophronios.\nIn 1954, the monk Sophronios was drafted into the Greek military. After some time, he was diagnosed with leprosy and transferred to Thessaloniki and then to the suburbs of Athens to the St. Barbara Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Athens. Fr. Sophronios recovered fully but decided to remain at the hospital to tend to the other lepers. He remained there for the rest of his life, eventually becoming the spiritual father of the lepers.\nSaint Nikephoros the Leper was transferred to the Athens hospital in 1957 and became the spiritual father of Fr. Sophronios until his repose in 1964. In 1975 at the age of forty-four Fr. Sophronios was ordained a priest with the name Evmenios. In 1992, Fr. Evmenios was awarded the rank of archimandrite and on 23 May 1999 he reposed. He was buried in the village where he was born.\n\n\n=== Attestation of Saint Porphyrios ===\nSaint Porphyrios of Kafsokalyvia, who sometimes went to Fr. Evmenios for confession, called him a “hidden saint of our days\" and said that \"he prays to God that he not be revealed to others but only at the end of his life will it be revealed.\" Furthermore, St. Porphyrios said, \"Go and receive the blessing of Elder Evmenios, because he is the hidden Saint of our days. You can find someone like Elder Evmenios only every two hundred years.\"\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Synaxarion entry for St. Evmenios on May 23.\nSaint Evmenios Saridakis resource page.\n\n\n== Citations ==",

He later began working on new music and eventually \"turned into Porque Puedo\", which he released with little announcement to coincide with the beginning of the Sol María tour. \"Heavyweight\" was also released as its lead single in the same day.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Ricobayo Dam (in Spanish: presa de Ricobayo or salto de Ricobayo) is a hydroelectric engineering work built on the lower course of the Esla river. It is located less than 1 km from Ricobayo de Alba, in the province of Zamora, Castilla y León, Spain.\nThe section in which it is located is known as the arribes of Esla, a deep geographic depression caused by the millenary erosion of the river.\nIt is part of the Saltos del Duero system together with the infrastructures installed in Aldeadávila, Almendra, Castro, Saucelle and Villalcampo.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first project dates from 1919, although the projected height and capacity of the reservoir were lower. Soon the engineers of the Sociedad Hispano Portuguesa de Transportes Eléctricos realized that the flows of the Esla river were capable of creating the largest reservoir in Europe at that time (1200 hm³) with a large regulating capacity that would allow winter water to be stored. This is why in the Agreement of August 11, 1927, signed between Spain and Portugal to regulate the hydroelectric exploitation of the international section of the Douro River, Article 11 stipulates: \"The works to be carried out in Spanish territory, directly aimed at the regulation of the Douro in its international section, referred to in Article 10 of the Royal Decree-Law of August 23, 1926, will begin with the construction, on the Esla River, of the dam called Ricobayo, province of Zamora\".\nWork began in May 1929. The new Ricobayo Dam will regulate the flow of the Esla River and supply electricity to the north of Spain. It was put into operation in January 1934 with an installed power of 100 MW, which in 1947 will be increased to 133 MW. Notwithstanding the above, the official date of the start of operation is February 4, 1935, which is the date recorded by the Government in official documents.\nDuring the construction of the dam, the village of Salto del Esla was built to house the workers who participated in its construction. Some of these houses are still inhabited.\nIts construction led to the stone by stone transfer of the Visigothic temple of San Pedro de la Nave to the town of El Campillo.\nIt was granted a concession period of 75 years from 1935 when it began to operate, so that in 2010 the infrastructure should be handed over to the State. In 1990, Iberdrola presented a new reform and expansion plan that would add to the existing plant, Ricobayo I, another new plant, Ricobayo II, with 151 MW. With this investment of 7651 million pesetas, the Government extended by 30 years the date on which Iberdrola would have to return the reservoir to the State, in 2040, so that it would enjoy its use for a total of 108 years, until 2040.\nHowever, Decree 1022/1964, of April 15, which approves the articulated text of the State Heritage Law, establishes that no concession can last more than 99 years, so that, regardless of what was agreed at the time by the Government of Felipe González, in any case the State will necessarily and inexcusably regain control of the plant at 00:00 hours on Sunday, February 5, 2034. At that time, the Government will be obliged by law to demolish the existing power plant, having exhausted its useful life, to return the land expropriated at the time to the descendants of its former owners and to restore the natural environment damaged by the reservoir, as established in the regulations currently in force. Under no circumstances will the extension of the concession or the maintenance of the dam be appropriate, since the regional, national and European environmental regulations in force require the demolition of this type of dam at the end of its concession period.\n\n\n=== Weir problems ===\nIts surface weir, about 700 m long and with a 14% slope, caused serious erosion, as the water filtered through a breach, the land sank and the spillway was consumed 350 m upstream, which meant that between 1933 and 1939 half of the mountain was badly eroded, causing a cazuela 100 m wide and 100 m deep, excavating approximately 1,136,000 m3 of rocks. The problems of this weir made it necessary in 1943 to build a Hydraulics Laboratory, the first R&D facility of its kind, in the village of Salto del Esla, to solve and study in a reduced model the problems derived from the large evacuations of water from the spillways. German professor Theodor Rehbock advised the Spanish engineers on the preliminary project.\n\n\n=== 2021 controversy ===\nIberdrola released more than 70% of the water stored in June and July 2021 to produce electricity, which meant a significant damage to the tourist companies in the area that offer activities linked to the reservoir, as their activity was significantly reduced. The controversy spread nationally at a time when the final price of electricity reached historic highs. The Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition, Teresa Ribera, described the maneuver as scandalous.\nThe price of electricity in the that system was fixed based on the most expensive energy source, at that time gas, at historic highs, so that other energies are paid at the price of gas, including renewable energies such as wind and hydroelectric power, which are much cheaper because they use natural resources. Therefore, the energy produced with the release of water has been paid at a price much higher than the cost of production. This system has been widely criticized because it maximizes the profits of the country's four major power companies.\n\n\n== Reservoir ==\nThe Salto de Ricobayo consists of a gravity dam, curved plant, 93 m high and 220 m long, and two power plants: one at the foot of the dam with 133 MW and a subway one, on the right bank, with 150 MW.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nArribes del Duero Natural Park\nDouro\nMuelas del Pan\nEsla (river)\nDouro International Natural Park\nRicobayo\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nState of the Ricobayo Dam (in Spanish).\nFile of the Ricobayo Dam by the Spanish Association of Dams and Reservoirs (in Spanish).",

        "content": "The Hiawatha impact structure is a probable impact structure discovered beneath the Hiawatha Glacier in northwest Greenland, from which it gets its name. It was identified using airborne radar surveys that showed the presence of a crater-like depression in the bedrock beneath the ice. Shocked quartz grains and melt rock clasts have been found in fluvio-glacial sediments deposited by a river that drains the area of the structure. The timing of the impact has been dated using argon-argon dating and uranium-lead dating of zircon crystals within the melt rock to 57.99 ± 0.54 million years ago, during the late Paleocene.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nIn 2016 airborne radar surveys were acquired by the Alfred Wegener Institute to investigate the morphology of the bedrock surface beneath the ice. The results of this dataset were combined with existing data acquired by NASA as part of their Program for Arctic Regional Climate Assessment and Operation IceBridge. A circular depression was evident in the bedrock surface, which coincides closely with a circular feature on the ice surface. Fieldwork was also carried out at the margin of the ice sheet in the summer of 2016 and evidence of an impact structure was found in sediment samples taken from the river draining the crater.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\nThe circular depression is about 31 km across and has a well-defined rim. The rim-to-floor depth is about 320 m and a broad central uplift has been identified with a prominence of 50 m. Two sub-glacial channels cut through the southeastern rim becoming poorly defined within the depression, before a single channel cuts the northwestern rim, carrying the outflow river.\n\n\n== Evidence of origin ==\nApart from the clearly-defined circular depression, the identification of the feature as an impact structure is based on field samples taken from fluvio-glacial sediments from the outwash deposits of the river that drains the crater. Initial samples from the 2016 fieldwork contained shocked quartz grains with multiple planar deformation features (PDFs). The observed orientation of the PDFs is consistent with a high pressure origin. Further analysis of samples taken in 2019 identified clasts of melt rock, containing shocked zircon grains.\n\n\n== Dating ==\nArgon-argon dating was used on quartz grains found in samples of fluvio-glacial sand. Grains were identified as probable melted quartz based on shape and colour. The resulting Ar-Ar age spectra gave saddle-shaped patterns for 29 out of the 50 grains. No well-developed plateau were seen in any of the samples but two gave \"mini-plateaus\" indicating Late Paleocene ages, consistent with the saddles from the other samples.\nUranium-Lead dating was used on both undeformed and shocked zircon grains found within the identified melt rock clasts sampled during field work in 2019. Undeformed Zircons gave ages generally consistent with the age of the regional basement geology, which is mainly Paleoproterozoic. The shocked zircons show clear evidence of being affected by a younger event, with an overall discordant age distribution, interpreted as partial resetting with a well-developed concordant plateau at the younger ages, indicating an age of about 58 million years ago for the impact.\nInitial interpretations of the crater having a much younger age, during the Pleistocene led to it being associated with the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. The Late Paleocene age is not directly associated with any clear climatic effects.\n\n\n== Impactor ==\nThe nature of the impactor responsible for the observed impact structure has been derived from field samples, which suggest that the asteroid responsible was a strongly fractionated iron type. For the size of crater observed, an impactor of about 1.5 km across is indicated.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 1848, she married Louis Édouard Vaudé, a banker in Troyes. Following their marriage, the couple used the surname Vaudé-Grin or Vaudé-Grinn as well as Vaudé-Green.\n\n\n== Photographic career ==\nIn 1855, the press reported the arrival of a new photography studio in Paris, called Photographie catholique, owned by \"Monsier Vaudé-Green\" and specialising in the \"reproduction sur papier des chefs-d’œuvre de la peinture religieuse\" (the paper reproduction of masterpieces of religious painting). The prints produced included reproductions of Peter Paul Rubens, Fra Bartolomeo and Nicolas Poussin, which were offered for sale at affordable cheap prices.\nA later article explains how the studio operated: \"The artists in the new studio are two ladies, Madame Vaudé-Green and one of her relatives. They take the negatives themselves and produce the positives with truly remarkable skill. Their main aim was to apply photography to works of religious art and to reproduce as accurately as possible the beautiful compositions that had inspired the great masters (...) If it was not possible for them to work on the painting themselves, Madame Vaudé-Green copied the most famous engravings.\" Madame Vaudé-Green was soon the only person to be mentioned in publicity material, neither her husband or relative appear after this time. Her high level of technical skill was remarked upon positively. Her Paris studio at this time was at 8 rue de Milan, in the 9th arrondissement of Paris.\nIn 1856, Vaudé-Green presented a large number of reproductions of engravings in Paris. More than two hundred religious works were offered in two different formats and sold by Parisian stationers and print shops. The press was effusive, with the quality and finesse of her work admired. Her work and role in popularising religious art among the general public was highlighted. This included a journalist in the English magazine Photographic Notes suggesting that one day photography might provide pleasant and profitable employment for many young girls otherwise destined to become overworked domestic workers or seamstresses. La Lumière magazine praised \"the considerable work accomplished by Mme Vaudé-Green and the intelligence with which she has chosen the finest gems in this magnificent jewel box of masterpieces\".\nThe same year, Vaudé-Green took part in the Exposition des arts industriels de Bruxelles de 1856 (Brussels Industrial Arts Exhibition), where she was awarded a medal, alongside fellow photographers Charles Nègre and Nadar Jeune. In 1859, she took part in the third exhibition of the Société française de photographie, where she showed reproductions of paintings, including a drawing after Paolo Veronese's The Wedding at Cana, and an interior view of a palace. The prints were created using a camera lens with a centralising cone, patented by Jamin in 1855. The critical reception was more mixed.\nAt the same time Vaudé-Green moved her studio to 36, rue d'Orléans-Batignolles, in Batignolles (later known as rue Legendre).\nBetween 1861 and 1863, she was involved in a dispute with Alphonse Bernoud, a French photographer living in Italy and a member of the Société française de photographie, who had used her professional services. The issue in question was whether or not Vaudé-Green had reproduced old paintings from the original, or re-photographed modern images. After this dispute, she stopped working as a photographer.\nMelina Vaudé-Green, died at the age of eighty on 9 June1902 in Mâcon, her husband having predeceased her.\n\n\n== Successors ==\nAround 1863, Vaudé-Green's studio was taken over by another woman photographer, Jeanne Laplanche who, with her architect husband Saint-Ange Laplanche, was based next door at 34, rue d’Orléans-Batignolles. The name Photographie catholique was retained. After the street was renamed, the studio's address became 87 rue Legendre.\nFew traces remain of Laplance's work, apart from some photo-cards and a series of views of the Maison pompéïenne of Prince Jérôme Napoléon on Avenue Montaigne, kept at the Musée Carnavalet.\nAround 1870, Jeanne Laplanche in turn sold the studio. It became the branch of another female photographer Angelina Trouillet who kept the name Photographie catholique until 1876.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe Bibliothèque nationale holds examples of Vaude-Green's work.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nQui a peur des femmes photographes?

These elections will take place as part of the statewide local elections.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== 2021 referendums ===\n\nAt the 2021 local elections, four referendum questions were put to voters  about directly-elected mayors.\nWhen asked if they supported the introduction of a directly-elected mayor in 2024, 72.7% voted \"Yes\" in Bega Valley and 76.2% voted \"Yes\" in Ryde. In Wagga Wagga, 50.6% voted \"No\" to the creation of a directly-elected mayor, the closest margin of any local referendum questions in 2021. In Griffith, voters were asked if they supported removing the direct mayoral election, to which 71.8% voted \"No\".\n\n\n=== Angelo Tsirekas dismissal ===\nOn 6 April 2022, it was announced Canada Bay mayor Angelo Tsirekas (Our Local Community) was under investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) over allegations he accepted benefits from developer I-Prosperity Group in return for \"favourable planning decisions\" dating back to 2012.\nTsirekas was suspended as mayor on 9 November 2023 after ICAC found he had engaged in corrupt conduct. It was found he received benefits including overseas flights and accommodation, worth at least $18,800, between 2015 and 2019.\nOn 13 December 2023, Tsirekas was dismissed as mayor by Minister for Local Government Ron Hoenig. He was banned from civic office for a period of five years. On 25 January 2024, Michael Megna (Liberal) was appointed by councillors to serve for the remainder of the term.\n\n\n== Candidates ==\nIncumbents are highlighted in bold text.\n\n\n=== Retiring mayors ===\nKay Fraser (Labor) − Lake Macquarie, announced 8 March 2024\nCarolyn Corrigan (Serving Mosman) − Mosman, announced 1 May 2024\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rosa Elena Curruchich (1958–2005) was a Maya Kaqchikel visual artist who was born in San Juan Comalapa, Guatemala. Her work was represented in the 60th Venice Biennale.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe primary focus on her work deals with the role of women in Indigenous social milieux. According to the Archives of American Art's special archive of women artists research & exhibitions, many researchers consider her to be San Juan Comalapa's first woman painter. Her paintings have been described as \"detailed and precise\"; some of the subjects of her paintings include religious festivals, traditional customs, weaving and other artisanal practices. Curruchich began exhibiting her art in 1979 after teaching herself to paint earlier in that decade. Her first exhibition took place in Guatemala City and sold out quickly. After returning to her home, however, she was attacked by a group that believed her success \"might actually take some of the capacity for earning money away from them.\" During the Guatemalan Civil War she painted on a small scale so as to easily and discreetly transport them. The miniature scale also allowed her to paint in secret. Each of her works include written text that describes the activities depicted in the painting.\n\n\n=== Exhibitions ===\nIn 1979, Curruchich work premiered at the French Institute in Guatemala City. Her early work documented and reclaimed \"the affective and political value of the parts of social life not often represented by male painters.\"\nIn addition to the Venice Biennale, Curruchich's work has been shown at the Kunsthalle Wien in Vienna. It has received critical attention from Artforum magazine, in addition to other publications. Miguel A. Lopez has written. \"Her work reveals the personal history and the way in which Indigenous women practise political actions through communal work, setting it apart from liberal, Western feminism.\"\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\nCurruchich was the granddaughter of Andrés Curruchich who was an important Chapin painter.\nCurruchich died in January of 2005 from diabetes complications.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nCurruchich's work is held in the collection of the Museum of International Folk Art.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Haverhill Arts Centre, formerly Haverhill Town Hall, is a former municipal building in the High Street in Haverhill, Suffolk, a town in England. The building, which is currently used as an events centre, is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was commissioned by Daniel and Caroline Gurteen, who were the proprietors of a textile manufacturing business at Chauntry Mills in Haverhill, as part of celebrations for their 50th wedding anniversary. The site they selected was on the southwest side of the High Street, close to Haverhill South railway station. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 11 April 1882. It was designed by Edward Sharman of Wellingborough in the Gothic Revival style, built in red brick with stone dressings at a cost of £5,000 and was officially opened as Haverhill Town Hall on 2 August 1883.\nThe building had a large hall on the first floor, while the ground floor accommodated a kitchen, toilets, and rooms for lectures, committee meetings, chess and billiards.  It also included a council chamber and the town's public library.  In May 1884, a large organ, designed and manufactured by James Jepson Binns, was installed in the hall. The hall was known for its public dances in the 1950s and 1960s, and for bingo and an annual pantomime in the 1970s and 1980s.  In the early 1990s, it was owned by the St Edmundsbury Borough Council, which converted it into an arts centre and re-opened it as such on 1 December 1994.\nIn 2004, control of the building passed to Haverhill Town Council.  In 2023, the arts centre initiated a self-produced pantomime for the first time: the production of Dick Whittington was written and directed by the centre's creative director, Dan Schumann, and starred the actor, Scott Wright. The building also houses the Haverhill Local History Museum, which has a collection of local memorabilia.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe building is constructed of red brick, with dressing of stone and glazed tile.  It has two storeys and an attic, with a slate roof.  Its main front is three bays wide, and has a projecting three-stage porch rising the full height of the building and surmounted by a gable. There is an arched opening with a hood mould in the first stage, an oriel window in the second stage and a tri-partite arched window with cusped heads and tracery in the third stage. The outer bays are fenestrated by pairs of windows with cusped heads. The side walls each have seven windows.  As built, there were also dormer windows, later removed.  The building was grade II listed in 1973.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The SCMR succeeded the Macedo-Romanian Committee (Romanian: Comitetul Macedo-Român), founded in 1860 in Bucharest in the United Principalities at the initiative of the immigrant Aromanian historian Dimitrie Cozacovici and under the patronage of Prince of Moldavia and Wallachia Alexandru Ioan Cuza.\nThe SCMR aims to preserve and cultivate the Aromanian language, culture, specific traditions and identity, including among the young generation. It promotes contacts and cultural ties with Aromanian communities everywhere and with the other peoples together with whom the Aromanians live. A nonprofit organization, the organization receives material and moral support from the Romanian state, having been legally recognized in the country as an association of public utility on 7 May 2008. The SCMR supports the traditional notion in Romania that the Aromanians are ethnic Romanians with some distinct particularities that should be preserved. It has the power to issue documents certifying civil status, including nationality certificates to help Aromanians obtain Romanian citizenship with considerably less bureaucratic effort.\nThe SCMR, together with the Romanian state itself, funded and supported the schools and publications for the Aromanians from which many renowned writers and creators of Aromanian literature emerged. It also supported churches for the Aromanians and printed and distributed manuals and worship books in both Aromanian and Romanian for free to support these institutions. The society published Albumul macedo-român (\"The Macedo-Romanian Album\"), founded in 1880 by the Romanian historian, academic and politician V. A. Urechia. It also published the weekly Revista Macedoniei (\"Macedonia's Magazine\"), which later merged with Românul de la Pind.\nThe society played an important role in the emission of the irâde-i seniyye (\"spoken will\") on 22 May 1905 by the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II that recognized the Ullah millet and thus gave the Aromanians the status of a separate ethnolinguistic group within the Ottoman Empire with its own specific rights. It also initiated the Meglenia Cultural Society for the Megleno-Romanians, which had similar objectives to the SCMR. The SCMR stopped its activities in 1948, without being formally disbanded. It was reactivated following the Romanian revolution in December 1989 after which several other cultural organizations of the Aromanians in Romania were also established. In 2019, the National Bank of Romania issued a commemorative coin for the 140th anniversary of the SCMR's founding.\nNotable members of the SCMR's board of directors have included Vasile Alecsandri, Dimitrie Brătianu, Ioan D. Caragiani, Ion I. Câmpineanu, Dimitrie Ghica, Ion Ghica, Titu Maiorescu, Iacob Negruzzi, C. A. Rosetti, Christian Tell and the aforementioned Urechia. Also relevant for the society's founding were Mihail Kogălniceanu and Calinic Miclescu. As of 2020, the president of the society was the Romanian Aromanian actor, director and politician Ion Caramitru.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Aromanian cultural organizations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Romanian)\nMacedo-Romanian Cultural Society on Facebook (in Romanian)",

        "content": "Dulag 121 camp in Pruszków (Durchgangslager 121 Pruszków) was a Nazi transit camp where civilian population from Warsaw and surrounding areas, expelled from their homes during and after the Warsaw Uprising, was gathered.\nThe camp was established on 6 August 1944, on the premises of the former Railway Rolling Stock Repair Works in Pruszków. It operated until mid-December 1944, and in a residual form, until 16 January 1945. During this period, between 390,000 and 410,000 people passed through Dulag 121, among whom tens of thousands were deported to forced labor in the depths of the Reich or sent to concentration camps after a short stay in the camp. Due to diseases, exhaustion, or at the hands of guards, hundreds to several thousand prisoners of Dulag 121 perished. However, over 30,000 people managed to leave the camp thanks to the assistance of the Polish personnel employed there.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe transit camp in Pruszków was established on the sixth day of the Warsaw Uprising (6 August 1944). It was created based on the order of SS-Obergruppenführer Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski (the commander of German forces designated to suppress the uprising), which was agreed upon two days earlier with the administrative authorities of the General Government. The first transport of expelled Warsaw residents arrived at the camp on August 7. It included about 5,000 survivors of the Wola massacre who were first gathered in the church of St. Adalbert and then driven on foot to Pruszków.\nThe establishment of the Pruszków camp was associated with a change in German plans regarding the fate of the inhabitants of the rebellious Warsaw. On the evening of 5 August 1944, Bach partially revoked Hitler's order from August 1, which commanded the total extermination of the city's inhabitants regardless of age or sex. Bach prohibited his units from killing women and children but maintained the order to eliminate all Polish men, both captured insurgents and civilians. This decision was not so much motivated by humanitarian concerns as by pragmatic calculation. Bach quickly realized that mass murders only increased the Poles' will to resist, and German soldiers engaged in killings, rape, and looting were unable to conduct offensive actions against the insurgents. Moreover, from the very beginning, he intended to suppress the uprising through a combination of political and military factors, fearing that the use of purely coercive measures would prevent him from achieving the main goal – namely, the rapid elimination of the dangerous hotspot behind the Eastern Front, which Warsaw engulfed in rebellion. On August 12, Bach further softened Hitler's order by issuing a prohibition on the killing of Polish civilian men. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, the economic aspect was also taken into account at that time. At this stage of the war, the Third Reich could not afford to waste such a large reservoir of potential labor. Therefore, extermination was replaced by the complete displacement of Warsaw's population. Contrary to official assurances that the aim of the displacement action was solely to ensure the safety of civilians by removing them from the front zone, the Germans were only interested in exploiting refugees as slave labor and plundering and destroying the city itself. According to the new guidelines, Dulag 121 camp in Pruszków was to serve as a transit camp for the displaced population of Warsaw. After a short stay in the camp, people fit for work were to be sent to farms, industrial plants, and camps in the Reich.\nDulag 121 was organized on the premises of the Railway Rolling Stock Repair Works located in the Żbików district of Pruszków. Several factors spoke in favor of choosing this location. In the fall of 1939, a transit camp for Polish prisoners of war was operational on the premises of the works, with a capacity of 2,000 people at that time. Later (from 20 January 1941), a labor camp for Jews was located there for a while. Thanks to this, in 1944, there were still elements of protective infrastructure (bunkers, guard towers) on the premises that could be adapted for the needs of the new camp. This place was also chosen due to its favorable location – a short distance from the capital and a convenient position on the railway line from Warsaw to Skierniewice, which allowed for efficient \"unloading\" of the camp. Dulag 121 was organized and supplied by the civilian administration of the General Government, but Bach exercised control over it.\nInitially, Dulag 121 operated in conditions of complete improvisation and chaos. The leadership rested in the hands of SA Oberführer Stephan and SA Sturmbannführer August Polland, who proved to be completely incapable of managing the camp and receiving the incoming transports. According to the testimony of a worker from the Main Welfare Council, Władysław Mazurek, Stephan, unable to efficiently lead the camp, after 2 or 3 days got drunk, beat people, quarreled with Germans, left the camp, and never returned. He was then replaced by Polland, who being almost constantly drunk, walked around the camp with a revolver in his hand, shooting and beating at every opportunity. The situation normalized somewhat only around August 10, with the arrival of a new crew consisting of Wehrmacht and SS soldiers.\n\n\n== Dulag 121 and its staff ==\nThe area of the Pruszków camp was 48 hectares. Its infrastructure consisted of nine large production halls and several smaller buildings. The camp was surrounded by a concrete wall with four gates. The German staff were quartered in the \"Palace\" office building and the former railway school building. The production halls served the following functions:\n\nHall No. 5 (wagon repair shop) served as a transitional space for the initial selection of the displaced. Additionally, according to some accounts, men considered fit for work were also gathered there.\nHall No. 1 (wagon repair shop) – this is where people deemed unfit for work, destined for dispatch to the General Government territories, were placed.\nHall No. 2 (technical services unit) – it housed the camp infirmary, sick bay, and a small infectious diseases hospital. A German medical commission also conducted \"selection\" of the displaced there, assessing their ability to work.\nHall No. 3 (blacksmith shop) – railway and tram workers with their families were accommodated there, and later on, men deemed fit for work.\nHall No. 4 (machine tool repair shop) – women deemed fit for work were placed there.\nHall No. 6 (locomotive shed) – men deemed fit for work were placed there, including individuals considered particularly dangerous by the Germans. Because of this, the hall was heavily guarded. Many people detained in Hall No. 6 were deported to concentration camps, including Mauthausen-Gusen. In September 1944, Hall No. 6 was dismantled, and fit-for-work individuals were subsequently directed to Halls No. 3 and 4.\nHall No. 7 (carpentry shop) initially served as a transitional space, and after the capitulation of Mokotów and Żoliborz, captured soldiers of the Home Army were placed there.\nHall No. 8 (ventilation unit) – from September 1944, it operated as a hospital where individuals suspected of infectious diseases were placed. Later, the hall served as accommodation for prisoners of war.\nHall No. 9 (construction warehouse) – it housed kitchens and warehouses.\nThe camp commander in Pruszków was Colonel Kurt Sieber, who oversaw a staff of about 100 soldiers from the Wehrmacht. In addition to Germans, the staff also included several dozen Soviet prisoners of war, who were used for cleanup work. Sieber, an \"old-fashioned\" officer, was characterized by a humane attitude towards the interned Poles in Pruszków. One of his first orders was to prohibit shooting within the camp.\n\nSieber – formally the commander of Dulag 121 – was practically responsible only for maintaining order in the camp and logistical matters. The fate of the prisoners, however, was decided by his deputies from the SS, namely SS-Sturmbannführer Gustaw Diehl and SS-Untersturmführer Wetke. Both resided in the so-called \"green wagon\", near which stood two freight cars serving as the camp's prison. Diehl was responsible for the functioning of the camp's counterintelligence, as well as for the selection of newcomers and organizing deportations. It was probably he who decided on the size and destination of each outgoing transport from the camp. In organizing selections and deportations, Diehl was supported by several officials from the Pruszków Labor Office, led by the notorious SA Sturmbannführer August Polland, known for his brutality. Władysław Mazurek recalled that Polland:With special animal satisfaction, tore families apart, and woe to those who, wanting to stay together, betrayed themselves with some imprudent word or behavior in his presence – they had to be torn apart, even if both had the same qualifications, and thus, for example, were suitable for work in the Reich, they did not leave together. For the joy of this executioner was the sight of inflicted pain, harm, tears, and despair. If he couldn't do anything else to a solitary person, he took away their beloved dog, the only companion after the loss of loved ones, a canary, or meager belongings.The chief medical officer of the camp was Stabsarzt Adolf König (from 12 August 1944), while his deputies were Stabsarzt Peter Klenner and – for a short time – Unterarzt Tössman. In November 1944, König left Dulag 121, and he was replaced as chief medical officer by Dr. Herbert Weigel, who held this position until the end of the camp's existence. Transiently, during the period of the greatest influx of people, several German military doctors also worked in the camp. Soviet prisoner-of-war medical personnel cared for individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis or infectious diseases. A small infectious diseases hospital was organized in Hall No. 2, with Dr. Aleksander Anikiejev as its head physician. Additionally, female Polish translators were assigned to assist the German medical personnel. German doctors generally displayed a fairly friendly attitude towards Poles, manifested in \"turning a blind eye\" to attempts to protect the displaced from deportation to the Reich (under the pretext of illness or disability). However, while German doctors prepared lists of individuals deemed unfit for work, the final decisions regarding release from the camp were always made by SS men from the \"green wagon\".\n\n\n=== Polish staff ===\nDulag 121, unlike other German camps, allowed external Polish medical and kitchen staff to work, who also enjoyed relative freedom. Polish services, distinguished from the crowd by white aprons with red cross bands, operated in the camp and took care of the wounded and sick, who were placed in both local hospitals and private apartments. Many members of the Polish staff were directed to Pruszków by the Polish Underground State.\nThe camp kitchen typically employed between 200 and 400 people, with nearly 480 workers at its peak. The kitchen staff was led by Ewa Maria Bogucka. The camp kitchen operated almost continuously, preparing daily between 20,000 and 25,000, occasionally even up to 35,000 half-liter portions of soup. Additionally, in the morning and evening, the kitchen staff tried to distribute food rations to the refugees, consisting of half a liter of grain coffee and 200–250 grams of rye bread. Mobile canteens were also organized on the camp premises (led by engineer Stanisław Zabielski), which provided the refugees with cigarettes, essential items, and additional food rations for purchase. The usefulness of these canteens is evidenced by the fact that during the period from September 25 to October 13, 1944, the canteen turnovers amounted to nearly 500,000 młynarkis.\nThe camp's medical services were staffed by dozens of volunteer doctors and nearly 300 nurses. Lieutenant Doctor Kazimierz  \"Bożymir I\" Szupryczyński – a railway doctor and head of the medical services of the VI District of the Home Army – directed all his medical staff and auxiliary staff of the Women's Military Service to help the displaced. Additionally, he engaged volunteers such as doctors and nurses from Pruszków. According to some sources, at the peak of its operations, the medical services of Dulag 121 employed about 500 people – including 102 doctors, 122 nurses, and numerous Daughters of Charity. The German authorities appointed Jadwiga Kiełbasińska, a midwife from Milanówek who spoke German fluently and enjoyed the full trust of the occupation authorities, as the head of the Polish medical staff. Kiełbasińska, illegally using the title of medical doctor, was not well-liked by the Polish staff. However, she tried to help the refugees without losing the trust of the Germans. Among other things, Kiełbasińska organized a hospital in the Perełka villa in Milanówek, where many insurgents were hidden with her knowledge.\nThere was also a group of men among the Polish staff who, under various pretexts, obtained the right to enter the camp premises. They usually worked as porters or carters (the camp stable had three horses and four carts). Additionally, each hall had its manager – a Hallenleiter – appointed to this position by the Pruszków delegation of the Main Welfare Council. The hall chief's function was associated with numerous privileges and allowed effective assistance to the refugees.\nThere were also the so-called \"golden sisters\" or \"white hyenas\" operating within the camp. These were women who, impersonating members of the Polish medical staff, extorted money and valuables from the refugees in exchange for alleged assistance in getting released from the camp. Some of them also worked as Gestapo informants. The remaining Polish camp staff tried to counteract the activities of the \"golden sisters\".\nThe Polish staff tried to protect the population from deportation to concentration camps or forced labor. For this purpose, efforts were made to classify as many displaced people as possible as \"wounded\" or \"sick\" (the \"diagnoses\" of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases were especially effective) – therefore unfit for work. Employment in the camp kitchen also protected against deportation (this is how literati Stanisław Dygat and Stefan Otwinowski were saved, among others). Displaced people were also removed from the camp in other, sometimes very risky ways – for example, by dressing them in uniforms of the Polish medical staff (this was possible until the Germans introduced the obligation for staff members to have passes with photos) or hiding them in wagons leaving the camp. Some refugees left Dulag under the pretext of employment in work teams carrying out cleaning work outside the camp or at night – through a small gate in the wall on Warsztatowa Street, to which Polish railwaymen had the key. In total, about 30,000 detainees were evacuated from the Pruszków camp. Additionally, as part of the \"Raków\" operation, railwaymen from Electric Commuter Rail facilitated the escape of nearly 1,000 people from transport.\nAmong the refugees liberated from the camp in this manner were many individuals who had made significant contributions to science, culture, or society, and even members of the resistance movement. Through the efforts of the Polish staff, the following were freed: former President of the Republic of Poland Stanisław Wojciechowski; government delegate for the Warsaw Voivodeship Józef \"Niemira\" Kwasiborski; eleven professors from the Warsaw University of Technology; writers Tadeusz Breza, Stanisław Dygat, Wilam Horzyca, Stefan Otwinowski, Maria Rodziewiczówna, and Jerzy Zawieyski; columnist Stefan \"Wiecha\" Wiechecki; graphic artist Eryk Lipiński; Professor Walery Goetel (rector of the AGH University of Krakow); figures from the film industry such as Antoni Bohdziewicz (director and screenwriter) and Marian Wyrzykowski (actor and director), and many others. Due to their advanced age, individuals like Wincenty Tomaszewicz were released. However, assisting prisoners was associated with significant risk. Many members of the Polish staff were punished with the revocation of passes and arrest. Several people were deported to concentration camps. Additionally, there are records of four cases where Germans murdered people who were aiding the refugees.\nWhile the Polish staff had many means to provide temporary assistance to the refugees, they had little influence on the overall situation in the camp. In particular, they were strictly prohibited from participating in \"selections\" and forming transports destined for the depths of the Third Reich.\n\n\n== Camp operation ==\nThe influx of people to Dulag 121 was highly irregular and depended on the situation on the insurgent fronts. Transportations with displaced Varsovians usually arrived at the camp parallel to the Germans' conquest of individual districts of the capital:\n\nAugust 7–8: from Wola;\nAugust 9–14: from Ochota;\nAugust 19–September 13: from Praga;\nAugust 22: from Sielce and Lower Mokotów;\nAugust 24: from the vicinity of Krakowskie Przedmieście;\nAugust 31–September 5: from the Old Town;\nSeptember 2–3: from Sadyba;\nSeptember 5–9: from Powiśle;\nSeptember 12–17: from Bielany and Marymont;\nSeptember 14–23: from Solec;\nSeptember 25–28: from Old Mokotów;\nSeptember 28 – October 1: from Żoliborz;\nOctober 2–10: from Śródmieście.\nThe inhabitants from the nearest areas of Warsaw were also evacuated to the camp in Pruszków: Anin, Babice, Bemowo, Boernerowo, Jelonki, Kobyłka, Łomianki, Młociny, Tłuszcz, Ursus, Wawer, Wawrzyszew, Włochy, and Zielonka, as part of the German plan to thin out the Polish population within a 35-kilometer radius from the capital.\nIn the early days of Dulag 121's existence, the refugees were driven on foot to Pruszków. In the following weeks, they were brought by train, usually from Warszawa Zachodnia station. Varsovians were brought to Pruszków by both the Skiernewice Railway trains and EKD trains. The latter stopped in Pruszków, from where their passengers (usually brought from the Zieleniak market in Ochota) were driven to the camp through the city by foot along a three-kilometer route. The Skiernewice Railway trains, on the other hand, were unloaded on the premises of Dulag 121 – near gate no. 14. By the end of August and in September 1944, several dozen passenger (from 3 to 6 carriages) and freight trains arrived at the camp daily. Typically, there were between 5,000 and 40,000 refugees in Pruszków at one time. A massive influx occurred after the fall of the Old Town, when around 75,000 refugees ended up in Dulag 121. However, the largest number of refugees arrived at the camp after the capitulation of the Warsaw Uprising. During this time, nearly 150,000 people passed through Dulag 121.\nDulag 121 was unable to accommodate all the refugees. To partially relieve the overcrowded Pruszków camp, the Germans were forced to temporarily create several sub-camps in neighboring towns. These included Ursus (on the premises of the National Engineering Works), Piastów (in the rubber factory Tudor and Piastów), Ożarów Mazowiecki (in the cable factory and glassworks), Włochy (in the Era factory), Skierniewice (Dulag 142), and Grodzisk Mazowiecki. The supervision over these camps was exercised by the command of Dulag 121 in Pruszków, specifically SS-Sturmbannführer Diehl. The camps in Ursus and Piastów operated in the first weeks of October 1944. After the capitulation of the uprising, they accommodated nearly 50,000 civilian residents of Warsaw. Meanwhile, captured soldiers of the Home Army were taken to transit camps in Ożarów (operating from October 4 to 15, 1944) and Skierniewice. Approximately 11,668 and 3,000 prisoners passed through these camps respectively.\nOn 20 August 1944, Dulag 121 was visited by Auxiliary Bishop of Warsaw, Bishop Antoni Szlagowski. He intervened in the camp's command demanding the release of imprisoned clergymen and respecting the principle of not separating families. Despite the promises made by the Germans, the situation of the refugees did not change. The camp authorities only agreed to release the imprisoned clergymen and allowed three priests to serve as camp chaplains.\nOn 5 September 1944, the camp was visited by SS-Obergruppenführer von dem Bach. Nurse Kazimiera Drescher, accompanying him as an interpreter, did not allow the camp's SS officers to interrupt her and described the actual situation to Bach. He assured her that the irregularities had occurred without his consent and gave his word that they would be rectified. However, no changes were made at Dulag 121, and Sister Drescher, along with two other staff members, was \"punished\" by being sent to Auschwitz. By the end of the day, the Polish Central Welfare Council delegation was forced to sign a declaration prepared by the Germans, stating that the \"liberated\" population of Warsaw residing in the transit camp in Pruszków was living under conditions allowed by local resources, had sufficient food, medical and spiritual care, and no abuses were taking place. The Germans threatened to remove the Polish personnel from the camp if the Central Welfare Council staff refused to sign the declaration. This threat prompted the Polish delegation to sign the statement. Later, in a modified form, it was published in the daily newspaper Nowy Kurier Warszawski.\nOn 18 September 1944, a two-person delegation from the International Red Cross, led by Dr. Paul Wyss (a Swiss citizen), arrived at the camp. The Germans then improvised a comfortable transport for the refugees. Passenger cars were waiting on the platforms, some halls were cleaned up (with part of the population removed in advance), and the prisoners were given better meals. Dr. Jadwiga Oszkielowa, who despite threats from the Germans presented the Red Cross delegates with the true situation of the refugees, was punished by having her access card to the camp revoked. She was also threatened with arrest. After the departure of the Red Cross representatives, the situation in the camp returned to its previous state.\nAfter the capitulation of the insurgent forces in Mokotów, the first transport of prisoners of war arrived at the Pruszków camp, including around 1,200 officers and soldiers of the Home Army. They were accommodated in Hall No. 7. A few days later, around 1,000 Home Army soldiers captured on Żoliborz were brought to Dulag 121. Civilian refugees were strictly prohibited from maintaining contact with the prisoners. On the same day when the transport from Mokotów arrived, the SS officers severely beat a few prisoners. The Home Army soldiers were then rescued by the intervention of Wehrmacht officers. However, all prisoners were ordered to remove the eagles from their insurgent berets and uniforms. Those who resisted had the eagles forcibly removed with knives.\nIn mid-October 1944, the Germans essentially ceased the expulsion of the left-bank Warsaw population. On 5 November 1944, the Pruszków camp was officially closed, and from that moment, its gradual liquidation began. The activity of the outpatient clinic was limited, and on December 12, the former Wehrmacht crew left Dulag 121. Control over the camp was then taken over by the local gendarmerie and the labor inspectorate. In reality, the camp continued to function, albeit to a limited extent. Primarily, it imprisoned victims of roundups conducted at railway stations or in suburban towns. On November 15, a transport of so-called \"Robinson Crusoes of Warsaw\" (people hiding in the ruins of the city despite the end of the fighting) arrived at the camp after being caught during a large roundup. Additionally, around 400 Polish men were held in barrack No. 13, transported by cars to Warsaw, where they were forced to work on dismantling and transporting equipment, raw materials, tools, cultural goods, furniture, furs, clothing, and bedding looted by the Germans. The camp also served as a warehouse for looted goods. As a result, around 700 prisoners were still in Dulag 121 on 10 January 1945. The transit camp in Pruszków finally ceased to exist on 16 January 1945, when the German crew fled from the approaching Red Army, and the last prisoners left the unguarded camp.\n\n\n== Conditions in the camp ==\n\nThe refugees brought to the camp had to jump off the wagons amidst shouts and pushes, as there were no platforms at the Pruszków siding. Then, amidst a corridor of Germans, they were driven into one of the nine production halls. Guards were not allowed to assist the sick, injured, or elderly when disembarking from the wagons and carrying loads. Only Polish personnel recruited by the Central Welfare Council could take care of this, but their numbers were too few considering the size of the transports. The halls where the refugees were placed were surrounded by barbed wire and supervised by German posts. Leaving the halls was prohibited, so only Polish personnel could move relatively freely within the camp. There were incidents where people standing too close to the fence were harassed by dogs. German agents and military patrols searched the crowd of refugees for hidden Home Army soldiers.\nThe conditions in the camp were very harsh. The individual halls, each of which had to accommodate from 2,000 to 5,000 refugees, were completely unsuitable for habitation. There was a constant stench and such overcrowding that it was often difficult to even find a place to sit. Each hall had inspection trenches filled with rotting waste and vermin, which were not cleaned or even lime-washed for two months. There were shortages of bunks, so the refugees had to nestle on muddy concrete floors, among puddles of water; piles of rags, garbage, and debris; scattered in disorder planks, rails, sheet metal, or parts of repaired wagons. The worst conditions prevailed in the locomotive shed (Hall No. 6), where the Germans placed individuals deemed particularly dangerous. The floors there were covered with oil, grease, and slag. Some straw was scattered in the halls, but it quickly rotted, becoming a breeding ground for lice and other pests. During the peak overcrowding of the camp, the conditions were so harsh that some of the population preferred to camp outdoors, especially in Hall No. 1, regardless of the cold, and often rain.\nStandard rations consisted of half a liter of coffee plus 200–250 grams of rye bread for breakfast and supper, and half a liter of soup for lunch. The Polish staff tried to increase and diversify these meager rations as much as possible (organizing, for example, milk soup for children). Up to 480 workers were employed in the camp kitchen, but despite this, hunger prevailed because even when there was no shortage of food, kitchen workers could not keep up with its distribution due to a lack of plates and spoons. Although the nights became colder with each passing day, the halls were not heated. Due to the lack of basic sanitary facilities, it was impossible even to wash hands, let alone maintain cleanliness. Non-potable industrial water flowed from a few taps. Due to the small number of latrines, the population had to relieve themselves in inspection trenches. As a result, the floors of the halls quickly became covered with water and excrement. Pediculosis was widespread in the camp. The refugees also mass contracted typhus and dysentery. The situation was worsened by the fact that people were brought to the camp, especially in the final phase of the Warsaw Uprising and after its capitulation, who were starving; camping for weeks among ruins and basements without water and light; sick, injured, and burned; individuals physically and mentally exhausted; women who were victims of rape, etc.\nGerman doctors generally did not deal with treating the sick and injured, limiting themselves to selecting refugees based on their ability to work. They did not usually examine the sick – they only assessed the patient's appearance, compared it with the diagnosis issued by Polish doctors, and then listened to descriptions of the symptoms of the disease provided by interpreters. As a result, the burden of caring for the sick and injured fell primarily on the Polish medical personnel, whose members sometimes had to work almost 24 hours a day. In Hall No. 2, a sick room and the aforementioned small infectious disease hospital were organized. Initially, one modestly equipped pharmacy served as the hospital equipment. Later, a hospital equipped with basic instruments for simple procedures was organized on the premises of Hall No. 8. More serious cases were referred to the hospital in Tworki, which provided the basic medical facilities for Dulag 121. The Tworki hospital, which previously could accommodate 800 patients at once, had to accommodate up to 4,000 patients during the Warsaw Uprising. The wounded and sick were also directed to other Pruszków hospitals – the county hospital on Piękna Street (accepted several hundred patients) and the hospital in \"Wrzesina\" (accepted about a thousand patients). However, they quickly became overcrowded, so refugees released from the camp due to their health were also directed to the hospital in Milanówek (no further information on its functioning), as well as to provisional hospital points organized in Brwinów, Grodzisk Mazowiecki, Komorów, Konstancin, Laski, Okęcie, Piastów, Podkowa Leśna, Ursus, and Włochy. Wounded insurgents hidden among the crowd of refugees were tried to be placed in private apartments. In total, at least 55 hospitals, emergency hospital points, and ambulatory and first-aid points were organized in the vicinity of Warsaw, where help was provided to the refugees from Warsaw. Many women who were victims of rape were also brought to Dulag 121. In Komorów, the doctors of the Pruszków camp organized free abortion procedures for them.\nIn Pruszków, the refugees usually stayed from two to seven days, and sometimes only a few hours. Their fate was decided by selection carried out by the Gestapo, and the time of stay in the camp – the transport schedule. People unable to work (women with children under 15 years of age, pregnant women, women over 50 years of age, men over 60 years of age, people with visible disabilities or deformities) were sent to various regions of the General Government and left there without means of subsistence. People deemed able to work (men aged 15 to 60 and women aged 15 to 50) were directed to forced labor in the depths of the Reich. Thousands of people were also deported to concentration camps. SS-Sturmbannführer Diehl maintained that all women were taken to the Reich for normal employment in agriculture or industry, and men – depending on the results of the investigation – were sent to forced labor or concentration camps. In reality, the destination of the transport was often decided by chance, and women and children were sent to concentration camps as well as men. For example, at the end of August 1944, the head of the Reich Security Main Office, SS-Obergruppenführer Ernst Kaltenbrunner, recommended to the command of Army Group Center that, due to serious reasons of police security, the basic mass of able-bodied men and women from Warsaw should be directed to work in concentration camps. Only women with small children could be treated as Polish civilian workers and placed at the disposal of the Main Commissioner for Mobilization of Labor. As a result of this order, many residents of the Old Town, which was being captured at that time, were sent to concentration camps.\nIn the first days of the camp's operation, the German guards behaved very brutally. At that time, sporadic incidents of Poles being murdered in the camp area occurred. During this period, there were also particularly numerous transports to concentration camps. Both individuals destined for camps and those sent to forced labor were taken from Pruszków in sealed wagons. After the Wehrmacht took control of the camp, the refugees were treated more correctly, although there were still cases of prisoners being beaten. After 15 August 1944, the sealing of wagons, which were sent only under guard, was also discontinued. The selections conducted by the Germans in Pruszków were, however, very brutal, and they were carried out hastily and superficially. Families were regularly separated. During the formation of transports leaving Pruszków, the population was packed into wagons in such a crush that cases of suffocation or crushing occurred. Those unable to work were distributed in open coal wagons. Usually, the refugees embarked on a journey of several days without water and food. It was very rare for Polish personnel to manage to reach the railway siding and provide the departing ones with small supplies for the road. One day, near the \"green wagon\", Polish workers overheard a conversation between SS men who, having dispatched a transport to the Reich without water and food, wondered aloud how many of the deported would arrive alive at their destination.\n\n\n=== Rescue mission ===\nWith the consent of the Germans, the care for the population gathered in the Pruszków camp was provided by the Main Welfare Council and the Polish Red Cross, which partially alleviated the difficult situation of the refugees. As early as 6 August 1944, the German commissioner of the city of Pruszków, Walter Bock, summoned representatives of the Pruszków branch of the Main Welfare Council – the chairman, Father Edward Tyszka (parson of St. Kazimierz's parish in Pruszków), and board members: Władysław Mazurek and Dr. Kazimierz Szupryczyński. During the meeting, which was also attended by the district governor of Warsaw, Hermann Rupprecht, and the head of the Pruszków Arbeitsamt, August Polland, Bock informed the Polish attendees about the establishment of the camp, instructing them to organize assistance for the refugees from Warsaw, which the German authorities allegedly could not provide. Blankets, bedding, kitchen utensils, and food were allowed to be brought into the camp. On the same day, priests from Pruszków's pulpits appealed to the population to help the refugees. Local welfare committees and the Red Cross provided collected products for the camp's needs.\nThe Pruszków branch of the Main Welfare Council set up a camp kitchen at Dulag 121 and began to collect food supplies. It also organized the transport of the wounded, sick, and infirm, and together with the Red Cross, it began to organize first aid. Some employees were permanently seconded to the camp. A special \"postal\" service was established, which delivered packages (up to 300 per day) and correspondence to the camp, as well as collected letters written by people in the camp to their families outside the walls. In early September 1944, a 25-person Registration and Information Department (headed by Teofil Cichoński) was also established at the Pruszków branch of the Main Welfare Council, which created a file containing data on missing persons, deported to the Reich, and family members conducting their search. The Polish camp personnel assisted in gathering information about the missing. Additionally, members of the Main Welfare Council or the Military Women's Service were on duty at railway stations between Warszawa Zachodnia Station and Pruszków, trying to provide drinks and food to the refugees, as well as, whenever possible, taking out of the transports young people, sick or injured individuals, women with children, etc.\nThe Main Welfare Council and the Red Cross were not the only Polish organizations organizing aid for the refugees from Warsaw. Fundraising and donations were organized by the Railway Social Care under the direction of Stanisław Pieścik and Józef Zieliński, the Volunteer Fire Brigade, local consumer cooperatives, as well as Catholic parishes and orders with their Caritas branches. Assistance to the refugees was spontaneously provided by the inhabitants of Pruszków and nearby towns. In response to the appeal announced in churches, the city's residents began to bring ready-made meals, mess kits, bowls and cutlery, kitchen utensils, and blankets to the camp. Farmers shared their harvests. Many volunteers from Pruszków approached Father Tyszka, declaring their willingness to work in the camp.\nThe structures of the Polish Underground State also participated in the aid mission for the prisoners of Dulag 121. The commander of the Pruszków VI district of the Home Army, Major Edward \"Paweł\" Rzewuski, handed over the mobilization reserve: 20 tons of potatoes, 10 tons of flour, a ton of sugar, as well as several hundred kilograms of bacon and lard. The Pruszków branch of the Main Welfare Council received through the county Government Delegate from 100 to 150 thousand PLN weekly for the aid to the prisoners of Dulag 121. The underground authorities and the Red Cross board collectively donated about 2 million PLN for this purpose. Members of the Military Women's Service also handled the transport of medications collected by the Main Welfare Council's Kraków headquarters. Every week, from 10 to 16 Girl Scouts arrived in Pruszków with backpacks full of medicines.\nOn 24 August 1944, the insurgent radio station Błyskawica broadcast a message and a letter from Pruszków in four languages, which contained an appeal to the International Red Cross for quick assistance to the 100,000 elderly and children held in the camp. The appeals were repeated in the following days. Already on August 25, the insurgent broadcast was retransmitted by Polish Radio in London, followed by the Anglo-Saxon press. In mid-September, two wagons with donations from the International Red Cross arrived at the camp from Geneva: food, children's clothing, and medicines, which saved many lives.\n\n\n== Victims ==\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how many residents of Warsaw and its vicinity passed through the camp in Pruszków. During the uprising, the Main Welfare Council reported that around 685,000 refugees were sent to Dulag 121 and its sub-camps. This was an approximate number and not based on individual lists. In the following years, Polish and German historiography could not agree on the actual number of prisoners in the Pruszków camp. According to German sources, it was around 350,000 people, while Polish sources suggested nearly 550,000. Especially in Poland, the latter number became entrenched in public consciousness for a long time. A breakthrough came with the publication in 2006 of the memoirs of Anna Danuta Sławińska (née Leśniewska), a Polish interpreter in Pruszków, who, based on her own observations and German statistics, estimated that between 390,000 and 410,000 residents of Warsaw passed through Dulag 121.\nThe exact number of victims of the Pruszków camp is not known. Mortality in the camp increased as transports arrived from the districts of Warsaw that resisted the longest. The population, camping in ruins and basements for weeks without sufficient water and food, arrived in Pruszków in a state of extreme physical and mental exhaustion. Many refugees, especially the elderly, children, and the sick, could not cope with the camp conditions. For example, on 3 September 1944, eight small children being held in Hall No. 1 died. A large percentage of deaths occurred, especially during the influx of transports from the districts of the Old Town, Powiśle Czerniakowskie, Wola, and Śródmieście. Between September 3 and October 27, 1944, only 66 people died in the camp. The camp chaplain, Father Marian Sikora, issued 43 death certificates at that time (including two for people shot while attempting to escape). Among these 66 deceased, there were victims of a train accident that occurred in the camp on September 9, resulting in the death of 10 people and injuries to 12.\nOn the territory of Dulag 121, there were cases of murdering young men suspected of participating in the uprising. Executions were also carried out by the Germans when attempting to escape from the camp or transport. Four or five executions of prisoners brought from Warsaw took place near the road in Piastów, at the so-called Papiernia. Prisoners of Dulag 121 were also shot near the clay pits Hosera in Pruszków's Żbików (the number of victims is unknown), in the Potulicki Park in Pruszków (several victims), and near the village of Kanie (around 30 people were allegedly shot there on August 9). There are also reports that in mid-August 1944 (a few days after the opening of the Pruszków camp), two trucks carrying around 30–50 Poles were brought to the clay pits in Pruszków (at Lipowa Street), who were then shot. A lightly wounded man survived the execution, and he was saved in the Wrzesin hospital located a few hundred meters from that place. The victims probably came from the youth detention center of the Michaelites in Struga near Warsaw. A large group of the center's residents and caretakers were shot on August 8 in the Saxon Garden. According to the account of the center's manager – Father Jan Zawada (based on the testimony of Polish Armed Forces Captain Stanisław Maciejewski) – those residents of the center who were not killed on August 8 were brought to Pruszków, where they were executed on the evening of August 9.\nAfter the war, 82 unknown Warsaw insurgents and 50 civilians (including 23 women and 8 children) were exhumed from the graves on the camp's territory and transferred to the cemetery in Pruszków on 27 April 1945. From an imitative list compiled by Polish Red Cross employees, it follows that by November 1944, 1,559 refugees from Warsaw were buried in suburban cemeteries. It is known that 512 people from Dulag 121, who died between 16 August 1944, and 17 March 1945, rest in the cemetery in Tworki. In the cemetery in Gołąbki in Ursus, there are graves of 70 known individuals and 40 unknown Warsaw residents. In Milanówek, 295 people who died between September 1944 and July 1945 are buried. In turn, the remains of 34 refugees (these are people who died between September 5 and November 30, 1944, including Aleksander Janowski, one of the founders of the Polish Tourist Society) are buried in the cemetery in Komorowo. These are not all burial places for expelled and deceased Warsaw residents. The number of Dulag 121 prisoners who died from diseases or exhaustion may therefore reach several thousand.\nEdward Serwański stated (in his work entitled Dulag 121 – Pruszków. August–October 1944) that: Pruszków is a special crime. Its proper character consists primarily of the fact of massing several hundred thousand people, physically exhausted, spiritually exhausted, stripped of everything, and placed in extremely primitive conditions, in a situation where it was almost impossible to organize aid action, and the aim of this was ruthless, brutal segregation, separating families, sending people in transports without food and drink, for forced labor to the German Reich.\n\n\n== Dulag 121 Museum ==\n\nOn 1 October 2010, a solemn opening ceremony of the Dulag 121 Museum took place, under the honorary patronage of the then Marshal of the Sejm, Bronisław Komorowski. The museum's purpose is to commemorate the martyrdom of the inhabitants of Warsaw imprisoned in the camp and to express gratitude to the people of Pruszków and the surrounding areas for their sacrifice and assistance to the refugees. The Dulag 121 Museum is located on the site of the former camp, in a building specially designed for this purpose. The museum's exhibitions were created in cooperation with the Warsaw Rising Museum.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDatner, Szymon (1962).

        "content": "Erica Reid Underwood  (26 June 1907 – 1 February 1992) was an Australian expert in child psychology who became a radio broadcaster. She was recognised with an MBE for her community work.\n\n\n== Life ==\nUnderwood was born in Albany in 1907. Her mother, Jessie Reid (born Clough), was born in Scotland and her father William Jenkins Chandler was a teacher born in Queensland.\nFrom 1944 her friend Catherine King's radio program broadcast by the ABC each day was the ABC Women's Session. In the late 1940s, Underwood joined King and contributed talks and deputised when necessary. Her particular talent was her expertise in child psychology. The program was broadcast throughout Western Australia and included music, live interviews and discussion on subjects from science and arts to cooking and parenting. It was based on the premise that women at home were thinking people with wide interests and concerns. King and Underwood travelled in regional WA in an ABC van meeting women who listened to the program.\nIn 1974 the Western Australian Institute of Technology, which would become Curtin University, employed Underwood as the first woman on the establishment's council. She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1978 New Year Honours in recognition of her work in radio, education and for the community.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nUnderwood died in the Perth suburb of Shenton Park in 1992. Curtin University's student accommodation includes Erica Underwood House which houses over 300 students. Her name was chosen because she was the first woman on their council and because she was the first person trained to be a psychologist in Western Australia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at ADB",

        "content": "Walter Saxer (born 1947) is a Swiss film producer, production manager, screenwriter, and film director, born in 1947 in St. Gallen.\nAt the age of 20, Walter Saxer met Werner Herzog and became a unit production manager in Herzog's debut Even Dwarves Started Small. A long-time collaborator, in the following years Saxer produced Herzog's Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972), The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (1974), Stroszek (1977), and Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979). Saxer's credits as producer include more than 22 films, he also wrote the script of the Scream of Stone. His most known project is Fitzcarraldo, a film that is considered one of the most difficult productions in the history of cinema.\nSaxer's sole work as director is a 1987 documentary Sepa: Nuestro Señor de los milagros. The film tells the story of Sepa, an experimental open-air penal prison established in 1951 by the Peruvian government as part of a programme to colonize the Amazon. The colony was situated on a 37,000 ha territory in the wild Peruvian jungle where the convicted had to establish their settlement and survive on their own. Referred to as ‘green hell’ by former inhabitants, in Sepa the prisoners were allowed to be joined by their families and were often on good terms with the guardians. Sepa was shut down in the early 1990s and left almost no traces, Saxer's film became the sole audiovisual evidence of its existence. The story is narrated by Mario Vargas Llosa. The film was shown only once on Swiss TV in the 1980s. Decades later, the restored version of Sepa: Nuestro Señor de los milagros premiered in Spain during the 2021 Play-Doc film festival in Tui, Galicia.\nIn the mid 90's Saxer moved to the city of Iquitos, where he dedicated himself to managing a small hotel called La Casa Fitzcarraldo.\n\n\n== References ==",

The ceremony took place on July 31, 2007, and was attended by Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo and ex-rebel leader Guillaume Soro. Several West African leaders, such as Amadou Toumani Touré, Blaise Compaoré, Yayi Boni, Faure Gnassingbé, Nino Vieira, and Thabo Mbeki attended the inaugural ceremony.\n\n\n== Event ==\nThe event took place at the Stade de la Paix in Bouaké, a rebel stronghold during the five-year civil war. Tens of thousands of people were present in the stadium, many wearing shirts that said \"Flame of Peace, Bouake 2007, I was there\". The ceremony marked Gbagbo's first time in the northern part of the country since the start of the civil war. The flame of peace made its way from Tiébissou, in the country's center, and ended at the stadium. When it reached the stadium, former Ivorian chief of staff Philippe Mangou and ex-rebel chief of staff Soumaila Bakayoko received the flame. A 105 mm artillery weapon was then sawed in half in the center of the stadium, and several small arms were thrown into an incinerator. Gbagbo and Soro each handed the other a weapon and declared their intent for peace, and Mangou and Bakayoko did the same. Afterwards, the flame of peace was passed between all four leaders and subsequently the visiting West African leaders.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCÔTE-D'IVOIRE.

        "content": "The Fakiyska reka (Bulgarian: Факийска река) is a 87 km long river in eastern Bulgaria that flows into Lake Burgas, which drains into the Black Sea. \nThe river takes its source under the name Garkova reka at an altitude of 463 m in the western part of the Strandzha mountain range, some 1.7 km north of the village of Strandzha just north of the Bulgaria–Turkey border. It initially flows in a deforested valley direction north until the village of Momina Tsarkva, northeast until Fakiya and east until Golyamo Bukovo. It then enters a deep, narrow and forested valley with many meanders, which separates the Strandzhan ridges of Karatepe to the northwest and Bosna to the southeast. Downstream of the abandoned village of Rakov Dol the valley widens and downstream of Zidarovo enters the Burgas Plain, where the Fakiyska reka forms a wide alluvial valley. It flows into Lake Mandrensko some 1.5 km southwest of the village of Dimchevo. The lake itself drains into the Gulf of Burgas in the Black Sea. \nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 641 km2. It borders the basins of the Sredetska reka to the northwest, the Veleka and the Izvorska reka to the southeast, the three flowing into the Black Sea, as well as the basins of the Tundzha and the Maritsa to the southwest that belong to the Aegean Sea drainage. The river has predominantly rain feed with high water in February–March and low water in August–October. The average annual flow at Zidarovo is 4.84 m3/s.\nThe Fakiyska reka springs from Yambol Province but flows almost entirely in Burgas Province. There are five villages along its course, Momina Tsarkva, Fakiya and Golyamo Bukovo in Sredets Municipality and Zidarovo and Gabar in Sozopol Municipality. Its waters are utilised for irrigation and industrial supply for the Promet Steel factory in the town of Sredets that manufactures hot rolled steel products. \n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

He was the mayor of Vilvestre in the Province of Salamanca from 1979 to 1995, a member of the provincial deputation for the same years, and a member of the Senate of Spain from 1986 to 2000.\nBorn in Cerezal de Peñahorcada, he was a member of the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) before moving to the People's Alliance (AP) in the early 1980s, which then became the People's Party (PP). In 1991, he obtained the first right-leaning majority in the provincial deputation (13 of 25 seats), but was not installed as president as the 11 from the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) obtained the support of the one CDS deputy and José Jesús Dávila Rodríguez, from Hernández Calvo's own party. The Davilazo incident was condemned by PP founder Manuel Fraga as \"the greatest shame since Viriathus's betrayal\".\nFrom 1993, Hernández Calvo's power base in the party in the province was weakened due to the rise of young figures Julián Lanzarote, Alfonso Fernández Mañueco and Gonzalo Robles. Between 1995 and Hernández Calvo's death, the PP retained hegemony in both municipal and provincial politics in Salamanca.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The São Paulo School of Dance (Portuguese: Escola de Dança de São Paulo - EDASP), also known as the São Paulo Municipal Theater Dance School (Escola de Dança do Theatro Municipal de São Paulo - EDTMSP) or the Municipal Ballet School (Escola Municipal de Bailado), is located in the Brazilian city of São Paulo. It is linked to the training center of the São Paulo Municipal Theater Foundation. \nCurrently run by Cristiana de Souza, the school is based in Praça das Artes and caters to around 800 students. It is one of the most traditional dance schools in Brazil and has trained generations of artists.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe São Paulo School of Dance was inaugurated on May 2, 1940, under the administration of Mayor Francisco Prestes Maia, as the Experimental School of Classical Dance (Escola Experimental de Dança Clássica). The aim was to establish an amateur corps de ballet focused on romantic classical ballet in order to meet the choreographic demands of the national and foreign operatic productions at the São Paulo Municipal Theater. In the first month, the group premiered the opera Aida.\nIt operated in one of the rooms at the Municipal Theater. In 1943, the school was transferred to the lower level of the Viaduto do Chá due to the need for more space to accommodate the growing number of students. Initially, it offered a course in Classical Dance for Children and Young People. In 1952, Musical Initiation and Dance History were added. In 1957, Decree No. 3,431 regulated the 8-year training course.\nIn the 1970s, it became known as the Municipal Ballet School (Escola Municipal de Bailado) and included Modern Dance as a language of expression. At the beginning of the 1980s, a new teaching program focusing on dance awareness, both physically and intellectually, was created. Decree No. 21.988 of 1986 established the Municipal Youth Dance Corps, which provided a unique artistic development opportunity for the school's students. Decree No. 30.593 of 1991 introduced the subjects of Music, Art History, Modern Technique and Improvisation into the curriculum.\nIn 1987, Jânio Quadros, then mayor of the city of São Paulo, abolished the course and banned homosexuals from entering the school. After criticizing the measure, Klauss Vianna, a dancer and former director of the school, was attacked in front of his house. In 2011, it was renamed São Paulo School of Dance (Escola de Dança de São Paulo) after the creation of the São Paulo Municipal Theater Foundation. Since 2014 it has been based in the Praça das Artes building.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTourism in the city of São Paulo\n\n\n== References ==",

It could be issued to persons who had no unsetlled obligations before the Polish state, various Polish organizations and private persons. A \"leaflet consular passport\" (Polish: paszport konsularny blankietowy) was issued for Polish citizens temporarily abroad to enable their return to Poland in the case they could not use their national passport (e.g., because the latter was damaged or lost) and to Polish citizens deported from the abroad. Its validity was for the time required for return, but no longer than for six months.\nIn addition to consulates, consular passports could be issued by some other Polish state establishments of international representation, such as diplomatic missions.\n\n\n== References ==",

A player who qualifies as a qualifier, but later becomes a seed due to the withdrawal of one or more other players shall be credited with their prize money on all Orders of Merit regardless of how far they progress in the event.\n\n\n== Qualification and format ==\nA massive overhaul in the qualification for the 2024 European Tour events was announced on 7 January.\nFor the first time, both the PDC Order of Merit and the PDC ProTour Order of Merit rankings were used to determine 32 of the 48 entrants for the event.\nThe top 16 on the PDC Order of Merit qualified, along with the highest 16 ranked players on the PDC ProTour Order of Merit (after the PDC Order of Merit players were removed). From those 32 players, the 16 highest ranked players on the PDC ProTour Order of Merit were seeded for the event.\nThe seedings were confirmed on 1 May.\nThe remaining 16 places went to players from four qualifying events – 10 from the Tour Card Holder Qualifier (to be held on 8 May), four from the Host Nation Qualifier (to be held on 23 May), one from the Nordic & Baltic Associate Nation Qualifier (held on the 6 April) and one from the East European Associate Member Qualifier (held on the 7 April).\nThe following players will take part in the tournament:\n\n\n== Draw ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Izvorska reka (Bulgarian: Изворска река) is a 35 km long river in eastern Bulgaria that flows into Lake Burgas, which drains into the Black Sea. \nThe river takes its source under the name Selska reka at an altitude of 386 m in the Bosna Ridge in the northern part of the Strandzha mountain range, some 3.5 km southwest of the village of Indzhe Voivoda. It flows in direction north-northeast in a deep valley, which unlike most others in Strantdzha is not densely forested. Near the village of Krushevets its valley widens and then narrows and deepens again until finally widening downstream from the village of Izvor. The Izvorska reka flows into Lake Mandrensko some 1.8 km southwest of the village of Tvarditsa. The lake itself drains into the Gulf of Burgas in the Black Sea. \nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 109 km2. It borders the basins of the Fakiyska reka to the west, the Veleka to the south, and the Ropotamo to the west, all of them flowing into the Black Sea. The river has predominantly rain feed with high water in February–March and low water in August–September.\nThe Izvorska reka flows entirely in Burgas Province. There are six villages along its course, Indzhe Voivoda, Krushevets and Izvor, all of them in Sozopol Municipality. Its waters are utilised for irrigation. \n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "Strontium carbide (also more precisely known as strontium acetylide or strontium dicarbide) is a salt with chemical formula SrC2.  It was first synthesized by Moissan in 1894.  \nStrontium carbide can be formed in an electric arc furnace from strontium carbonate and a reductant, such as a reducing sugar or magnesium metal.  Alternatively, carbothermal reduction of strontium oxide with graphite begins around 150 °C and is catalyzed by calcium oxide.  Classical organic chemistry syntheses include transmetallation from mercury acetylide or an acid-base reaction between dibenzylstrontium and acetylene, although these techniques often produce complexes with the solvent.  Direct formation from the elements has a notional enthalpy of -20 kcal/mol.  \nNevertheless, strontium carbide may be only metastable when encapsulated in a fullerene.   It slowly hydrolyzes in air to acetylene.  \nThe material is polymorphic, forming a monoclinic crystal structure akin to calcium carbide II and a black tetragonal phase.  Heated to 370 °C, it reversibly converts to a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice.  Yttrium carbide retains the fcc lattice down to room temperature; the difference is a 3eg orbital that strontium lacks the electrons to fill.  Cyanamide impurities stabilize one other strontium carbide polymorph, just as they do for calcium carbide.  The stabilized calcium carbide polymorph is triclinic, and the strontium carbide polymorph is believed to be so as well.  \nAt roughly 1800 °C, strontium carbide melts.  It forms a solid solution with europium carbide, as Eu2+ has an almost identical ionic radius to Sr2+.  \nStrontium carbide is a chemical intermediate in an archaic carbon-14 dating technique: burning the material to be dated releases carbon dioxide, trapped as strontium carbonate.  Magnesium then reduces the carbonate to strontium carbide and hydrolysis releases acetylene.  The radioactive decay of the acetylene can then be observed directly or heating to 600 °C polymerizes the acetylene to benzene for a liquid scintillator. \nSolid state metathesis of strontium carbide and a (complex) metal oxide gives the corresponding metal carbide and strontium oxide.  The latter washes away easily in pure water.  \n\n\n== References ==",

As part of the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses, demonstrators requested for the university to divest from “the state of Israel, Israeli companies, and any weapons or surveillance manufacturing.”\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n=== May 1 ===\nOn May 1, the University of Oregon president, Karl Scholz, made a statement regarding the encampment. While explicitly supporting the student right to protest and exchange ideas, he criticized protester demands for divestment as having a \"performative aspect.\" Despite this, 74 university faculty and staff have signed an open letter in support of the encampment.\n\n\n=== May 5–6 ===\nBy May 5, the encampment had grown to nearly 150 tents. On the afternoon of May 6, encampment spokespersons alleged that they had received a letter from university administrators threatening to revoke academic amnesty from protesters should the camp remain the following day at noon. This came amidst complaints from some Jewish students among whom the encampment had caused discomfort. In response to this, one protester stated that the demonstration calls for formal protection for Jewish students, and that Jewish student-represented organizations such as Jewish Voice for Peace have helped in setting up the encampment.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n2024 Portland State University pro-Palestinian campus occupation\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Latin phrase Epicuri de grege porcum (literally, \"A pig from the herd of Epicurus\") was a phrase first used by the Roman poet Horace. The phrase appears in an epistle to Albius Tibullus, giving advice to the moody fellow poet:\n\nEpicurus was an Ancient Greek philosopher who taught that pleasure was the natural aim of man (as well as of all living things). From the beginning, Epicureans were keen to extol man's pleasure above that of the beasts. For Epicurus, man alone had the pleasures of friendship and philosophy; indeed, philosophy gave man the important ability to drive out empty or unnatural desires. The Epicurean philosopher Lucretius, in his De rerum natura, compared primitive men to \"hairy boars\" in their unhappiness. Only humans had the ability to cooperate and form societies which fostered pleasure. Philodemus forcefully rebutted arguments that the animals, since they did not know of the Gods, were happier than humans (who fretted constantly of the Gods' existence). Animals, he alleged, had such anxieties but lacked the capacity of reason and therefore could not dispel them (as the Epicureans had succeeded at doing).\nNonetheless, the Epicurean philosophy lent itself to uncharitable comparisons to the basest of animals. Epicurus's contemporary Timon of Phlius labelled him the \"most piggish, most doggish\" philosopher. A silver cup of 30 AD uncovered at Boscoreale depicts Epicurus discoursing on pleasure as a greedy pig jumps up to steal food from the cooking pot. Plutarch's humorous dialogue Gryllus has Odysseus debate with one of his men whom Circe has turned into a pig. The pig convinces him that, immune to unnatural desires and free from false beliefs, his new species's virtue and happiness is much greater than that of Odysseus's.\nSome Epicureans, like Horace, embraced this symbol. The pig was already a symbol of ataraxia (imperturbability) for the followers of Pyrrho, so did not have solely negative connotations. The Villa of the Papyri, the centre of a circle of Epicureans, featured a large bronze statue of a pig on its hind legs.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Rusokastrenska reka (Bulgarian: Русокастренска река) is a 65 km long river in eastern Bulgaria that flows into Lake Burgas, which drains into the Black Sea. In 1332 near the river's left banks close to the fortress of Rusokastro the Bulgarian emperor Ivan Alexander defeated the Byzantine army under emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos in the battle of Rusokastro.\nThe river takes its source from a spring on the southern slopes of the Hisar Heights at an altitude of 335 m, some 2.4 km southeast of the town of Karnobat. It flows in southeastern direction through the Burgas Plain in a wide valley covered with farmlands. At the village of Zhelyazovo it bends north to bypass the isolated height of Rusen Kamal (108 m), takes its largest tributary the Hadzhilarska reka, and continues southeast. The Rusokastrenska reka flows into Lake Mandrensko near the village of Konstantinovo. The lake itself drains into the Gulf of Burgas in the Black Sea. \nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 525 km2. It borders the basins of the Chukarska reka to the northeast, the Sredetska reka to the south and southwest, both flowing into the Black Sea, and shares a boundary with the river Mochuritsa of the Tundzha basin to the northwest, part of the Maritsa basin that belongs to the Aegean Sea drainage.

Track announcers coined his driving style as the \"Patented Peek Charge\", as he would wait until the end of the race to make his move to victory.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nHarry Peek began racing in the support division at Lebanon Valley Speedway in 1966.  He moved to late model division at Fonda Speedway in 1968, capturing 23 feature wins in a little over three years and a division championship in 1969.\nThe following year, Peek stepped up to the modified division, winning his first feature. He went on to win the Fonda track championships in 1972, 1973, 1974, and 1976.  Peek also found success at the Albany-Saratoga Speedway in Malta NY, Devil's Bowl Speedway in West Haven VT, Rolling Wheels Raceway in Elbridge NY, and the Weedsport Speedway NY.\nHarry Peek was inducted into the New York State Stock Car Association Hall of Fame in 1998 and the Northeast Dirt Modified Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Peter Moraw (31 August 1935 – 8 April 2013) was a German historian.\nMoraw taught as Professor of Medieval History, German Regional History, and Economic and Social History at the University of Giessen for three decades until his retirement in 2003. His work in the second half of the 20th century considerably influenced German Late Middle Ages research. He is most renowned for his contributions to integrating theory-oriented social sciences and prosopography into medieval research, the turn towards court research oriented towards structural history, and a university history understood as social history. His late medieval volume, From an Open Constitution to a Designed Consolidation of the Propylaea, History of Germany, became a standard work in medieval studies.\n\n\n== Life ==\nPeter Moraw was born on 31 August 1935 in the industrial city of Moravská Ostrava in Czechoslovakia. Following the conclusion of the Second World War, he was compelled to flee his native Czechoslovakia and seek refuge with his parents in Heidelberg. He graduated from high school there in 1955. Like his father, he pursued a degree in history, German, and Latin at the Heidelberg University from 1955 to 1960, to become a teacher. He completed the state examination for teaching at grammar schools in 1960. From 1961 to 1971, he served as a research assistant at the Institute for Franconian-Palatinate History and Regional Studies at the University of Heidelberg. As outlined in a thesis by Bernd Schneidmüller, Moraw's Moravian homeland and his academic socialization in Heidelberg were pivotal in shaping his research interests in the Late Middle Ages. In Heidelberg, Moraw was influenced by Reinhart Koselleck, who opened up the perspective to cross-epochal questions and was open to interdisciplinary methods. Moraw named Werner Conze, Erich Maschke, Ahasver von Brandt , and Hermann Heimpel as the historians who influenced him. He received his doctorate under Fritz Ernst in 1961 at the age of 26 with a thesis on the St. Philipp Abbey in Zell in the Palatinate. Moraw had chosen this small and relatively insignificant abbey because its documents were in the Heidelberg University Archives and therefore on the floor below his study. By the standards of the time, the dissertation had a \"classical-land-historical approach\". His doctoral supervisor had already passed away by the time his dissertation was published. Moraw reoriented his methodological approach, expanding beyond conceptual history to encompass the history of individuals. He undertook a detailed study of Helmut Berve's Alexanderreich and the early works of the Tellenbach school. These works served as a catalyst for his development of a more nuanced understanding of pre-modern conditions, based on a prosopographical approach.\nIn the ten years between his dissertation and his habilitation, he was a habilitation fellow of the German Research Foundation (DFG), engaged for the first time with university history, translated central sources on the life and canonization of Hedwig of Silesia, and presented a map of the monasteries and convents with detailed explanations for the Palatinate Atlas of the Palatinate Society for the Advancement of Science. He completed his habilitation in medieval and modern history at the University of Heidelberg in 1971. His habilitation thesis, König, Reich und Territorium im späten Mittelalter (King, Empire and Territory in the Late Middle Ages), which was almost 1,000 typewritten pages long (818 pages of text and 172 pages of notes and bibliography), remained unpublished. Nevertheless, this work provided sufficient material for several pioneering studies in which he examined various aspects, including the councils and the chancellery of King Rupert of the Palatinate or the court, the council and the chancellery of Charles IV. He delivered his habilitation lecture on 17 July 1971, at the University of Heidelberg on the subject of Hessian collegiate churches in the Middle Ages. In 1971, Moraw assumed a position as a deputy professor of medieval history at the Technical University of Darmstadt.\nIn 1972, he was appointed Professor of General History with a focus on the auxiliary historical sciences at the Bielefeld University, where the history department was dedicated to the theoretical foundations of its own discipline. From the summer semester of 1973, Moraw succeeded František Graus as Professor of Medieval History and German Regional History with a particular emphasis on economic and social history at the University of Giessen. From 1973 to 1980, he collaborated closely with Volker Press, an early modern scholar, at the University of Giessen. At the beginning of the 1980s, Moraw, Press, and the sociologist Helge Pross offered courses at the University of Giessen, a notable occurrence at the time.\nHe declined appointments to Düsseldorf, Trier (1976) and Tübingen (1981). From 1979 to 1980 and again from 1997 to 1998, he served as Dean of the Department of History. From 1980 to 1981 and again from 1998 to 1999, he held the office of Vice Dean. In 1992, he co-founded and served as the inaugural speaker for the DFG Research Training Group on Medieval and Modern Statehood in Giessen. In 1997, he became a co-founder and project leader for the DFG's Collaborative Research Center on Cultures of Memory at the University of Giessen. He was awarded emeritus status there in the summer semester of 2003. On 23 July 2003, Moraw delivered his valedictory address on the empire in medieval Europe.\nMoraw had been married since 1964. The marriage produced two daughters, including the classical archaeologist Susanne Moraw. His wife died in 1997 and due to a long illness, he was no longer able to take part in academic discourse in the last few years before his death on 8 April 2013.\n\n\n== Main research areas ==\n\nMoraw's research encompassed the constitutional history of the German late Middle Ages, the social history of the Middle Ages, the German regional history of the Middle Ages and modern times, as well as the history of universities and education in the Middle Ages and modern times. He has published nine independent publications and more than 200 essays, handbook articles, and encyclopedia contributions on these topics. Moraw's contributions to the field of German late medieval studies have significantly advanced our understanding of this historically understudied period. From 1987 onwards, Moraw was engaged in the Lexikon des Mittelalters as a co-editor and expert advisor, for which he authored numerous articles on topics including Germany in the Late Middle Ages, Charles IV and the Imperial Diet, and others.\n\n\n=== Works on the Late Middle Ages ===\n\n\n=== Development of new approaches since the 1970s ===\nMoraw and Volker Press identified a significant deficiency in historical scholarship: the lack of integration between imperial and regional history. In 1977, Moraw proposed a method for addressing this issue: the development of a constitutional-historical territorial grammar. This approach involved identifying and analyzing the recurring situations, constellations, and processes that shape the evolution of political territories. Concerning the \"personal relationships,\" the dynasty, the relationship between the king and the realm on the one hand and the territories on the other, as well as the territorial constitution, there were four aspects under which a \"territorial grammar\" could be written in the sense of \"historical rule or reference systems.\" Moraw and Press regarded the separate consideration of royal actions and territorial developments as a significant obstacle to grasping the complexity of political processes. Both historians sought to expand the scope of constitutional and political history to encompass social history, thereby replacing the institutional model of the Old Kingdom and its institutions as understood through the lens of older constitutional history with a more nuanced understanding of the late medieval and early modern kingdom. Press and Moraw developed a program for the \"structural analysis of the imperial body.\" Their starting point was that the king and emperor constituted the central legitimizing point of reference in the empire. They argued for placing the \"royal/imperial court as the starting and finishing point of reciprocal interactions\" at the center of their considerations and wanted a \"draft of a political-structural map of the empire from the king.\" The objective was to combine social and constitutional history by analyzing the institutions of rule (Imperial Diet, Imperial Judiciary, Imperial Church, and Imperial Circles) and their supporters (political leadership groups). The \"dualism of the power of kingship [...] and territories\" was to be examined in more detail. The core idea of the project was \"a constitutional and socio-historical synthesis with the ultimate, probably still distant goal of a unified overall view of the Holy Roman Empire.\"\nMoraw turned away from the study of classical constitutional and administrative history because he believed that institutions were still subordinate to individuals and that offices were shaped by individuals. He also rejected the term \"civil servants\" and instead referred to those who brought money and power with them into an employment relationship as \"co-entrepreneurs.\" A person who had ties to more than one employer was a \"professional politician.\" Only by researching personal relationships and associations is it possible to make statements about institutions.\n\n\n==== From \"open constitution\" to \"designed densification\" ====\nIn 1989, Moraw published a new, comprehensive account of German history from the 13th to 15th centuries in the \"Propylaea History of Germany\" series. Since Hermann Heimpel's seminal work, Germany in the Later Middle Ages, which first appeared in 1938 and then again in a new edition in 1957, no single historian had addressed the period as a whole for decades. Moraw described the evolution of the empire from an \"open constitution\" to a \"designed consolidation.\" He conceptualized the \"open constitution\" as the \"legacy of the defeat of the Hohenstaufen,\" whereby the institutionalized moment was constrained to a minimum, a select few participated in the power play of the entire empire, and the scope of new challenges to the members of the empire was limited. Moraw posited that the \"designed consolidation\" was the consequence of the emergence of new challenges at the end of the Middle Ages. These challenges included the rise and consolidation of the Habsburg dynasty and the establishment of the institutionalized dualism of the imperial estates, which culminated in the Imperial Diet. The great dynasty and the estates were now dependent on each other.\n\n\n==== Relationship between central and local powers ====\nMoraw published numerous studies on the spatial and power structure of the empire, especially for the time of Charles IV. In 1982, he called for \"research into the mechanisms and scope of political rule\" in the late medieval empire in order to gain a better understanding. In an essay published in 1987, he wondered \"how a great empire could survive when it was administered with so few resources and by so few people. To answer this question, \"the mechanical-technical history of administration must be extended to include the methods of historical personal research. At the end of the Middle Ages, the empire was less a \"state in the abstract sense of an institutional state\" than a polycentric structure of regions with different levels of development and proximity (or distance) to the king. According to Moraw, the empire was divided into three main zones: the hereditary land, landscapes close to the king, and the \"vast remainder,\" which had extremely little to contribute to the royal court. In a finer subdivision, based on the concrete example of two landscapes (Hesse, Franconia), he proceeded from the idea of a \"punctual royal court\" from which \"lines of power\" emanated and led to it. He was able to divide the empire into six zones or areas with the territories of the reigning king, the territories of the rival dynasties and the electors, the landscapes close to the king, the landscapes open to the king, and the landscapes distant from the king. In contrast to the work of Eckhard Müller-Mertens, the study of the rulers' itineraries was of secondary importance for Moraw. With regard to Franconia, Moraw defined \"proximity to the king\" in terms of persons such as \"royal servants\" and \"royal partners\". In addition to the zonal model, he made other observations about the structure of the empire. He divided the northern Alpine empire, especially in the second half of the 14th century, into fourteen \"largely self-sufficient\" regions.\nMoraw's point of departure in examining the history of territories and regions was the perspective of kingship. In several essays, he showed that late medieval kingship could not encompass all of the empire's landscapes equally. Moraw divided the empire into different zones with landscapes \"close to the king\" and \"distant from the king. By \"close to the king\" Moraw meant \"Franconia with Nuremberg as its capital, the Middle Rhine-Upper Main region with Frankfurt, parts of Swabia temporarily centered in Augsburg, and, to a lesser extent, the Middle Elbe-Saale region. For him, the \"Upper Rhine and, to a lesser extent, the Lower Rhine\" were \"open to the king. He considered the \"territories of the rival great dynasties and the non-royal electors\" to be \"politically distant from the king. The northern third of the empire and the Romanesque west and southwest were geographically distant from the king.\nIn his 1987 essay \"On Developmental Differences and Developmental Equalization in the German and European Middle Ages,\" Moraw advocated a developmental model of a west–east and south–north cultural divide. According to Moraw, the interface ran through the medieval empire. Germania Slavica, which was largely located on the Baltic Sea, was particularly disadvantaged. Only at the end of the Middle Ages was a certain balance achieved. In this essay he also developed a model for understanding the different stages of development in Europe. The criteria were the influences of Roman antiquity, which had a decisive impact on southern and western Europe (\"older Europe\"), while in areas such as central, northern, and eastern Europe (\"younger Europe\") they were absent or at best had only sparse effects. The concept was usually used as a pair of terms to describe something along the lines of Moraw. The model has also been used to try to explain differences between European universities.\nMoraw argued for a greater inclusion of dynastic thought in the study of late medieval constitutional and social history. He characterized dynastic action as an essential part of political action. In a statement formulated in 1983, Moraw made clear the importance of the dynasty for the political-social order: \"The king also acted first according to dynastic considerations and only then thought about his territories and his empire.\" Moraw divided the individual dynasties into \"great dynasties,\" \"secondary powers,\" \"middle powers,\" and principalities with little or no political leeway. This classification was criticized by Karl-Heinz Spiess because of the difficulty of measuring the \"capacity to act\" factor. Moraw sympathized with great dynasties and centralizing tendencies. For him, the great dynasties were the \"decisive forces in German history. In contrast, the period from the interregnum to the beginning of the second quarter of the fourteenth century was for him a phase of \"relative stagnation in constitutional development. For Moraw, the late medieval rulers of this period, from Rudolf of Habsburg to Henry VII, were \"small kings\" by European standards. \"For they did not belong to a powerful dynasty with an old royal tradition, their position of power in the empire was modest, and their means of rule [...] were relatively underdeveloped and hardly 'modern.' They could do little or nothing to change the existing political conditions on a large scale. He characterized Sigismund's reign as one of \"exertion and excessive demands. For Moraw, the princes were mostly underpowered and had little or no room for maneuver within the late medieval imperial structure.\nMoraw held the person and \"strong reign\" of Charles IV in high esteem. For him, Charles IV was the \"greatest ruler of the German late Middle Ages\" and his reign a \"high point of late medieval royal power. His chancellery was also a high point in the administrative history of the late medieval empire.\n\n\n==== Court and Imperial Diet research ====\nMoraw used prosopography in his research to understand the social rules of clientelism and patronage, kinship and friendship in late medieval chancelleries and courts. In his view, kingship should be interpreted in terms of its individuals and their relationships rather than its institutions. In a personal history of the court of the Roman-German kings from Rudolf of Habsburg to Frederick III, Moraw identified 230 learned jurists.\nFriedrich Battenberg's dissertation, published in 1974, led to a research discourse with Moraw on the degree of institutionalization of the court and its dependence on the king, first in personal letters and then in research articles. In his study of the court chancellery, Battenberg argued that the court had become largely independent of the king by 1430 at the latest, due to a high degree of professionalization. Moraw considered the idea that part of the court organization had pursued an independent policy against the interests of the sovereign to be too modern and therefore anachronistic.\nFrom the 1980s, research on the Imperial Diet became a focus of Moraw's academic work. In his essay on the Origins of the Imperial Diet, published in 1980, he historicized the History of Imperial Assemblies. These took on an institutional form only in the last third of the 15th century. According to Moraw, it is possible to speak of an imperial diet from the 70s or 80s of the 15th century at the earliest. The term itself does not appear in sources before 1495. Moraw called for a critical examination of the compiled source material for the edition of the imperial dietary records of the 15th century (the so-called Older Series). He argued that the Great Edition \"created the Imperial Diet in the first place, or at least consolidated it. Moraw thus attempted to equalize the phenomenon of the \"Reichstag\" and to create an awareness that the edition of the Imperial Diet Records was a scholarly product. Some of the sessions presented as Reichstag in the edition were later downgraded by scholars.\nMoraw made fundamental contributions to the study of the German royal court in the late Middle Ages. His merit lies in the fact that he repeatedly pointed out that medieval imperial assemblies are not to be equated with modern representative bodies and that the Imperial Diet at the end of the 15th century was still a court day (curia), i.e. a meeting of the king with his faithful, which differed from the daily court of the ruler in its festive and public character. The double conference he organized for the Constance Working Group in 1992/93, German Royal Court, Court Diet and Imperial Diet in the Late Middle Ages (12th-15th centuries), was \"primarily concerned with constitutional history and then also with social history, and only to a much lesser extent with literary and cultural history. The focus of interest was on questions of \"the functional network of effects, the processes of the modernization of rule, the significance of the legal legitimation potential and the integrative power of the court and the imperial diet in the cultural-political sense. Moraw contributed a paper on the court of Charles IV. For Moraw, in contrast to older scholarship, the court was no longer the central political authority, but rather the ruler's court mutated into the \"most important emanation of the medieval sovereign in our cultural sphere and at the same time his decisive sphere of life and action, without which he could not exist\"; the court was the \"most essential core area of extended public existence.\n\n\n=== University history ===\nMoraw was considered an expert in the history of the university, to which he devoted more than five decades. His dissertation already touched on the history of the university. After the Reformation, the Palatine monastery of St. Philipp zu Zell had contributed to the financial endowment of Heidelberg University. His first independent publication on university history was published in 1961 on the Heidelberg Faculty of Philosophy, and his last publication was a final commentary on the conference of the Society for the History of Universities and Science, published in 2007. As an academic teacher, he supervised nine doctoral dissertations and two postdoctoral theses on university history.\nUntil the 1940s, research had attempted to describe and depict the functioning of individual universities on the basis of legal sources. In contrast to earlier scholarship, Moraw focused on individuals rather than institutions. By paying more attention to socio-historical aspects, he gained new insights into the late medieval and early modern university. On the occasion of the 575th anniversary of the University of Heidelberg, he and Theodor Karst published an article on the relationship between the University of Heidelberg and Neustadt an der Haardt. In this study, Moraw was the first to reveal a social and personal network between an educational institution and a town community. The study was based on a list of Neustadt students and thus on a serial source. This type of source was hardly considered by historians at the time.\nIn an essay published in the Giessen University Papers in 1975, he argued for greater consideration of social history in university history research. His approach was based on personal and social history data. A sufficiently large and well-defined group of people is studied in their respective political, social, and cultural contexts. He was an early adopter of the social science approaches to university history of Lawrence Stone, Jacques Le Goff, and Jacques Verger, who had considered the interrelationships between society, university, and education earlier than German-speaking scholars. For Moraw, universities were \"nodes of personal relations.\nThe 375th anniversary of the University of Giessen in 1982 provided the impetus for a more intensive and continuous study of the university's history. His Kleine Geschichte der Universität Gießen (1607-1982), first published in 1982 and in a second edition in 1990, is still the only comprehensive account of Giessen's university history. In this work he also paid more attention to social history. For this monograph, he was awarded the Justus Liebig University Prize in 1983 for his work on the history of the University of Giessen. Moraw always understood the history of universities in a cross-epochal way. In 1982 he distinguished three dimensions of university history research (institutional, scientific, and environmental). In an essay published in 1983, he argued that the university should be \"emphatically placed in its environment\" and that a \"social history of the university\" should be developed. He exemplified this in the late Middle Ages by examining the relationship between the University of Heidelberg and the court of the Count Palatine and the social relationship between the university and the city of Heidelberg.\nMoraw was one of the foremost experts on the history of Charles University in Prague, to which he devoted a large number of works. In 1986, he published an account of the main features of the history of Prague University from its foundation in 1347/48 to 1417/19 with a focus on constitutional and social history. He studied the Prague Faculty of Law from the perspective of constitutional and social history. He has also studied other German and Central European universities. Together with Rainer Christoph Schwinges he initiated the Repertorium Academicum Germanicum. From 2001 to 2019, this research project will record 64,000 scholars of the Old Kingdom between 1250 and 1550 at the two workplaces in Giessen and Bern, with as complete a curriculum vitae as possible. The project aims to combine institutional history (universities and administrations) with social and cultural history (origins, studies, social networks) and with the history of science (learning content and knowledge transfer) in order to obtain as accurate a picture as possible of scholars in pre-modern society.\n\n\n=== Collegiate churches ===\nHis dissertation on St. Philipp Abbey in Zell was his first contribution to collegiate churches. In five sections he dealt with the foundation, the internal conditions, the external conditions, the ownership and the end of the abbey. The work was well received by the experts. In 1964 and 1965, two essays were published in the Archive for Middle Rhine Church History as direct offshoots of his dissertation. One essay, on 28 printed pages, dealt with the difficult situation of the small collegiate monastery of St. Fabian in Hornbach. The other essay on patronage research was inspired by the naming of several patrons for the monastery of St. Philipp in Zell. Moraw investigated the problem of multiple patrocinia and was able to show that when different patrons were named, it could be assumed that there were multiple patrocinia and not changes of patrocinia. Subsequently, he continued the research focus established in his dissertation by developing comparative research approaches and critical reviews, rather than through further monastic monographs. As an academic teacher, he only supervised one monograph as a dissertation.\nIn 1977 and 1980, Moraw published programmatic essays on the Hessian and German collegiate churches in typological, chronological, and geographical terms. In his attempt at a typology of the German collegiate church in the Middle Ages, he summarized the numerous studies on individual collegiate churches. According to Moraw, monasticism, episcopacy, and the secular structure of government were the three main forces that decisively determined the institution of the collegiate church. He also distinguished three types of collegiate foundations (monastic collegiate churches, episcopal collegiate foundations, and lay foundations). Moraw emphasized that \"the most important research goal\" is to study the collegiate church as a central \"place of encounter between church and world\" in its transformation from the 9th to the 16th century. However, a canonical or church-historical approach to the object of study could be largely dispensed with. Chronologically, Moraw distinguished three \"foundation periods\". The \"Carolingian-pre-Germanic period\" lasted from 816 to 900, with a break around 900 due to the general crisis. The \"early German-archaic\" period lasted from the middle of the 10th to the third quarter of the 11th century and was closely linked to the so-called Ottonian-Salian imperial church system. The \"Old European-territorial phase\" began in the 13th century and lasted until the Reformation. Moraw also showed that collegiate churches and their endowments could serve as a \"Leitfossil\" for \"the general level of socio-economic development\" in Germany and throughout Europe.\n\n\n=== Hessian state history ===\nMoraw's work on Hessian regional history was primarily intended to clarify overarching questions. He pursued regional history from the perspective of kingship. Here, too, the functioning of the Holy Roman Empire was the focus of his research. Moraw thus changed his perspective and looked from the kingdom to the territory rather than from the territory or region to the king. The focus was on political-social structures rather than on the population and its environment. He was only peripherally involved in areas of regional history such as settlement research, road research, or linguistic history.\nThe Landgraviate of Hesse was therefore of particular interest to Moraw for the development of his theoretical concepts. He integrated regional historical findings into an overarching model. In his essay on Hesse and German kingship, he argued that the landgraviate of Hesse was distant from the kings. However, his models were based more on the research of other historians than on his own source work. According to Christine Reinle, Moraw's works on the history of the country show a low density of sources. He also did not initiate any editions of regional history, but he supervised numerous works in the field of Hessian regional history. Moraw was instrumental in organizing the Hessian State Exhibition Hesse and Thuringia in 1992. He gave numerous lectures on topics of Hessian regional history for the Hessian Broadcasting Corporation, the Upper Hessian Historical Society, or at a celebration of the 750th anniversary of the separation of Hesse from Thuringia in connection with the 100th anniversary of the Commission for Hesse.\n\n\n== Scientific organization ==\n\n\n=== Journal for Historical Research ===\nFrom 1974 he was one of the co-editors of the then newly founded Journal of Historical Research. The journal's editorial board opted for a new model of periodization. The late Middle Ages were separated from traditional medieval studies and combined with the early modern period to form an \"Old European Era\" (roughly 12th to 18th or early 19th centuries), from which an \"Archaic Middle Ages\" (up to the 11th/12th centuries) and an \"Industrial Era\" (18th/19th centuries) were to be distinguished. Moraw was responsible for the Late Middle Ages and was in charge of this area for more than two decades. Already in the first volume, with his review of selected essays and lectures by Alfons Lhotsky, he established the journal's commitment to the late Middle Ages. Moraw also left his mark on the journal by including issues of personal history. This happened especially in the second volume, where he commented on personal research and German kingship and, together with Volker Press, presented the program of the new DFG research focus Problems of the Social and Constitutional History of the Holy Roman Empire in the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Period, 13th-18th Century. He made a special contribution to the development of the review section. His last reviews appeared in 1993 in volume 20 of the Journal of Historical Research.\n\n\n=== Residences Commission ===\nHans Patze had initiated the large-scale residences project at the Göttingen Academy of Sciences in the early 1980s. In a 1991 programmatic review of the first volume of the Residences Research series, Moraw criticized the Residences Commission's approach to topography and material culture, which had been shaped by Patze. Moraw called for the Residences program to focus on the question of what \"can be called the center of action or even the center of legitimation of the older polity, and on which all those strands that make up the late medieval 'state' constitution converge. It was not the residence, but dynasties and courts that were to be researched more intensively. In response to Moraw's criticism, the Residence Commission placed court research on an equal footing with residence research in 1991. Because of his critical opinion, his personal involvement in the Ansbach symposium on everyday life at court (1992), and the conference on the royal court at Reichenau that he organized, he was asked by the Residence Commission to play an active role and was elected a member in October 1992. He summarized the 1994 Potsdam symposium on ceremonial and space and the 1996 Sigmaringen symposium on courts and court orders. He improved the Heidelberg volume of Residence Research. He contributed the article on King Ruprecht of the Palatinate to the Handbook.\n\n\n=== Constance working group ===\nAfter attending his first conferences and giving three lectures on Reichenau, Moraw was co-opted into the Constance Working Group on Medieval History in 1983. After his election he participated regularly in the conferences with few exceptions. In the fall of 1992 and spring of 1993, he organized the double conference German Royal Court, Court Diet and Imperial Diet in the Late Middle Ages (12th-15th centuries) for the Constance Working Group. In 1994, he was elected as the successor of Harald Zimmermann. Under his chairmanship, the conferences became more open to young scholars. He also suggested that suggestions for conference topics could come from outside the working group and that academic trends should be taken up more quickly. As chairman of the working group, he organized a conference on the topic of spatial recording and spatial perception in the Late Middle Ages (12th to 15th centuries). He made the spatial turn, which had not yet been widely accepted as a research trend, at least in Germany, a fruitful topic for the working group at an early stage. Under his chairmanship, a new conference venue had to be found. The Hotel Kaiserpfalz in Reichenau-Mittelzell was the meeting place for medieval historians for about four decades until the lease was terminated. Together with Traute Endemann, Moraw was able to secure the Archdiocese of Freiburg's family resort on the southern shore of Lake Constance as a new conference venue. The first conference was held there in the spring of 1997.\nIn the autumn of 2001, together with Rudolf Schieffer, he organized the conference The German-speaking Medieval Studies in the 20th Century on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Constance Working Group for Medieval Studies. He contributed a paper on German and German-language medieval studies from 1945 to 1970. He cited the increased focus on the late Middle Ages as a major achievement of medieval studies. Moraw last attended a conference organized by Werner Maleczek in the spring of 2003. For health reasons, he was unable to attend conferences of the Reichenau Working Group during the last decade of his life.\n\n\n=== Regesta Imperii ===\nMoraw's motivation to work on the Regesta Imperii stemmed from his personal history questions and a departure from a purely kingship-oriented approach. These made him believe that a \"completion, revision, and continuation of the Regesta Imperii\" was objectively and methodologically necessary. Paul-Joachim Heinig sees Moraw's institutional merits in the establishment of the registers Friedrichs III. by establishing a cooperation project with Evamaria Engel at the Central Institute for History of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin in 1988 and securing the \"institutional future\" of this project after the end of the GDR \"within the framework of the academy landscape\" in the newly founded Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW). As a full member of the BBAW, he was also responsible for this department and was elected a member of the German Registers Commission as a delegate of the BBAW in 1996. He supported a \"coordinated new edition of the Regesta Imperii of Charles IV\". In the medium term, he also advocated the linking of all Regesta Imperii files.\n\n\n== Awards and memberships ==\nMoraw received numerous scientific awards and memberships for his research. Moraw became a member of many influential scholarly organizations. He was a corresponding member of the Palatinate Society for the Promotion of Science (1972), a member of the Hessian Historical Commission (1973), a corresponding member of the Commission for Historical Regional Studies in Baden-Württemberg (1979), a member of the Association for Constitutional History (1981) and its vice-chairman from 1989 to 1997, a member of the Collegium Carolinum Munich (1984), and a member of the Medieval Study Group of the Herzog August Library, full member of the Historical Commission of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (1987), full member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences (1996), member of the Commission for Research into the Culture of the Late Middle Ages of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, member of the Historical Commission for Silesia (1996), corresponding member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences (1997).\nSince 1995 he has been a member of the Commission for the Editing of the Regesta Imperii at the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz. Moraw was also a member of the Constance Working Group for Medieval History from 1983 and its chairman from 1994 to 1998. From 1986 to 1994 he was a reviewer for the German Research Foundation (DFG). The Sudeten German Academy of Sciences and Arts elected him a full member of the humanities class in 1980. In 1993 Moraw became a member of the Academia Europaea. In 1998, the University of Prague awarded him the Medal of Honor on the occasion of its 650th anniversary. In the same year, Moraw became a member of the Central Directorate of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica and remained a member until 2006. In 1999 he received an honorary doctorate from the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt. The Upper Hessian Historical Society made him an honorary member in 2007.\n\n\n== Scientific repercussions ==\nIn the field of medieval studies, the German history of the Late Middle Ages was previously regarded as an era characterized by the collapse of statehood at the imperial level. However, the constitutional and social history research of Peter Moraw and Ernst Schubert led to a shift in interest and thus a reassessment. Moraw's students produced major studies on Sigmund's political system, the court of Frederick III, and university visitors in the late medieval empire for further research into the Late Middle Ages. This new interest in the Late Middle Ages was also accompanied by a shift in perspective, moving away from the traditional image of decline. Instead, the historical development of the Late Middle Ages is now understood as a process of progress and \"modernizing condensation.\" Moraw had described the \"densification\" of the late Middle Ages primarily in institutional terms at the Royal Court, Court Diet, and Imperial Diet. More recent studies have expanded upon this term, applying it to princely practices of celebrating festivals, waging wars, or courtly dress practices.\nIn terms of personal history, Moraw's suggestions have been \"most successfully\" implemented in the collegiate church research of Gerhard Fouquet for the Speyer cathedral chapter and the collegiate monastery of St. Michael in Pforzheim. In his two-volume work on the Speyer cathedral chapter in the late Middle Ages, published in 1987, Fouquet wants to investigate \"the effective social and political network of relationships in Speyer\" and \"ask about its continuities and discontinuities. The question is \"about the fields of reference of the corporations supporting the individual imperial churches (cathedral and collegiate chapters), about their social parent groups, about the influence of territorial constellations, possibly of educational institutions, and about the effect of such structures on the election of bishops and prelates. Oliver Auge continued Moraw's approach in his dissertation. Moraw's suggestions had an influence far beyond the field of collegiate studies. In contrast to Moraw, who saw collegiate churches primarily as \"places where the church and the world met,\" Guy P. Marchal and Michael Borgolte emphasized the importance of the internal development of the abbeys. According to Borgolte, Moraw's view needs to be complemented by \"a history that emphasizes the self-image and religious tasks of the canons\". In contrast to Moraw, Marchal did not see the collegiate chapters as externally determined, but as the \"entrepreneurial institution par excellence\".\nThe model of \"close to the king,\" \"distant from the king,\" and \"open to the king\" became the dominant doctrine for describing the political structure of the late medieval empire. It has also been applied to the early modern period. Paul-Joachim Heinig has modified the thesis of the distance of the landgraves of Hesse from the king for the time of Landgrave Ludwig I. A further study has shown that Moraw's model cannot be sufficiently applied to political practice for the period around 1470, since a person could be \"close to the king\" and then \"distant from the king\" again, depending on the situation. Moraw's idea of a west–east and south–north cultural divide in the empire and Europe is widely accepted in research. Oliver Auge has modified this view for the Baltic region on the basis of early urban centers, the monastic system, and the Hanseatic trade.\nMoraw's comments on the \"smallness\" of late medieval German kings, especially in the case of Rupert of the Palatinate, continue to influence research to this day. Heinz Thomas challenged the characterization of Rudolph of Habsburg as a \"small king\". Oliver Auge focused his research on the \"minor\" princes, who have received little attention in research, and, in the case of Ruprecht of the Palatinate, on a \"minor\" king. He was able to show that \"minor\" princes could also be important in the history of the Holy Roman Empire.\nMoraw's work From Open Constitutions to Designed Compacts: The Empire in the Late Middle Ages 1250-1490 is considered by experts to be one of the best accounts of the period. Moraw's thesis of the consolidation of the late medieval German empire was confirmed by Oliver Auge (2009) in his study of the southern Baltic region from the mid-12th century to the early Reformation. According to a 2016 thesis by early modern historian Georg Schmidt, Moraw's concept of \"condensation\" was intended to show that \"German development was delayed compared to the West, but not fundamentally different\". According to Schmidt, the process of \"condensation\" ended with the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, \"a structure of complementary multi-level statehood.\nMoraw's socio-historical approach became established in historical scholarship. He also played a significant role in the renewed intensity of research on the court in recent decades. Moraw's understanding of the imperial court not as an institution but as a social structure has been further deepened by more recent scholarship. More recent scholarship on the Imperial Diet is essentially based on Moraw's constitutional and social-historical reflections on the origins of the late medieval Imperial Diet. This research has led to a departure from the anachronistic orientation towards modern parliamentary institutions and has opened up the prospect of a more appropriate description of the forms of action and communication. A number of studies, such as those by Gabriele Annas and Thomas Michael Martin, have examined the functioning of the imperial assemblies and attempted to locate their significance within the constitutional structure of the late medieval empire. One result of these research activities is the prosopographical analysis of the assemblies in the 14th and 15th centuries. In his 1993 study of the period from 1314 to 1410, Thomas Martin emphasized the variety of conference types and, in addition to court days, spoke of \"council days\" as days without a king and with the participation of the royal family.\nIn university and academic history, socio-historical research has received increased attention in recent decades. The works of Rainer Christoph Schwinges, Sylvia Paletschek, and Marian Füssel have demonstrated that the university functions as a site of social relations. The \"cultural-historical dimension\", i.e. the representation of universities and scholars through symbols, rituals, and public acts, is considered a fourth dimension in contemporary university historiography. According to Matthias Asche, Peter Moraw had already \"mentally prepared\" this dimension in the 1970s and 1980s. In 2008, 18 of his works on university history published since 1982 were published in a single volume.\nIn January 2014, the conference State and Perspectives of the Social and Constitutional History of the Roman and German Empire: Peter Moraw's Impact on the German Mediaeval Studies took place in Gießen at Moraw's memorial. The conference papers were edited by Christine Reinle in 2016. Bernd Schneidmüller saw at the conference the insistence on social, structural, and constitutional history in the Journal of Historical Research as an obstacle to methodological innovation. The turn towards \"cultural-historical Renaissance research\" and later \"turns\" unfolded outside the Journal of Historical Research. Schneidmüller credited Johannes Kunisch and, above all, Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger, but not Peter Moraw, with the \"consistent opening\" of the journal \"to topics in cultural studies. The new periodization of the entire first editorial board of the Journal of Historical Research into an archaic Middle Ages, a long epoch of ancient Europe, and the modern industrial world did not prevail in historical scholarship. The epochal concept of Ancient Europe, still new in 1974, has long been controversial among historians. Only two of the 229 articles published in the Journal of Historical Research between 1974 and 2011 include the term in their titles.\n\n\n== Publications (selection) ==\nEssay collections\n\nCollected contributions to German and European university history.

        "content": "On 30 April 2024, a man crashed a van into a pedestrian and property in the suburban area of Hainault, London, and proceeded to randomly attack people with a sword. One victim, a 14-year-old boy named Daniel Anjorin, was killed, and four others were injured, including two police officers. A 36-year-old man was arrested at the scene after being struck by several Taser rounds and tackled to the ground.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nOn 30 April 2024, between 06:50 and 07:00, residents of Hainault reported hearing screaming and shouting in the street and police were called. Around this time, a man in a yellow hoodie had crashed a van into a home, also hitting a pedestrian, whereupon bystanders approached the vehicle under the assumption an accident had occurred. The attacker, who was injured in the crash, exited the van and asked a woman where he was before pulling a sword, described by witnesses as a samurai, or samurai-style sword,  from his trousers and proceeding to slash at the neck of the man he had hit with the vehicle while yelling he was going to kill him.\nAround fifteen minutes later, the attacker forced his way into a family home and attacked a 35-year-old man as he slept in his bed. The man's hand was seriously injured in the attack and he lost large amounts of blood. Relatives of the man credited him with protecting his family from the attacker.\nSubsequently, the attacker began to approach 14-year old Daniel Anjorin from behind as the boy walked to school. Residents attempted to warn Anjorin of the danger, but witnesses claimed that he had headphones on, and so likely could not hear them. The attacker slashed the boy's neck from behind and then stabbed him in the chest, fatally wounding him. Two police officers arrived at the scene and approached Anjorin to try and help him, but the attacker appeared from a bush, prompting the officers to chase him. At one point, the attacker jumped out and slashed one of the officers as she lay on the ground and wounded the hand of the other officer.\nThroughout the spree, the attacker would climb over the gardens and garages of residents and roam the area, evading police. Witnesses claimed that the man was shouting and swearing, with video footage that captured the attacker shouting \"Is there anybody here who believes in God?\".\nAt around 7:22, further police officers were able to confront the attacker in a resident's driveway. Multiple Tasers were deployed against the attacker and he was subsequently tackled to the ground and arrested by a large number of police officers.\n\n\n== Victims ==\nOne victim was killed and four others were injured. A 33-year-old man was wounded after being struck by a van driven by the attacker and sustaining a blade wound to the neck; a 35-year-old man was attacked in a property, receiving laceration wounds to his arm; a 14-year-old boy was stabbed in the neck and chest with the sword and later died of his injuries in hospital; while confronting the suspect, a male police officer suffered a serious hand injury, which required surgery; and a female police officer who also confronted the suspect was seriously injured in the arm, which required surgery. The 14-year-old victim would later be widely identified as Daniel Anjorin.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nA 36-year-old man was arrested at the scene and later charged with murder, two counts of attempted murder, two counts of causing grievous bodily harm, aggravated burglary, and possession of a bladed article. Police were initially unable to question the suspect, who was sent to a hospital due to injuries allegedly sustained in the vehicle crash.\nThe Metropolitan Police said that the attack \"does not appear to be terror-related\" and they did not believe it was a \"targeted attack\". The motive for the sword attack is as yet unknown.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOn Sunday 5 May, around 300 people gathered at the car park of Hainault tube station to attend a vigil for Daniel Anjorin.\nDuring the Premier League match between Arsenal and Bournemouth at the Emirates Stadium, fans paid tribute to Daniel Anjorin, who was a supporter of Arsenal. In the 14th minute, supporters held up a banner with 'RIP Daniel' on it followed by a round of applause.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Julia H. Thayer (1847–1944) was an American poet and educator. Her productions, chiefly poetical, and hallowed by an abiding Christian element of thought and purpose, appeared in various papers and magazines. She wrote hymns, and was an authority on ancient Greek literature. Thayer served as president of the Chicago Female College, which was located in the Givins Beverly Castle, at Morgan Park, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJulia H. Thayer was born in Keeseville, New York, October 6, 1847, a village near Lake Champlain, where she lived the first ten years of her life. Her parents were Gilbert and Adeline Maria (Foote) Thayer. He had been instructor and principal of the Jacksonville Female Academy. Julia's siblings were Emma, Henry, Frank, and Addie\nAt the age of ten, Julia removed with her parents to the state of Illinois. At Morgan Park, she received her education at her father's school, the Chicago Female College.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThayer's brother was the first person to whom she confided that she wrote poetry. Reading some of her works to an unsuspecting grandmother, Thayer was horrified that the grandmother too often pronounced Thayer's writing as but \"silly trash,\" and rarely ascribed the praise of \"very good,\" or, \"I like that sentiment.\"\nShe first published her verses anonymously, but since 1870, the productions, chiefly poetical, appeared in various papers and periodicals under her own name. She received flattering inducements to write prose, but was most devoted to poetry. Her best works were religious poems and simple lyrics. Upon the third finger of her left hand is a plain gold ring, being the first piece of precious metal that she received for one of her poems. Thayer was not only a writer of lyrical poetry, but occasionally wrote prose, and was also a fine musician. \n\nAfter her father's death in 1892, Thayer became president of the nonsectarian Chicago Female College, located in the Givens Castle, which she owned.\nIn Chicago, Thayer also directed the Studio of General Culture and Literature Training. She was a member of the Illinois Woman's Press Association and the National League of American Pen Women.\nJulia H. Thayer died in Little Neck, New York, January 14, 1944.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n=== Hymns ===\nHis Greeting\nI Am Trusting in the Darkness\nI’ve Found Him\nMissing\nThere Is a Star That Gilds the Gloom\nThou Art Mine\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Coelostomidia zealandica (common name: great giant scale) is a scale insect endemic to New Zealand. The female is notably larger and very different in appearance from the small winged male.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nThis species was described in 1880 by William Maskell as Coelostoma zealandica from specimens collected in Otago on the bark of trees, and Canterbury \"buried in the ground and in the chinks of rocks, by the Sumner Road, Lyttelton, interspersed with another curious Coccid, feeding on Muehlenbeckia, a creeping plant growing thereabouts\". The new genus name Coelostoma was later found to be already in use, and Cockerell in 1900 proposed the new genus Coelostomidia to replace it. C. zealandica was redescribed by Morrison & Morrison in 1922, who also provided a full diagnosis of Coelostomidia. The type specimens are now housed in the New Zealand Arthropod Collection, Landcare Research, Auckland.\n\n\n== Excretion of honeydew ==\nC. zealandica feeds on sap and then excretes honeydew that is rich in sugar and provides a food source for birds, insects and lizards such as gecko. For example, the Duvaucel’s gecko feeds on honeydew from ngaio trees (Myoporum laetum) that host a high density of scale insects. Trees infested with a large number of scale insects can become coated with a sooty mould - a black fungus complex.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Coelostomidia zealandica at Wikimedia Commons\nCoelostomidia_zealandica discussed on RNZ Critter of the Week, 3 May 2024",

The station was in service for the La Habra–Fullerton–Yorba Linda Line. Rail service began in 1910 when tracks were laid through the town as far southeast as Stern. Passenger service beyond Yorba Linda was abandoned after August 1, 1930 and ended altogether after January 22, 1938.\nAfter closing as a railway depot, the building was a nursery, a lumber yard office, a real estate office, and a restaurant. The station building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 25, 1979. Polly's restaurant opened in the building in 1992.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke is a 1755 autobiography by English actress Charlotte Charke. Her autobiography sheds light on the experiences and difficulties she faced as a woman in the public eye, providing insight into the gender dynamics of 18th-century England and her own economic struggles. Originally published as a serial, Charke claims that the narrative is an attempt to reconcile with her father, who at the time of writing had disowned her. The book sold well and was republished several times.\nCharke was the daughter of the famous actor and playwright Colley Cibber and followed in his footsteps, spending much of her own life in the theater. Her narrative uses dramatic language and themes, allowing the sense of the theatre to be present in her autobiography as she takes on the role of different identities. However, much of her autobiography illustrates Charke's life off the stage, including her crossdressing. While she portrayed many breeches roles throughout her career in the theater, she often chose to cross dress under male identities in her daily life. Her autobiography documents the various occupations -sometimes male- that she assumed while crossdressing, her consistent economic deficiencies, multiple marriages, and the estrangement from her family and complications of her own.\nA notable aspect of the narrative style is its episodic format, which Charke claims to have chosen for specific entertainment and to gain public opinion on the episodes of her life that are implied to be the reason for Cibber's disownment of his daughter. Through modern perspectives, this narrative can be viewed as something akin to a tell-all. Charke’s autobiography was infamous in her time for her striking, somewhat chaotic prose as she jumped from subject to subject and from job to job. \nCharke's autobiographical narrative has maintained weight in many forms of modern literary criticism, most of which involve speculation around the consistent usage of crossdressing throughout her life. In the field of literature and gender studies, Charke's narrative has inspired work of to further understanding of English women's experiences in the 18th century. Patricia Meyer Spacks, Susan Paterson Glover, and Misty G. Anderson are just a few of the scholars who have delved into Charke's life and work, shedding light on the complexities of gender, performance, and identity in the 18th century.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke begins with a letter written by Charke to herself. The memoir covers Charke's childhood, which was largely comfortable. She also describes her fascination with pranks at a young age.\nAt the beginning of Charke's acting career at Drury Lane, her father's theatre, she meets her first husband, Richard Charke. They have a daughter, Catherine, but their romance is short-lived. Due to his infidelity and gambling addiction, they separate shortly after Catherine is born. Mr. Charke flees to Jamaica with his mistress and dies shortly thereafter. This leaves Charlotte as a single parent with accumulated debt, which even lands her in jail for some time.\nCharke begins to take breeches roles in her acting career as well as cross-dressing in her day-to-day life. Because of this, and reasons not stated in the memoir, Charke has a falling out with her father and is estranged from her family. She seeks his validation and forgiveness countless times and even mails him a letter in hopes of reconciliation. He sends back a blank sheet of paper, making his decision clear to her.\nCharke takes on the name Charles Brown and continues to take up space in male-dominated establishments. She also faces hardships at this time, as her debt and struggle to find acting roles, leads her to jump from job to job. She lands various jobs, being a valet, a sausage maker, a farmer, a waiter, a chef, and more.\nFor some time, she and a close friend, Mrs. Brown, pass as a married couple and raise her daughter together. Charke eventually settles back in London. She visits her daughter and disapproves of her son-in-law. She ends her memoir with a summary of the novel's purpose, to entertain and amuse her audience or readership but states that her cross-dressing concerns no one other than herself.\n\n\n== Historical context ==\n\n\n=== Politics and society ===\nDuring the early to mid eighteenth century, Great Britain was in a fairly prosperous period as it had various colonies in North America and India drawing in resources and wealth. However, this would eventually come to an end after the American Revolution in the late 1700s. The country was also undergoing significant social and cultural changes. The Enlightenment brought about a shift in intellectual thought, questioning established beliefs and promoting individualism and reason. It was a time when gender roles were strictly defined, with the expectation women would adhere to societal norms of femininity and domesticity, however, Charke defied these expectations, choosing to pursue a career in the male-dominated world of theater.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nPrior to Charke's time in the mid-1700s, the autobiography was still not quite popularized. In fact, the modern autobiography did not become common, or popular, until the nineteenth century. Finding the existence of such narratives before the eighteenth century is nearly impossible and even the modern autobiography is considered to still be fairly new. Despite the autobiography becoming more common during Charke's time, it is said there are around “four hundred in total” published in the 1700s. Moreover, of those published, many women who wrote their own narratives tended to be preachers or actresses like Charke. In narratives such as these, women were said “constructing the selves they are, or want their audience to believe they are, often in opposition to received opinions”\nAdditionally, Great Britain at this time, the country was entering an important period of literature, culture, and the arts that continue to be important for the modern day. Some of these novels include Gulliver’s Travels, and Robinson Crusoe which detail a fictional character's individual adventures. As these novels became popular during the time period, Charlotte Charke's narration builds on this sense of individual adventure and the public's taste for such stories.\n\n\n=== Key historical figures ===\nAs the daughter of the famous playwright Colley Cibber, Charke grew up surrounded by the theatrical world. Despite her father's disapproval, she embarked on a career as an actress, facing challenges and discrimination due to her gender. Charke's autobiography sheds light on the struggles she faced as a woman trying to navigate the male-dominated world of theater, providing a unique insight into the gender dynamics of 18th-century England. One of the key figures in Charke's life was her father, Colley Cibber who played a significant role in shaping her career and personal life. His disapproval of Charke's chosen profession as an actress highlights the societal attitudes towards women in the 18th century. His reluctance to support his daughter's career aspirations reflects the pervasive gender bias that existed during that time. Another influential figure in Charke's life was her husband, Richard Charke, a musician who struggled with his own demons and addictions. Their tumultuous relationship and eventual separation added another layer of complexity to Charke's narrative, showcasing the challenges faced by women in maintaining personal autonomy and independence during a time when marriage and family were considered the ultimate goals for women.\n\n\n== Themes ==\n\n\n=== Gender ===\nCharke’s gender fluidity is one of the most prominent themes throughout the autobiography. Charke begins bending her gender through her attire from as young as four years old, when she puts on an adolescent performance by strolling around her neighborhood in her father’s stolen clothing. This is something she continues doing as she grows up and becomes more involved in the theater. The varying attire throughout her autobiography allows Charke to “use clothing to bend her gender, sex, social status, and identity” and by doing so as frequently as she does, “her body becomes a manifestation of gender fluidity.” Additionally, Charke uses objects and props as tools for her gender expression. Returning to the previous example of her dressing up at age four, Charke’s use of both broom and sword are phallic symbols that help her present masculinely. The broom is what she uses to actually gain access to Cibber’s clothes and wig, giving her the opportunity “to enter into the performance of her desired gender.” Then, she swaps the broom for a sword, which hinders her ability to move around freely, yet is the finishing touch on her performance. The way in which Charke picks and disgards these phallic symbols “emphasize the fluidity in her performance… as well as the awkwardness of a gender binary.” Charke is never truly ashamed of her cross-dressing and gender fluidity (except, perhaps, when it comes to the strenuous relationship she has with her father). She crossdresses liberally and repeatedly to gain new economic opportunities and escape tricky situations whenever and wherever she could. Despite this continuous use of cross-dressing, Charke never openly reveals her motivations for doing so. Rather than give readers an explanation, Charke’s audience is forced to face the “awkwardness one can feel when confronted with genders that move beyond the binarized matrix” of male and female.\n\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nThrough Charke’s cross-dressing and embracement of both feminine and masculine identities, Charke’s sexuality is critically debated. There are some critics who believe that Charke’s cross-dressing has nothing to do with her sexuality at all, and that her cross-dressing and embracing masculine ideals is motivated more so by her need to subvert her father. Other critics' perspectives largely view Charke’s transgressive actions of cross-dressing and taking on typical male roles as something that aligns more with her gender identity rather than her sexuality, especially when considering that Charke never explicitly acknowledges her cross-dressing is due to her sexuality (though she does state it is not anyone’s business other than her own). Other critics call upon other women’s attraction to Charke while she is in disguise in order to suggest that “Charke’s self-representation displaces gendered norms from centrality and attempts instead to construct a specifically sexual identity inconsistent with gender’s binary codes.” These critics acknowledge her gender and sexuality as being linked, and that in the record of her life, she does call attention to how other women find her sexually attractive when she is passing as a man. Charke finds joy in how she is able to “keep up to the well-bred Gentlemen.”  While the text does not contain many implications of sexuality outside of her two husbands, critics argue there is implicit reference of Charke’s sexual preference towards women.\n\n\n=== Performance ===\nCharlotte Charke’s father was Colley Cibber, a playwright and theater owner, and therefore she grew up acting in a multitude of plays. Because of Charke’s prolific career as an actress, many critics discuss how the theater and performance are intertwined into the narrative. Her attachment to the theater is also indicated by her numerous references to popular plays of the time in her narrative, as well as her consistent return to the stage throughout her life. Thus, it makes sense that her autobiography itself could be seen as a performance. This becomes evident at the very beginning of A Narrative, when Charke writes and addresses a letter to herself. Immediately, her identity is destabilized as she splits into “herself as the autobiographer and the subject of her autobiography.\" The splintering of her identity makes it become something that she can perform, making Charke both the playwright and the starring actress of her own story.\nThe theme of performance also ties back into Charke's gender identity and expression as she navigates societal expectations and challenges traditional gender norms through her various roles on and off the stage. Because of the shift in gender perceptions of the eighteenth century, a theatrical performance by an actor was closely associated to the true character of the person playing the role; instead of an actor embodying a role only for the stage, the audience's perception of such character performance became recognized as the identity of the performer themselves. Charke toyed with this idea as she “flits between the many different positions of identity that she takes on both onstage and off… Charlotte never really lets the reader know when her performance as a ‘man’ has stopped and when that of a ‘woman’ has begun.\" Through her performance of gender, she twists the norms of the time and manages to exist in a space between the binary of male and female. Charke also performs gender throughout her life through her cross-dressing and varying jobs. Some scholars argue that “as [Charke] flits between the many different positions of identity that she takes on both onstage and off Charlotte never really lets the reader know when her performance as a ‘man’ has stopped and when that of a ‘woman’ has begun.\" However, through her use of clothing, wigs, and objects, Charke reveals the seams of her performance of different genders. By bringing attention to such material objects, Charke “invites the audience… to take part in active reading and interpretation—and to pay attention to her performance.\" By performing gender, Charke is able to exist between the binary of male and female. As Higa argues, “[Charke’s] gender performances are neither definitively male nor definitively female, and we cannot argue that she moves back and forth between polarities if she is constantly residing between or beyond them.\"\n\n\n=== Comedy ===\nThroughout Charke’s narrative there is a continuous theme of humor and comedy. She begins the narrative by dedicating the author’s statement to herself, then proceeds to exaggerate and poke fun at her own writing ability, “Tho’ flattery is universally known to be the Spring from which Dedications frequently flow, I hope I shall escape that Odium so justly thrown on poetical Petitioners, notwithstanding my Attempt to illustrate those wonderful qualifications by which you have so eminently distinguished yourself, and gives you claim to the title of a non-pareil of the age” and “I am certain, there is no one in the World more fit than myself to be laughed at.\" Charke’s sense of humor is maintained throughout the entire piece as she weaves and incorporates it throughout both her melancholy and joyous moments of her life. However, critics of her time often overlooked this comedic theme, considering Charke’s humor to be a miserable yearning to appease her father and an attempt to enter into his good graces once again. Other critics, such as Sue Churchill, argue Charke’s clear use of comedy defies her supposed misery. She states that though Charke lived an obviously turbulent lifestyle, Charke continually undercut her sadness with laughter. For example, when Charke dresses in her father’s clothes as a child, rather than enjoying the clothes just for herself, she ventures out into the crowd, choosing to entertain the masses rather than to shy away from attention. She delights in the joy and laughter of the crowd, only becoming upset when she is removed from their watch. Churchill suggests that previous critics miss the jokes Charke wrote, and did not understand the knowledge and interpretations Charke exhibits both on literary form and the theater culture of the time.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was first published in Analog Science Fiction in October 1968.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nHuman merchants sell internal combustion engines to a planet whose inhabitants view the devices as magic — and when the humans leave, the engines stop working, because internal combustion only functions in the presence of a psionic field unknowingly emitted by humans.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\"The Steiger Effect\" was a finalist for the 1969 Hugo Award for Best Short Story.\nGalactic Journey noted that \"'Humans secretly have psi powers and don't know it' certainly sounds like a plot tailor-made for [Analog editor] Campbell\", and observed that the aliens' social stratification (\"Men\" who use their minds, and \"Boys\" who use their muscle) was uncomfortably evocative of \"antebellum days in the American South\".\n\n\n== Title ==\nHistorian Maggie Thompson – Curtis's daughter – has described the story's premise as \"there are people who have a sort of 'repairing field' [said Steiger Effect] around them – which is why, for example, your car runs fine when you have it at the service station but renews the grinding noise after you've driven away\", and noted that \"[o]ur local service station was run by Mr. Steiger.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Chukarska reka (Bulgarian: Чукарска река) is a 37 km long river in eastern Bulgaria that flows into Lake Burgas, which drains into the Black Sea.\nThe river takes its source from the northern slope of the peak of Shumnoto Kale (376 m) in the Hisar Heights at an altitude of 325 m, about one kilometer west of the village of Chukarka. It flows in direction southeast through the Burgas Plain in a wide valley covered with farmlands. The river flows into the westernmost edge of Lake Burgas some 3 km southwest of the Dolno Ezerovo neighbourhood of the city of Burgas. The lake itself drains into the Gulf of Burgas in the Black Sea. \nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 129 km2. It borders the basins of Aytoska reka to the northeast, the Rusokastrenska reka to the southeast, both flowing into the Black Sea, and shares a short boundary with the Tundzha basin to the northwest, the largest tributary of the Maritsa that belongs to the Aegean Sea drainage. The river has predominantly rain feed with high water in February–March and low water in August–September.\nThe Chukarska reka flows entirely in Burgas Province in the municipalities of Aytos, Kameno and Burgas. There are three villages along its course, Chukarka, Vratitsa and Ravnets. Its waters are utilised for irrigation. \n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "A mesokaryote or mesokaryotic organism is a single-celled eukaryote that shows intermediate resemblance to both prokaryotes and 'higher' eukaryotes. The term originates from a 1965 hypothesis by John David Dodge, who proposed that certain eukaryotes (mainly dinoflagellates) with closed mitosis and other traits considered 'primitive' were an intermediate step between prokaryotes and the remaining eukaryotes. This idea originated in the late 20th century, and was later disproven by more detailed ultrastructural studies in the following decades.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first investigations of the dinoflagellate nucleus, during the 1950s-1960s, revealed a fine nucleus and chromosome structure that was completely different from other nucleated organisms or eukaryotes, lacking histones and with a permanently condensed chromatin. Based on these findings, the phycologist John David Dodge proposed in 1965 the concept of Mesocaryota (or mesokaryotes) under the hypothesis that these features were an intermediate nuclear organization between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This hypothesis led to the theory that dinoflagellates were the first to evolve from the split with prokaryotes, followed by the remaining eukaryotes. The traits considered by Dodge to define Mesocaryota were: lack of detectable histones; absence of a mitotic spindle; continuous DNA synthesis; chromatin fibrils arranged in arched swirls as in bacterial nucleoids; and chromosomes permanently condensed persistently adhered to the nuclear envelope, which remains intact throughout mitosis (i.e., it is a closed mitosis).\nThe mesokaryote hypothesis was disproven in the following decades through more detailed observations of the criteria listed above. For example, detailed studies on the parasitic Syndinium demonstrated the presence of an unconventional type of basic histone-like proteins and of an extranuclear mitotic spindle in dinoflagellates, similarly to 'higher' eukaryotes. Dinoflagellates remained considered a group of ancient but true eukaryotes. With the improvement of molecular phylogenetics, dinoflagellates, like other groups that exhibited closed mitosis, were instead revealed to be derived, branching within the Alveolata, whose members have conventional nuclei. Thus, these traits were reinterpreted as highly derived. Due to its short lifespan, the mesokaryote hypothesis has had little impact.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dylan Besseau (born September 15, 1997) is a French filmmaker and producer born in Vietnam. He won an honorable mention at SWIFF 2023 and selected for the Justice Documentary Festival Paris 2023.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHe followed his schooling at the private Catholic institution Saint-Gabriel/Saint-Michel in the commune of Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre. He obtained his general baccalaureate ES at the private high school of Brittany in 2014. Then, he began a university course at the faculty of law in Nantes in 2015, but abandoned his studies to reorient himself to study cinema in art school, after being struck by seeing the film The Handmaiden.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 2018, he studies in art school. The same year, he followed audiovisual internships in various associations, where he carried out some projects in co-production with France 3 Pays de la Loire.\nIn 2019, he began his career with director Jean-Yves Bilien. He directs the short film The Sozo Girl and Happiness based on the song Like a Blooming Season in collaboration with Shin Hae Gyeong.\nIn 2021, he created the audiovisual agency Artwooks Media and directed the feature-length documentary La légende de Thierry Mauvignier about the director Thierry Mauvignier, distributed on Prime Video · \nThrough this film, he is portrayed as a filmmaker who :\n\nSeems to share with us, nonetheless, a question that he appears to carry finding his more personal voice through a prescribed exercise, one in which he doesn't seem entirely comfortable or in agreement. The result, in any case, reflects this internal conflict, as the film grapples with two conflicting aspirations: the commissioned, marketing-driven objective and the desire of a young filmmaker attempting to bring forth his unique perspective.\nAccording to The Source :\n\nThe cinematographic influence of Dylan Besseau could be characterized by directors such as Kwak Jae-yong, Park Chan-wook, Wong Kar-wai, Martin Scorsese, and Chantal Akerman. In terms of form, particularly in the photography of his films, there is an attempt to highlight the entirety and composition of the shots, something inherited from Asian cinema.\nIn 2022, he created the Wooksart Foundation, a charitable audiovisual association bringing together around thirty members that will produce a short documentary film on Rotary International.\nIn 2023, he produced the documentary The Venus Chained which won the honorable mention at the SWIFF 2023 then, he directed the documentary Anne Bouillon : Justice for women with the french lawyer Anne Bouillon whose musical soundtrack composed by Keziah Chamsidini, the son of M'Toro Chamou. This film will be selected at the Justice Documentary Festival,. he's the youngest director in the selection of the first new edition.\nIn 2024, he directed the film Gevart \"a film delicately representing a tutelary figure of a doctor\" according to Bande à part (magazine). He began directing the film Blast Punch and produced the documentary Makiko on Makiko Furuichi.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Distinctions ==\n2022 : Official Selection at The Paus Premiers Festival\n2023 : Official Selection at Justice Documentary Festival Paris\n2023 : Honorable Mention at SWIFF\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDylan Besseau at IMDb\n\"Fiche de Dylan Besseau\" (in French). on SensCritique\n\"Fiche de Dylan Besseau\" (in French). on Allociné\n\"Fiche de Dylan Besseau\" (in French). on film-documentaire.fr",

It is the official aid organisation of the Congolese Catholic Church with a presence all over the country.\nThe organisation is a member of the global Caritas Internationalis confederation and of the regional Caritas Africa.\n\n\n== Background and work ==\nCaritas Congo was founded in 1960 by the Congolese Bishops Conference (CENCO) with the mission to improving the lives of individuals and communities as a whole, according to the social doctrine of the Church. The organisation was registered in 1964 and restructured in 1993.\nCaritas Congo consists as the national office, the Secrétariat exécutif (\"Executive Secretariat\"), and acts as a federation of 48 diocesan offices spread throughout the country. These organisations are called Caritas-Développement diocésaines (\"Diocesan Caritas Development\"). The 48 diocesan offices are divided into around 1,500 parish Caritas and more than 10,000 local units (cellules, \"cells\").\n\n\n== Work ==\nCaritas Congo is active in emergency relief while also providing medical services and implementing community development projects. The Executive Secretariat coordinates the work of all 48 diocesan Caritas organisations and represents them. It is also responsible for capacity strengthening and advocacy.\nIn 2023, Caritas Congo supported 2,5 million persons with a budget of 20.3 million US dollars. The main areas of activity were prevention and emergency response projects, health promotion projects and projects promoting sustainable development.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in French)\n\n\n== Literature ==\nCaritas Congo asbl: Origines, étapes historiques, réalisations, défis et perspectives, Dr. Bruni Miteyo Nyenge, ICREDES, Kinshasa, Montréal, Washington\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Livre pour quatuor (Book for quartet) is a composition for string quartet by Pierre Boulez.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe bulk of Livre pour quatuor was composed during 1948–1949, immediately following completion of the Second Piano Sonata, and contemporary with the publication of the essay \"Proposals.\" Boulez's first instrumental piece without piano, it can be seen as marking a transition between the hyper-expressivity and reliance on traditional forms found in the earlier works, culminating in the Second Sonata, with the serial experiments that followed. In a 1950 letter to John Cage, Boulez acknowledged the influence of the older composer, stating: \"Meeting you made me end a 'classical' period with my quartet.\"\nSketches for Livre pour quatuor reveal Boulez's initial experiments with applying serial techniques to both pitch and rhythm. In an interview, he recalled that he \"began by using completely independent schemes in which pitches, durations and rhythms were combined at first starting from cells, but these cells became so independent that they virtually became rhythmic series.\" Boulez would continue these experiments in the works that followed, namely Polyphonie X, Deux Études for tape, and the first book of Structures.\nLivre pour quatuor was also the first of Boulez's compositions to reflect the influence of poet Stéphane Mallarmé. Boulez noted that the idea for the quartet came to him while reading Mallarmé's Igitur and Un Coup de Dés, during which he came to see the poetry as forming \"a continuity from which sections could be detached because they had meaning and validity even when taken out of the continuous context in which they were placed.\" Boulez's quartet was initially conceived as a group of six separable movements, or \"feuillets\" (leaves), from which the performers would select the ones they wanted to play. (Although the quartet's title suggests an homage to Mallarmé's Livre, in which the pages could be read in any order, Boulez recalled that he did not read the poem until after its publication in 1957.) He would continue to explore such ideas in later works, such as the Third Piano Sonata.\nThe quartet remained in a state of flux for many years, as Boulez grappled with its technical and expressive challenges. Although he completed movements 1 (in two parts), 2, 3 (in three parts), and 5 by mid-1949, movement 6 was not completed until 1959, while movement 4 remained incomplete. He revised the piece in 1959 with the help of members of the Parrenin Quartet, and, during 2002–2012, he continue the revisions, working with the Diotima Quartet.\nOver the years, as Boulez attended performances of individual sections of the work, he grew dissatisfied with it due to the numerous performative challenges resulting from his inexperience at the time it was written. He concluded that it \"posed great interpretative problems for a quartet,\" and suggested that \"you would need a conductor to solve them.\" In the late 1960s, he withdrew the work from his catalogue, requesting that it no longer be performed except by quartets that had already rehearsed and played it, and began rewriting it for string orchestra. His recomposition of the two-part first movement became Livre pour cordes (1968), while rewrites of the remaining movements remained forever incomplete.\n\n\n== Music ==\nMusicologist Richard Toop observed that, in comparison with the works that preceded it, Livre pour quatuor lacks the \"explosive dynamism\" of the Second Piano Sonata as well as the \"seductive lyricism\" of Le Soleil des eaux. Boulez himself commented: \"The mere fact of using a string quartet brought with it a certain reticence, a certain restraint.\" On the other hand, the music is characterized by rapid timbral and dynamic changes, in conjunction with the use of a wide variety of string techniques (sul ponticello, pizzicato, col legno, etc.), as well as a tendency for the four instrumental voices to cross, blurring their traditional registral identities. Boulez also noted the contrast between passages that he characterized as \"austere\" and \"rigid\" with others that are more \"supple,\" and that produce \"an impression of flexibility and improvisation.\"\n\n\n== Premiere and publication ==\nThe work was premiered in fragments, beginning on 15 October 1955, when the Marschner Quartet played movements 1 and 2 at a concert in Donaueschingen, Germany. Movements 5 and 6 were performed on 9 September 1961 in Darmstadt, Germany, by the Hamann Quartet, while the Parrenin Quartet played movements 3 in Darmstadt on 8 July 1962. Movements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 were first performed together on 31 March 1985 by the Arditti Quartet. The score was published by Heugel. \n\n\n== Reconstruction of fourth movement ==\nIn 2018, at the invitation of violinist Irvine Arditti, composer Philippe Manoury and musicologist Jean-Louis Leleu worked together on reconstructing and finishing the incomplete fourth movement. The entire quartet, including the fourth movement, was premiered on 10 April 2018, by both the Arditti Quartet at Berlin's Pierre Boulez Saal and the Diotima Quartet at the Philharmonie de Paris. A complete edition of the score was published by Leduc.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewing a recording of the work by the Diotima Quartet, Andrew Clements wrote: \"It's music that, as the composer himself said, veers between 'intentionally austere bareness' and 'the most proliferating exuberance'... It's sometimes rapturously beautiful, sometimes chillingly detached; in many ways it's the most revealingly personal work that Boulez ever composed.\" In a review of a live performance, Richard Fairman of the Financial Times stated that the piece \"is no doubt meticulously organised, though the listener is pushed to hear how,\" and noted its \"intricate, seemingly random detail.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSources\n\nBoulez, Pierre (1976).

It was recorded on June 2, 1979, at the 8th Moers International New Jazz Festival in Moers, Germany, and was released on vinyl later that year by Moers Music.\nThis lineup of the Altschul trio would go on to record the studio album Brahma for the Sackville label the following year.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for AllMusic, Scott Yanow wrote: \"The four lengthy originals... have their moments, but there are also meandering sections... Most of the sparks are provided by the virtuosic and eccentric Anderson; Helias has a strong bowed spot on the episodic 'Martin's Stew,' which is easily the strongest performance of the four.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings described the album as \"a dialogue of the deaf,\" and commented: \"Trios of this conformation are always difficult to modulate effectively. What happens here is that three players with strongly rhythmic conceptions of their own manage to cancel each other out.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Somewhere Else\" (Barry Altschul) – 13:30\n\"Slickaphonic Shuffle\" (Ray Anderson) – 9:38\n\"Onea\" (Mark Helias) – 6:38\n\"Martin's Stew\" (Barry Altschul) – 16:17\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nBarry Altschul – drums, cymbals, bells, gong, quica, waterphone, gongs, assorted percussion\nRay Anderson – trombone, kalimba, Brasilian whistles\nMark Helias – double bass\n\n\n== References ==",

This season will undergo a new format.\nThe winner and the runner-up will qualify for the 2024 Challenger Cup.\nThe tournament has two divisions: the Golden League, which featured 12 teams, and the Silver League, which featured 4 teams.\n\n\n== Format change ==\nThe CEV announced a change to the format starting this season after a decision was made by the CEV Board of Administration on 16 September 2023 in Rome. Starting this season, the CEV will adjust a format similar to the FIVB Volleyball Nations League. This format change was made with consultation with the participating nations to reduce costs.\n\n\n== Pools composition ==\nTeams were seeded according to their European Ranking for national teams as of 9 October 2023.

When the tie in point quotient is between three or more teams, these teams ranked taking into consideration only the matches involving the teams in question.\n\n\n=== League phase ===\nAll times are local.\n\n\n==== Matches ====\nWeek 1\n\n\n===== Tournament 1 =====\nVenue:  Heydar Aliyev Sports and Concert Complex, Baku, Azerbaijan\n\n\n===== Tournament 2 =====\nVenue:  Arena Park Sports Hall, Strumica, North Macedonia\n\n\n===== Tournament 3 =====\nVenue:  Hakametsä Arena, Tampere, Finland\n\n\n===== Tournament 4 =====\nVenue:  Pavilhão Municipal Professor Joaquim Vairinhos, Loulé, Portugal\n\nWeek 2\n\n\n===== Tournament 5 =====\nVenue:  d'Coque, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg\n\n\n===== Tournament 6 =====\nVenue:  Palacio de Deportes de Gijón, Gijón, Spain\n\n\n===== Tournament 7 =====\nVenue:  Traian Sports Hall, Râmnicu Vâlcea, Romania\n\n\n===== Tournament 8 =====\nVenue:  Topsporthal, Beveren, Belgium\n\nWeek 3\n\n\n===== Tournament 9 =====\nVenue:  Rakvere Sports Hall, Rakvere, Estonia\n\n\n===== Tournament 10 =====\nVenue:  Gradski vrt Hall Smaller Hall, Osijek, Croatia\n\n\n===== Tournament 11 =====\nVenue:  Sport Hall for Indoor Games, Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic\n\n\n===== Tournament 12 =====\nVenue:  Arena Jaskółka, Tarnów, Poland\n\n\n=== Final four ===\nThe Final four will be held in the Croatia.\n\n\n== Silver League ==\n\n\n=== Schedule ===\nThe schedule is as follows:\n\n\n=== Tiebreaker ===\nTotal number of victories (matches won, matches lost)\nIn the event of a tie, the following first tiebreaker will apply: The teams will be ranked by the most point gained per match as follows:\nMatch won 3–0 or 3–1: 3 points for the winner, 0 points for the loser\nMatch won 3–2: 2 points for the winner, 1 point for the loser\nMatch forfeited: 3 points for the winner, 0 points (0–25, 0–25, 0–25) for the loser\nIf teams are still tied after examining the number of victories and points gained, then the FIVB will examine the results in order to break the tie in the following order:\nSet quotient: if two or more teams are tied on the number of points gained, they will be ranked by the quotient resulting from the division of the number of all set won by the number of all sets lost.\nPoints quotient: if the tie persists based on the set quotient, the teams will be ranked by the quotient resulting from the division of all points scored by the total of points lost during all sets.\nIf the tie persists based on the point quotient, the tie will be broken based on the team that won the match of the Round Robin Phase between the tied teams.

        "content": "New productive forces (Chinese: 新质生产力; pinyin: Xīn zhí shēngchǎnlì), also called new quality productive forces, is a political slogan promoted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It was coined by Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a visit to Heilongjiang in 2023 to promote manufacturing and innovation in the Chinese economy.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe term was first mentioned by Chinese leader Xi Jinping during an inspection trip in Heilongjiang Province in September 2023, where he for a new economic model based on innovation in advanced sectors and for China to \"lead the development of strategic emerging industries and future industries\".\nFrom 11 to 12 December 2023, during the Central Economic Work Conference, Xi said the \"core of deepening supply-side structural reform is to promote industrial innovation through scientific and technological innovation, especially disruptive and cutting-edge technologies to spawn new industries, new models, new drivers, and develop new productive forces\".\nOn 5 March 2024, on the sidelines the second session of the 14th National People's Congress, Xi addressed deputies from Jiangsu Province, calling for local governments to develop new productive forces based on their local conditions in order prevent the formation of bubbles or adaptation of a single economic model. He also said \"developing new productive forces does not mean neglecting or abandoning traditional industries\" but rather to \"use new technologies to transform and upgrade traditional sectors and actively promote high-end, intelligent and green industries\". On the same day, the State Council listed new productive forces as a top priority in a government report.\nIn 2024, Xi'an University of Science and Technology established a \"New Quality Productive Forces Research Center\", to be led by university president Lai Xingping. From Xi's first mention of the term in September 2023 to 1 May 2024, the term appeared on Chinese academic database CNKI 1,073 times.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe New York Times describes the focus on new productive forces as increasing innovation and economic growth by large investments in manufacturing, especially on high-tech and clean energy sectors, as well as more spending on research and development.\nIn March 2024, Xinhua News Agency said in contrast to \"traditional productive forces\" the new productive forces are an \"advanced productivity that plays a leading role in innovation and breaks away from the traditional economic growth mode and productivity development path\". It says it features \"high technology, high efficiency, and high quality\".\nState media has used it to refer to industries ranging from tourism to the \"new three\"; electric vehicles, batteries and renewable energy. Xi has said the test for new productive forces will be whether they will be able to generate improvements in total factor productivity. Xi also said the new productive forces will come from the application of science and technology to production. Study Times of the Central Party School called the term as a development of the theory of the productive forces from Marxism and said it further enriches Xi Jinping Though on Economics.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Azadiradione is a naturally occurring compound found in several plants, most notably the neem tree (Azadirachta indica). It is a tetracyclic triterpenoid.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAzadiradione is the principal active ingredient in neem oil, which is extracted from the seeds of the neem tree.  Smaller quantities of azadiradione can also be found in other plants like Cedrela odorata (Spanish cedar), Chisocheton siamensis, Xylocarpus granatum (cannonball mangrove) and Azalea indica (common azalea).\n\n\n== Applications ==\nAzadiradione acts as an antioxidant and has been used  in traditional medicine in Asia, Africa and the Middle East for ages.\nResearch suggests azadiradione may have properties that fight microbes (bacteria, fungi, viruses), reduce inflammation, protect cells from damage, and even have anti-cancer effects.\nAzadiradione may also act as a natural pesticide, potentially controlling some insects and pests.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The new Brazilian secondary education is a government educational policy instituted by Federal Law No. 13,415 of 2017, based on Provisional Measure No. 746 of 2016, which caused the secondary school reform. It aims to provide flexibility in the subjects taught to secondary school students in Brazil, establishing compulsory and optional disciplines. It also includes an increase in the workload over the years. Mendonça Filho, then Minister of Education, believed that the reform would help combat school dropouts and encourage the expansion of full-time education. Critics claim that it will weaken basic education in Brazil.\nOn February 8, 2017, the Provisional Measure was approved in the Senate by 43 votes to 13; on February 16, it was sanctioned by President Michel Temer. The text divides the content of secondary education into 60% compulsory subjects, which will be defined by the Common National Curriculum Base (BNCC), and 40% optional subjects. Students must choose an area of interest among languages, mathematics, humanities, natural sciences and vocational education.\nSchools will have a deadline to increase their workload from 800 hours a year to 1,000 hours (or from four hours a day to five hours a day), in order to gradually implement full-time teaching. The annual workload must reach 1,400 hours, but there is no deadline for this.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2013, a secondary school reform proposal by Reginaldo Lopes, a federal deputy from Minas Gerais affiliated to the Workers' Party (PT), was being discussed in the Chamber of Deputies under Bill No. 6.840. At the time, he claimed that the secondary school curriculum was outdated, had too many compulsory subjects and didn't recognize the individual differences of the students. \n\n\n== Definitions and objectives ==\nThe secondary school curriculum was defined by the Common National Curriculum Base (BNCC). The document is composed of 4 areas of knowledge plus 1 area of technical and vocational training. One of the aims of the project is to promote an increase in the workload in order to meet target 6 of the National Education Plan (PNE), which stipulates that 50% of schools and 25% of enrolments in basic education should be in full-time education by 2024.\n\n\n== Reception and repercussions ==\n\nThe reform is considered controversial and has divided the opinions of educators. Students held large mobilizations across Brazil, especially in the states of Minas Gerais and Paraná, against the amendment. Deputy Thiago Peixoto (PSD-GO) stated that the protests were partly due to misinformation about the content of the provisional measure. One of the main points of praise for the proposal is that it makes subjects more flexible.\nDaniel Cara, general coordinator of the National Campaign for the Right to Education, is one of the main critics of the reform. A citizen from Rio Grande do Sul sent a bill to the Federal Senate via the e-Citizenship Portal suggesting that philosophy and sociology become compulsory subjects in high school. The suggestion was included by the Human Rights Commission in Bill No. 2579 of 2019.\n\n\n=== Protests against the new secondary education ===\nProtests to repeal the new secondary school system took place on March 15, 2023, in 56 cities across Brazil. The new format, which became compulsory in 2022, has been the target of much criticism, especially regarding the reduction in the workload of traditional subjects. The demonstrators, mostly secondary school students, called on the Lula government to repeal the current model, while the Minister of Education, Camilo Santana, admitted that it was necessary to make \"adjustments\".\n\n\n== Application schedule ==\nIn June 2021, the Ministry of Education announced the timetable for implementing the secondary school reform, which began in 2022 and ended in 2024, when the ENEM became aligned with the new format. After protests and criticism from students and civil organizations, the reform schedule was suspended for 90 days.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPresidency of Michel Temer\nBrazil labor reform\n2016 student protests in Brazil\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Another complaint is the introduction and subsequent practice of sexual activities by underage individuals within the club venues. A different complaint is the lack of adequate adult supervision within the premises of these clubs.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rite Here Rite Now is an upcoming American 2024 concert film directed by Tobias Forge and Alex Ross Perry. It features Swedish rock band Ghost performing at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, on the final two North American dates of their 2023 Imperatour concert tour. The film will also include a narrative story based on a web series produced by the band, which incorporates fictional characters and lore surrounding them.\nRite Here Rite Now is set to be released in cinemas globally by Trafalgar Releasing on June 20 and 22, 2024.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film documents two Ghost shows performed during their Imperatour concert tour, which were held at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, on September 11 and 12, 2023. Unlike other shows on the tour, a strict no-phone policy was implemented for attendees of the Kia Forum shows.\nIn addition to concert footage, Rite Here Rite Now will contain a narrative story based on fictional lore surrounding the band. The credit list indicates that the actors who play Papa Nihil and Sister Imperator—two characters associated with the band's lore—will be appearing in the film.\n\n\n== Production ==\nGhost frontman Tobias Forge stated that when the band signed with their label, Loma Vista Recordings, the CEO Tom Whalley asked what the story of the band was. Tobias responded, \"if he wanted a story, I could come up with one. This film is the fruit of that conversation.\"\nDirector Alex Ross Perry has stated that the inspirations for the film range from the Sex Pistols film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle to the work of Ralph Bakshi to Kiss's Alive II.\nDirector Perry and cinematographer/editor Robert Kolodny have worked on several Ghost releases, including the music video for the band's cover of the Genesis song \"Jesus He Knows Me\" as well as the mockumentary Metal Myths: Ghost Pt. 2.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nRite Here Rite Now at IMDb",

        "content": "The Lycus (Greek: Λύκος, romanized: Lykos, lit. \"wolf\"; Turkish: Bayrampaşa Deresi) is a stream, now vaulted over, that flowed in Constantinople (today's Istanbul), important for historical reasons. The only waterway present within the walled city, it was covered in the 1950s to build the Vatan Caddesi (now Adnan Menderes Vatan Caddesi) avenue.\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe Lycus, which was six kilometers long, was the only drainage channel for the walled city.  The maximum width of the valley it formed was 3.5 km and occupied one-third of the area of Byzantine Constantinople.\nIts springs are located in the heights of the Topçular neighborhood, in the northern part of the present-day Bayrampaşa district, about 3.5 km northwest of the Edirne (Adrianople) Gate (Turkish: Edirne Kapişi) of the Theodosian walls. Geographically, the creek separated the seventh hill of the city (located to the west) from the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth. Administratively, it marked the boundary between the twelfth regio (located to the west) and the rest of the city. \nThe Lycus reached the walls of Constantinople between the gates of Carisius and St. Romanus (corresponding to modern Edirnekapı and Topkapı), just south of the Fifth Military Gate, passed under the walls and entered the city. At that point a tower, now known as \"Sulukule,\" meaning \"water tower\", protected the river. The creek continued its course inside the walls, in a valley made fertile by the watercourse, named  for that reasonYenibahce (\"new garden\" in Turkish) by Turks. It headed southeast, passing south of Lips Monastery and reached the Forum Bovis. There it turned abruptly southward, touching the heights of Avretpazar, running just before its mouth through a plain called Aksaray (\"white palace\" in Turkish), perhaps after a building inhabited by Empress Irene in the early ninth century. The watercourse finally flowed into the Sea of Marmara at the Harbour of Theodosius, also called the Harbour of Eleutherios.\n\nAlthough the water regime of the watercourse was stream-like, and thus with little water for most of the year, the heavy rains that fell especially in February brought a lot of dirt into the stream, which flowed into the west and northwest parts of the harbor. To prevent the silting up of the southeastern part, a wall was therefore built that divided the harbor into two parts and acted as a barrier. Although the sheltered part of the harbor held out longer than the rest of the basin, it too was eventually filled in by sediment. Due to that, from the 12th-13th centuries the siltation caused by the creek gradually caused the harbor to disappear, creating in its place the area called Vlanga or Langabostanı, which was used for vegetable cultivation until relatively recent times.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe area of its estuary, originally a marsh and later then due to sea level rise a body of water, hosted a Neolithic settlement, and eventually the area became the Byzantine harbour of Theodosius.\nThe Lycus valley was never much inhabited in the Byzantine period, but it was a favored place for the settlement of Greek Orthodox monasteries: famous were those of Dios and Ikasia (or Cassia), Cocorobion and Lips. \nAncient Ottoman maps of the city show that the lower course of the creek, south of the Lips monastery, had become a subterranean waterway. There are hints that these works were done during the Byzantine period.\nThe section of the the city walls which crossed the valley in the north of the city, lower than the surrounding heights, was the weakest of the entire defensive circle, and in fact it was from there that the Ottomans penetrated the city on the morning of May 29, 1453.\nThe valley remained sparsely inhabited until Istanbul's explosive population increase, but then the area under vegetable gardens began to decline until it disappeared in the late twentieth century. In the period 1956-1957 a new road, the Vatan Caddesi (now Adnan Menderes Vatan Caddesi), was built directly over the riverbed, which was then covered over. The Lycus was briefly uncovered during the construction of the M1 subway line, which connects the city center to the Atatürk Airport.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nvan Millingen, Alexander (1899).

        "content": "The Hollow Brook Road Bridge is a historic truss bridge that carries Hollow Brook Road over a tributary of the Lamington River in Tewksbury Township of Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States. Built around 1880, the steel bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2002, for its significance in engineering and transportation. It was listed as part of the Historic Bridges of Tewksbury Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey Multiple Property Submission (MPS).\nThe bridge is a single-span, pony truss bridge that carries a narrow road over the Hollow Brook, a tributary of the Lamington River. It was built using a variation of a Bollman truss or Fink truss. According to the nomination form, this is the only example in the county of this type.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Hunterdon County, New Jersey\nList of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ramon Fernandez (February 16, 1916 - March 25, 1997) was a former associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. He was sworn in as a member of the Supreme Court by President Ferdinand Marcos on May 27, 1977, but resigned on May 11, 1982 after being involved in a scandal over the admission of the son of a fellow associate justice as a lawyer, in a case that also saw the resignation of the entire Supreme Court. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Libon, Albay on February 16, 1916, Fernandez obtained his pre-law degree and law degree from the University of the Philippines College of Law where he graduated in 1939.  He was a classmate of Ferdinand Marcos, who later appointed him to government positions during his presidency.\nHe taught law at the University of the Philippines, Manuel L. Quezon University, and the Philippine Law School before joining government as an undersecretary of the Department of Justice from 1968 to 1971. In 1977 he was appointed as an associate justice of the Supreme Court.\n\n\n== Resignation ==\nFernandez's tenure in the Supreme Court was cut short after he was implicated in a scandal over the conduct of the 1981 Philippine Bar Examinations that were overseen by the court. In March 1982, Associate Justice Ameurfina Melencio-Herrera publicly said that the mercantile law grades of Associate Justice Vicente Ericta's son Gustavo, who took the examination, was changed from 56 to 58 percent prior to publication of the test results to enable him to pass with a general average of 73 and become a fully-pledged lawyer. Chief Justice Enrique Fernando subsequently admitted ordering the revision in the younger Ericta's grade but denied allegations of unethical behavior, saying that it was done to correct an \"oversight\" by the examiner upon the advice of justices Ramon Aquino and Fernandez, who were prematurely shown Ericta's grades, and citing a similar predicament with one of his sons, who died shortly after passing the bar exam.\nFollowing public uproar and demands for their impeachment, all 14 members of the Supreme Court, including six justices who were not directly involved in the grade tampering, submitted their resignation to President Marcos on May 11. All of them were subsequently reappointed days later by Marcos, except for Ericta and Fernandez, who were both \"found responsible\" for the scandal by a group of former justices advising the president.\n\n\n== Death ==\nFernandez died in 1997.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAssociate Justice Ramon Fernandez (Supreme Court E-Library)",

        "content": "Antonio Anguera Bernaus (17 February 1921 – 1 September 1993) was a Spanish footballer who played as a Defender for UE Lleida and FC Barcelona.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAntonio Anguera was born on 17 February 1921 in Térmens, Lleida as the son of Antoni and Brígida, and began playing football in Lleida in 1933, at the age of just 12, in the Escola del Treball de Lleida (Lleida Labor School team). Despite quickly falling in love with this sport, his parents, who ran an awning business, did not view his son's hobby very favorably, but his father's first cousin, Enric Bernaus, was his number one fan.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nAnguera played for the school team for three years until 1936, when the Spanish Civil War broke out. After the civil war ended in 1939, he joined the first team of Lérida Balompié, which would later become UE Lleida, where he played the 1939–40 season, at the age of 18. There, he quickly stood out as a great defender and eventually drew the attention of RCD Espanyol, who called him for a test in Barcelona, where he stayed at his uncles' house, who lived on Valencia Street. In the same building lived a person closely related to FC Barcelona and, when he found out about the boy's presence, he told him to go try out for Barça first, and they kept him, signing him in 1940, at 19 years old.\n\n\n=== FC Barcelona ===\nAnguera made his official debut for Barcelona in the opening game of the 1940–41 La Liga on 29 September, which ended in a humiliating 11–1 loss to Sevilla CF. He quickly established himself as an undisputed starter, since he always offered his best and gave everything for the Barça shirt. His promising career, however, was cut short on 9 February 1941 in Balaídos, where he received a severe blow to his Achilles' heel, a setback that did not prevent him from finishing the match, which Barça won 1–4, but it did leave him absent from the next one against Real Murcia, before reappearing against Real Madrid and also playing in the final match of the league season against Athletic Bilbao on 2 March 1941. Anguera also played three matches in the 1941–47 FEF President Cup, including a 1–1 draw with Valencia in which Mundo got a red card for an attempted attack on him.\nHowever, the annoyances were always there and they did not disappear. In the following season, 1941–42, Anguera did not play until the sixth matchday, against Real Sociedad in San Sebastián (2–0), but he had to take a step back after a match against Granada CF on 15 February 1942, which was his last official match. While at Barça, the club won the 1942 Copa del Generalísimo, but he did not contribute to the title since he did not play any cup match due to the discomfort he suffered. Before the matches in Les Corts, \"they warmed up on the way to the field, walking with a firm step and taking a carajillo in the bar before dressing in shorts\". In total, he played 37 official matches for Barça.\nIn Barcelona, he cultivated friendships with Manuel Rosalén, José Bravo, and the presidents Marqués de la Mesa de Asta and Josep Vendrell.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nAnguera had to have surgery, but his father told him to \"stop fooling around, to get to work\", but Anguera kept pursuing his passion and, with great pain, returned to Lérida Balompié in the 1942–43 season, although his injured heel only allowed him to line up in one match and he ended up retiring from football at the age of just 22.\n\n\n== Playing style ==\nFrom a hard-working family, Anguera transmitted these values on the field, protected by a well-built physique. Bernaus stated years later that Anguera \"was all nerve, speed, and sacrifice\".\n\n\n== Later life ==\nAfter retiring, Anguera joined the awning business run by his father, who also had a small store where he sold bags, suitcases, wallets, purses, Et cetera. He lived in Lleida, but regularly went down to Barcelona to watch their matches. On one occasion, Anguera told Nicolau Casaus, then vice-president of Barcelona, that the ex-players should have a seat in the Camp Nou, since he wanted his grandchildren to know in which team his grandfather had played, but Casaus replied that if the board did that, they would have to expand the field.\nFond of hunting, he exhausted even the dogs, and \"sometimes he returned home burdened with how tired they were\".\n\n\n== Death ==\nIn May 1989, Anguera followed Barcelona by car to the 1989 European Cup Winners' Cup final in Bern with his cousins Josep, Francesc, and Lluís Bernaus, which Barça won 2–0. He died in Lleida five months later, on 1 September 1993 at the age of 72, the victim of an illness.\nIn July 2015, his widow, the 91-year-old Nati, was presented with the 'Great dictionary of Barça players', in which Anguera shines on page 32.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alberto Lucas Ramón Aznar Tutor (18 October 1864 – 30 March 1923) was a Spanish engineer, businessman, and politician. He was a deputy for Marquina between 1920 and 1923.\nAznar was the first president of the Neguri Golf Club, a position he held until his death, and was a member of both the Real Club Marítimo del Abra and Real Sporting Club of Bilbao, presiding over the former between 1906 and 1908 and the latter between 1910 and 1911. He was also the first Marquis of Zuya, a noble title that he held from 1920 until 1923.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nAlberto Aznar was born on 18 October 1864 in Bilbao, as the fourth of the seven children of Eduardo Aznar de la Sota (1830–1902), a ship interpreter broker (maritime brokerage) in Bilbao and a senator for the province of Burgos, and of his wife, Luisa Tutor Fuentes (1840–1893). His father was first associated with his uncle Alejandro de la Sota (1820–1909), only ten years older than him, and later with his eldest son, his first cousin Ramon de la Sota.\nIn 1897, he married Jesusa de la Puente Atristain in Bilbao, with whom he had five children, Emilio (1898–1950), María de la Concepción (1900–1986), Luisa María (1904–1992), María Isabel (1904–1965), and José Ramón Aznar de la Puente (1905–1934).\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nAfter studying at the Vizcaíno Institute, Aznar obtained the title of industrial engineer in Barcelona in 1893, specializing in mechanics. When he returned to Bilbao, he joined the family mining business and, above all, the shipping business.\nIn March 1902, Alberto and his two older brothers Eduardo and Luis María (1862–1929) formed the limited partnership A. Aznar y Compañía, in which Alberto had 15 percent of the capital and 20 percent of the profits. When their father died without a will three months later on 15 June 1902, there were quarrels between his brothers, but in the end, all three inherited their father's political affiliation linked to monarchical conservatism. Furthermore, all three were deputies and senators of the Conservative Party, as well as important shipowners and industrialists of their time.\nIn the late 1890s, Alberto and his older brother Eduardo promoted the creation of other shipping companies: Compañía del Vapor Alaveaga (1898) and Compañía del Vapor Axpe (1899), which were followed shortly by the Compañía de Navegación Bat and the Vasco Cantábrica de Navegación, with a capital of 1,250,000 pesetas. He was one of the promoters of the Asociación de Navieros de Bilbao (Bilbao Shipping Association).\nIn 1917, Aznar became part of the first board of directors of the Altos Hornos del Mediterráneo, and he was also briefly a member of the Banco of Bilbao, since the appointment was agreed on 8 March 1923.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1896, Aznar was a provincial deputy for the district of Markina. A few years later, in 1918, he ran with a group of conservatives, but lost to Indalecio Prieto, a socialist, and Pedro Chalbaud, a leader. They made a monarchical unification against the nationalists and Alberto Aznar was elected deputy to the Cortes for Markina on the candidacy of the Monarchist Action League with 75% of the votes in 1920, a position that he held for three years until 6 April, a week after his death.\nAznar was a conservative and although he was very close to Antonio Maura, he did not participate in Maura's party, despite having a similar ideology. He was a supporter of the conservative monarchy, and in 1919, he was the founder of the Las Arenas monarchical circle.\n\n\n== Sporting career ==\nAznar was the first president of the Neguri Golf Club, a position he held until his death. In 1902, the 38-year-old Aznar and his older brother Luis María were among the founding members of Real Club Marítimo del Abra, being the no. 370 and 26 respectively. He was a member of both the Real Club Marítimo del Abra and Real Sporting Club of Bilbao, presiding over the former between 1906 and 1908 and the latter between 1910 and 1911.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nOn 20 December 1920, King Alfonso XIII granted him the aristocratic title of Marquis of Zuya by royal decree. His life was spent between Bilbao and Las Arenas, where he owned the Itsaosgane palace. At the end of the First World War, he was already living in Madrid, in Calle Almagro, where he died on 30 March 1923, at the age of 58. On the third anniversary of his death, the manifest mass of the chapel of Santo Cristo de la Salud on 29 March 1926, as well as all those celebrated on 30 March, were applied in the suffrage of his soul.\nNeither his son Emilio nor his eldest daughter María de la Concepción had descendants, so when both died the noble title of Marquis of Zuya passed down to his third-born child on 3 September 1987, the 83-year-old Luisa María, who died in 1993 and was then succeeded by her daughter María de la Soledad Paloma Eulate y Aznar.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Salvia xalapensis is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, native to Mexico. Compounds obtained from Salvia xalapensis have been investigated for their possible medical or insecticidal uses. \n\n\n== Phytochemistry ==\nSalvia xalapensis is one of a number of Salvia species whose phytochemistry has been investigated, for taxonomic reasons and to study the biological activity of the compounds present, which might have medical or insecticidal uses. Four new diterpenes were among the 13 different compounds isolated from three populations of Salvia xalapensis. Two of the diterpenes had a novel molecular skeleton. An in vitro study showed that the diterpene salvixalapadiene obtained from Salvia xalapensis had potential as an insecticide against Drosophila melanogaster.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nSalvia xalapensis was first described by George Bentham in 1848. In 1844, Martin Martens and Henri Guillaume Galeotti published the name Salvia polystachya. As of May 2024, Plants of the World Online regarded this as an illegitimate synonym of Salvia xalapensis. In 1791, Antonio José Cavanilles had described a different species as Salvia polystachia (also spelt Salvia polystachya).\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Aytoska reka (Bulgarian: Айтоска река) is a 32.5 km long river in eastern Bulgaria that flows into Lake Burgas, which drains into the Black Sea.\nThe river takes its source in the western part of the Aytoska Planina division of the eastern Balkan Mountains at an altitude of 344 m, some 2.5 km north of the village of Lyaskovo. It flows in direction south–southeast through the Burgas Plain in a wide valley. The Aytoska reka flows into Lake Burgas about 2.4 km southwest of the Dolno Ezerovo neighbourhood of the city of Burgas. The lake itself drains into the Gulf of Burgas in the Black Sea. \nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 305 km2. The river has predominantly rain feed with high water in February–March and low water in August–September. The average annual flow near the town of Kameno is 0.60 m3/s.\nThe Aytoska reka flows entirely in Burgas Province in the municipalities of Aytos, Kameno and Burgas. There are two towns along its course, Aytos and Kameno. Its waters are utilised for irrigation. Along its left banks between Aytos and its mouth passes a section of the Sofia–Burgas railway line served by the Bulgarian State Railways.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "Anne Lake Cecil, Lady Roos or de Ros (1599–1630) was an English aristocrat involved in a major scandal at the Jacobean court.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nShe was the daughter of Sir Thomas Lake and his wife Mary Ryder, a daughter of William Ryder, haberdasher and Mayor of London in 1600. She was probably brought up in the family homes in Charing Cross, London, and at Cannons in Little Stanmore.\n\n\n== Lady Ros ==\n\nShe married William Cecil, 16th Baron Ros, a son of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter in 1616. The marriage broke down causing a feud between the Cecil and Lake families. Accusations and counter-accusations included rumours of affairs and poisoning attempts. It was said that the Baron Ros had an affair with his step-grandmother Frances and was the father of the 1st Earl of Exeter's youngest child.\nAnne's reputation suffered, and Lady Anne Clifford wrote in her diary that \"there were spoken extraordinarily foul matters of my Lady Ross\". Her servants Katherine Maynard and Sara Swarton were said to have spread rumours about her.\nThe Earl of Exeter brought a case for slander against Lady Ros and her family in January 1618. Lady Lake was said to have accused Lady Exeter of trying to poison Lady Ros, with a medicinal \"glister\" or \"clyster\" and syrup of roses.\nLady Ros and her maid were held in custody, Lady Ros in the keeping of the Bishop of London, and the maid with Edmund Doubleday. Luke Hatton was also held. Hatton was claimed to have informed the Lakes about the Countess of Exeter's plans, and so be the author of the slander. James VI and I took a personal interest in the proceedings and the case was heard in the Star Chamber. He considered a letter from the Countess of Exeter to Lady Ros to be a forgery. \nTestimony from the servant Sara Swarton alias Waite was discredited when the court visited the Cecil great chamber or long gallery at Wimbledon Manor. She had claimed to have overheard crucial evidence while hiding there behind tapestry and listening to the Countess of Exeter reading out loud. As the hangings did not reach the ground, Swarton or Lady Ros said she had been further concealed by a handy chair. Swarton was sentenced to be fined and branded in her cheek, and sent to the Bridewell prison for life.\n\nKing James was said have personally investigated the room at Wimbledon where Swarton alleged to have overheard the Countess of Exeter speaking or reading her writing aloud at a window. The story was related in two versions by William Sanderson in his Compleat History Of The Lives and Reigns Of Mary, Queen of Scotland, And James and Aulicus Coquinariae:To make further tryal, the king, in a hunting journy, at New Park, neer Wimbleton, gallops thither, viewes the room; observing the great distance of the window from the lower end of the room, and placing himself behind the hanging, and so other lords in turn, they could not hear one speak aloud from the window. Then the housekeeper was called, who protested those hangings had constantly furnisht that room for thirty years, which the king observed to be two foot short of the ground, and might discover the woman if hidden behind them\".\nThe Lake family were found to be at fault. Anne had to make a confession of her guilt and forgery, known as a \"recognition\" in the Star Chamber. She spent a short period in the Tower of London. Sara Swarton was released after making a public submission at St Martin-in-the-Fields.\n\n\n== Lady Rodney ==\nThe Baron Ros died in 1618. There was a rumour that Lady Ros might marry Endymion Porter.  Subsequently, in 1621, she married George Rodney, a younger son of Sir John Rodney.\nEdward Rodney, another member of the family, had married a courtier Frances Southwell, a gentlewoman in the household of Anne of Denmark in 1614 at Somerset House.\nShe died in 1630 and was buried at St Leonard's, Rodney Stoke.\n\n\n== External links ==\nTomb and effigy of Anne Lake 1630: Church Monuments Society\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "United States v. Manzi, 276 U.S. 463 (1928), was a Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that in order to receive the full benefits of citizenship, the widow of an alien who passed away after declaring his intent to become a citizen, but before being naturalized, must file her petition within the time frame set by law, at the time being 7 years after the declaration of intent was filed. This case established that when applying for citizenship, the action undertaken by an alien to become naturalized is to be understood to also be \"as though taken by the widow herself.\"\n\n\n== Historical context ==\nThis case begins with Aniello Manzi, an alien who had been undergoing the naturalization process who further filed a declaration of intention to become a citizen on October 15, 1913. Aniello, however, died on December 19, 1914, before he was finally naturalized as a citizen. This left his wife, Amalia Manzi, widowed and ultimately without citizenship. Over 10 years after her husband's declaration of intention, on October 4, 1924, Manzi using the declaration filed a petition for citizenship. She eventually did receive citizenship, and was fully naturalized on February 13, 1925, even over an objection from the government stating her petition was too late.\nOn January 9, 1926, John S. Murdock, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island filed a petition for the cancellation of Manzi's naturalization certificate on the grounds it had been \"illegally procured\". The District Court dismissed the case without an official opinion. The United States appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\n\n\n=== Court of Appeals ===\nThe Court of Appeals heard the case, and as noted by the Court, Manzi neither filed a brief nor showed up for oral arguments, leaving the United States as the sole \"voice\" in the case. Despite this, in a majority opinion written by Judge Georgia W. Anderson, of which Judge George H. Bingham and Judge Charles F. Johnson concurred, the Court rejected the historical arguments raised by the United States. With this, the United States once again appealed, this time to the United States Supreme Court.\n\n\n== United States Supreme Court ==\n\nThe Supreme Court in this case granted certiorari, and held oral arguments on February 23, 1928, and handed down its decision on April 9. Justice James C. McReynolds wrote the majority opinion for the 7-9 Court in favor of the United States, with Justice George Sutherland and Justice Edward T. Sanford dissenting. The opinion reversed the judgement of the Court of Appeals in dismissing the United States' petition for a cancellation of Manzi's certificate of naturalization. Of note, Manzi once again failed to seek representation in this case for purpose of briefs or oral arguments.\n\nIn its opinion, the Court firstly promulgated its belief that an application for citizenship within a marriage is sort of a simultaneous process, and thus the husband and wife are both subject to the same regulations and restrictions as prescribed by naturalization law. The entirety of this case was based on the Naturalization Act of 1906 and its provisions. The specific provision in question is as follows:\"Section 2. Not less than two years nor more than seven years after he has made such declaration of intention, he shall make and file, in duplicate, a petition in writing...\nSection 6. When any alien who had declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States dies before he is actually naturalized, the widow and minor children of such alien may, by complying with the other provisions of this Act, be naturalized without making any declaration of intention.\"The court goes on to recognize the very specific requirements of the act, stating a widow may \"obtain naturalization without her personal declaration of intention, [although] she must comply with all other prerequisites.\" The Court seemingly wished to err on the side of caution when dealing with naturalization law, stating,\"Citizenship is a high privilege, and when doubts exist concerning a grant of it, generally, at least, they should be resolved in favor of the United States and against the claimant.\"\n\n\n=== Dissent ===\nAlthough Justice Sutherland and Justice Sanford dissented, the published opinion did not contain a dissent in writing, nor any reasoning for why they dissented.\n\n\n== References ==",

It surveys criticism of modernity in French literature since the time of the French Revolution. Among the writers covered are Joseph de Maistre, Charles Baudelaire, Charles Péguy, Julien Gracq and Roland Barthes.\nCompagnon had been a student of Barthes in the 1970s and attributes both his teacher and himself with a kind of antimodern thought he defines as \"being a lucid modern\". The book received the 2006 Prix de la critique from the Académie Française.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGallimard",

However, the probe overseen by the 'Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity' division of the Paris High Court has seen little progress since then. Concessa, Jeanne, and Prisca assert allegations of sexual assault perpetrated by French soldiers during Operation Turquoise amidst the 1994 genocide against the Tutsis. Presently, each is navigating their lives while contending with their harrowing past. They serve as advocates, not solely for themselves, but for all women who endured male brutality during that genocide, emblematic figures in the enduring fight against historical oblivion.\n\n\n== Distinction ==\n2023: The Grand Public Prize at Justice Documentary Festival Paris\n\n\n== References ==",

The organization, founded in 2005, seeks to inform about the reasons for the revolution and to clarify historical inaccuracies. More specifically, it \"fosters discovery of the revolutionary ideas of the American founding through entertainment, education, and community projects.\"\n\n\n== Breed's Hill ==\nThe institute is named after Breed's Hill, a hill in the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown, Massachusetts, where the fighting attributed to Bunker Hill was conducted. The patriots first positioned themselves on Bunker Hill, but realized that they were at a strategic advantage by fighting on Breed's Hill, where they were closer to British positions on land and to target warships in the harbor. A plaque at the Bunker Hill Monument, a National Park, mentions Breed's Hill and the National Park Service uses the hashtag #BreedsHillNotBunkerHill in some of its social media posts. The discrepancy is a subject in the book Wicked Pissed: New England's Most Famous Feuds by Ted Reinstein, a Boston reporter.\n\n\n== Myths ==\nThey explore topics such as what percentage of the colonists were loyal to the British government and monarchy in \"The One Third Myth\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nElizabeth Burgin, the subject of The Great Raid about the release of more than 200 patriot prisoners of war from prison ships in New York Harbor\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHammrich, Amber. \"The Great Raid\". The Breeds Hill Institute.\n\"Siege of Boston - Sources for Further Reading\". Massachusetts Historical Society.\n\n\n== External links ==\nBreed Hill's Intitute website",

        "content": "Gabriel George Ludlow (April 16, 1736 – February 12, 1808) was a Loyalist military officer and politician who served as the first mayor of Canada's oldest incorporated city, Saint John, in then-colonial New Brunswick.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nGabriel George Ludlow was born on April 16, 1736, in Queens County, Long Island, in the Province of New York of then-British America. He was born to merchant Gabriel Ludlow and Frances Frances (née Duncan) Ludlow. Additionally, he was the younger brother of George Duncan Ludlow.\nLudlow served in the 3rd Battalion of the Long Island-based De Lancey's Brigade as a colonel. He later served as a King's College governor as well as a Justice of the peace. Ludlow later arrived in Parrtown with his older brother. On May 18, 1785, upon the incorporation of Saint John following the amalgamation of the Loyalist-created Parrtown and Carleton, Ludlow was sworn into office as its first mayor. According to the Telegraph-Journal, he was additionally the first mayor in Canada.\nLudlow's family, including himself, were firm supporters of slavery and were slaveowners. His father traded slaves, and whilst his older brother, George, was the first Chief Justice of New Brunswick, he also declared slavery, which he practiced, to be legal in the controversial 1799 court case R v Jones.\nLudlow also temporarily served as the acting Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn February 12, 1808, Ludlow married Anne Verplanck, sister of Gulian Verplanck, the Federalist Speaker of the New York State Assembly. They had one son, Gabriel Verplanck Ludlow, the father of Edward Hunter Ludlow. On February 12, 1808, Ludlow died in Saint John at the age of 71, and was buried at the Old Carleton Graveyard in Saint John West along with his wife.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBiography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online",

He receives the Albert Londres Prize of audiovisual.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn 2019, around 500 French children were discovered to be enduring harsh conditions in Syrian prisons, a clear violation of child protection laws. Despite pleas from their families, the French government refused to repatriate them. In January 2023, the UN condemned France for this stance, echoing previous condemnations from 2022.\nThe sole hope for these children rests with their families in France, who are advocating for their return. As of spring 2023, more than a hundred French children remain in precarious conditions in Syrian camps, their future uncertain. All this unfolds against a backdrop of mounting concerns about the resurgence of Daesh in the region.\n\n\n== Distinction ==\n2023 : Mention of the Jury at Justice Documentary Festival Paris\n2023 : Albert Londres Prize\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Madison Blues were an American semi-professional ice hockey team located in Madison, Wisconsin. The franchise was in operation for four seasons in the mid-1970s.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Blues began in 1973 as members of the United States Hockey League, then a senior circuit with teams spread across the midwest. Madison had a good first season, winning the northern division and losing in the league championship. After the year, the team transferred to the Continental Hockey League, a relatively new outfit that was more compact with clubs between Milwaukee and St. Louis. The Blues weren't quite as successful after the move but they soon recovered and won a regular season title in 1976.\nThe team was organized by Campbell Enterprises, Inc. and had a contract with the city of Madison to use the Hartmeyer Ice Arena as its home rink. Part of the agreement was that Campbell was required to make improvements to the building primarily by upgrading the facilities. The James W. Thomas Construction Co. was hired to begin the upgrades in October 1973 and finished in early 1974. Afterwards, Campbell did not pay Thomas the full amount charged, leading the construction company to sue both Campbell and the city of Madison. While the courts ultimately rules that the city was not at fault as it had not entered into any agreement with Thomas, Campbell was still required to pay for the work that had been completed. The case was decided in the summer of 1977 and shortly thereafter the team ceased to exist.\n\n\n== Season-by-season record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Internet Hockey Database",

The tournament was broadcast on ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPNU.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) began sponsoring women's beach volleyball as a championship sport in 2016, and the sport has since experienced rapid growth at the collegiate level, with a 500 percent increase in women's collegiate beach volleyball programs in the United States from 2011 to 2020. The NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship is the tournament held at the end of every regular season to determine the women's national collegiate champion across all NCAA divisions. It has been held annually since the inaugural 2016 event, and 2023 marked its seventh edition. The 2023 tournament was held in Gulf Shores, Alabama, the same venue that hosted all six previous championships, and was co-hosted by Gulf Shores Orange Beach Sports & Events, the city of Gulf Shores and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nPopularized on the beaches of California in the 1920s, beach volleyball is a sport played by two teams on a sand court. At the professional level, teams consist of a pair of players who compete in best-of-three-set matches, where the first two sets are played to 21 points and the third set, if necessary, is played to 15 points; each set must be won by a minimum two-point lead. Conversely, NCAA beach volleyball is played using a flighted team-dual format. In an NCAA dual, each team fields five individual pairs who are ranked from No. 1 to No. 5 by skill level, and each pair plays a flighted best-of-three-set match against their corresponding pair on the other team. The first team to win three of the five pairs' matches wins the dual.\nThe NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship had historically been an eight-team double-elimination tournament, in which all participating teams were selected by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. However, with the growing popularity of the collegiate sport, the NCAA agreed to double the field for the 2022 championship, adding a 16-team opening knockout round that led into the established eight-team double-elimination bracket. Along with the expanded field, the qualification process introduced eight automatic bids that teams earned by winning their respective conference tournaments. Further changes were adopted for 2023, with the tournament becoming a single-elimination-only event, and the field expanded to 17 teams to allow for nine automatic qualifiers.\n\n\n== Format and venue ==\nThe 2024 NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship is a 17-team tournament that was held from May 3 to 5, 2024. The tournament will begin on Friday, May 3, with a play-in dual between the two lowest seeded teams. The 16-team single-elimination main bracket also began on Friday, May 3, with the winning teams advancing to the quarterfinals and semifinals on Saturday, May 4, until a national champion was determined on Sunday, May 5.\nThe tournament will take place on one site at the Gulf Place Public Beach in Gulf Shores, which had been set up with five playing courts and five practice courts. Over the years, the playing conditions at the Gulf Shores venue have been characterized by several factors; namely the compact sand that makes it easier for players to move and jump, the strong winds, and the possibility of rain during that time of the year.\n\n\n== Participating teams ==\nOf the 93 eligible NCAA teams, a total of 17 qualified for the tournament and were seeded from No. 1 to No. 17. Nine of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their respective conference tournaments. The remaining eight bids were allocated at large by the NCAA Women's Beach Volleyball Committee. The qualifying teams and seeding order were announced by the committee on April 28, 2024.\n\n\n=== Automatic bids ===\nThe following nine teams earned automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments.\n\n\n=== At-large bids ===\nThe following eight teams were allocated at-large bids by the NCAA selection committee.\n\n\n=== Preview ===\n\nFrom its inception in 2016 to 2023, only two teams had won the NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship: the USC Trojans (five titles and two-time defending champion: 2016, 2017, 2021, 2022 and 2023) and the UCLA Bruins (two titles: 2018 and 2019). Both teams are in the running for the title once again in 2024.  USC entered the NCAA tournament seeded No. 1 and topping the American Volleyball Coaches Association's (AVCA) rankings.\n\n\n== Bracket ==\nThe tournament bracket is as follows:\n\n\n== Dual summaries ==\n\n\n=== Opening Round ===\nThe competition will begin with the opening round dual between the No. 16 seed North Florida and the No. 17 seed Chattanooga, in what will be the first-ever matchup between the two teams.\n\n\n== Record by conference ==\n\n\n== Broadcast and attendance ==\nThe first round duals on May 3, 2024, will be broadcast live on ESPNU and ESPN+.  The first round matchups will all be featured on ESPNU and ESPN+.  The quarterfinal and semifinal matchups will be aired on ESPN2 and ESPN+.  The National Championship matchup on May 5, 2024, will be played on ESPN and ESPN+.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Galateia Kazantzakis (Greek: Γαλάτεια Καζαντζάκη; 1884 – November 17, 1962) was a Greek novelist, poet, playwright, journalist, and activist. She is considered one of the most prolific female Greek Modernist writers.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe writer and activist was born Galateia Alexiou in Heraklion, on the Greek island of Crete, in 1884, although some sources give her birth year as 1881. Her father, Stylianos Alexiou, was a publisher and author, and her sister, Ellie Alexiou, also became a well-known writer.\nKazantzakis began her career as a journalist, with her first piece appearing in the Cretan publication Pinakothiki in 1906. She then began to publish translations from French, reviews, and short prose pieces in Pinakothiki and other publications such as the magazine Panathinea. In 1909, she published her first novella, Ridi, Pagliaccio (\"Laugh, Clown\"), in the journal Nouma. This was followed by various works including the 1915 lyric narrative Brief Prose Portraits, the 1927 short story collection 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., and, in 1933, her first novel, Women. She wrote under various pen names, including Lalo de Castro and Petroula Psiloriti.\nFrom her earliest writing, Kazantzakis advocated for feminist empowerment and the dismantling of male-dominated social structures. She notably wrote in Demotic vernacular, the language of everyday people.\nKazantzakis became increasingly involved in left-wing politics and activism during the interwar years, identifying herself as both a feminist and a socialist. She served as editor in chief of the communist publication Protoporoi and then the Trostkyist-leaning Nea Epitheorisi. In her writing, she condemned women's sexual and labor exploitation. During World War II, she was active in the Greek resistance. She would be persecuted for her communism, losing her job at the Athens municipal library after the war over her views, but she was never exiled or imprisoned at length.\nCritics argue her work has been undervalued in the shadow of her former husband Nikos Kazantzakis, a major figure in modern Greek literature known for such books as Zorba the Greek. After a year living together in Athens, in 1911, the couple married, despite the groom's father opposing the union. They would divorce in 1926. In 1933, she remarried Markos Avgeris, also a writer, whom she had known for decades, but she still published under her former husband's surname.\nIn her later years, Kazantzakis continued to produce fiction, including the short prose collection Turning Points (1952). Her last book, 1956's Humans and Superhumans, was a work of autobiographical fiction that dealt with her tumultuous relationship with her former husband. It is considered her best-known novel.\nKazantzakis was also a prolific playwright. In 1933, her play While the Ship Sails became particularly well known after it was performed by the National Theatre of Greece. Her collected plays, 17 in total, were published in 1957.\nShe died in 1962, after a motor accident in Athens.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Warblish refers to humans vocally imitating bird vocalizations using existing words and phrases in a human language. The term was coined by linguist Hannah Sarvasy in a 2017 academic paper that examined different techniques humans use to mimic birdsong.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nUnlike onomatopoeia, where nonsense words are created to sound like a bird's call, warblish uses real lexical items in a language to represent birdsong. For example, the call of the Barred Owl may be rendered as \"Who cooks for you?\" in English warblish.\nWarblish can take the form of phrases, sentences, or even dialogues attributed to birds. The meaning of the words often relates to the bird species in some way, either referring to its behavior, ecosystem role, mythology, or other cultural associations. However, warblish can also be humorous or nonsensical.\nSome examples of English warblish given by Sarvasy include:\nNorthern waterthrush: Nice old ladies don't chew tobacco\nCalifornia quail: Chicago! Chicago!\nThe sounds and meaning of warblish for the same bird species often varies across cultures. While warblish functions partly as mimicry of birdsong, features like rhythm, pitch, and timing may be more important for accuracy than the specific words used.\n\n\n== Important ==\nWhile warblish might seem trival, it has been suggested to have nontrival functions.Warblish seems at first to be a trivial phenomenon, a clownish verbal play between children or whimsical adults calling out cheeeeeseburger or whip poor will to the birds. Beyond its role as a mnemonic to help people recognize birds by their calls, it is a meaningful biocultural sensory practice that helps train people to listen carefully, make the world “one’s own” and pay careful attention to the ecologies of the other-than-human life around them.In many societies, warblish serves as more than just a mnemonic device for remembering bird vocalizations. Sarvasy outlines several functions and meanings associated with warblish cross-culturally:Heralding seasonal changes, planting/harvesting times Warning humans of approaching people, animals, or spirits Referencing mythology in which people transform into birds Describing observable bird behaviors and routines Facetious or humorous attributions.\n\n\n== Research ==\nAccording to Sarvasy, warblish has been overlooked as a topic of study compared to onomatopoeia and non-vocal mimicry of birdsong. More research is needed into the forms warblish takes across cultures, its functions and meanings, conventionality within speech communities, and how it relates to cultural knowledge of avian ecology and behavior. Cataloging examples of warblish from around the world can provide insights into humans' creative linguistic responses to the natural environment. A recent study has found warblish to widespread across cultures.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPish\nIdeophone\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWarblish Blogsite",

Subsequently, the company has achieved approximately £200 million in annual revenue.\nIts executive director, Jean-Sebastien Pelland, moved to London from Montreal in 2001 as a finance graduate. He took a role at HW Fisher, a chartered accountancy firm, advising the company in its MBO before joining the board in 2008.\nIt has supplied the cables for various major infrastructure projects across the UK, including the electrification of the Great Western Main Line.\nThe company changed its employee remuneration around 2017 due to workforce migration towards Amazon's higher-paying jobs in its South Yorkshire warehouse. In response, the company adjusted its pay structure from the national minimum to a higher living wage, aligning with standards set by the independent Living Wage Foundation. Additionally, it offered a living wage-plus salary, alongside additional benefits such as health insurance coverage for its employees.\nFrom 2020, the company experienced a significant surge in demand and benefitted from private and public sector investment in decarbonisation and digitisation initiatives. In 2022, the company reported a turnover of £200.3 million, a 24% increase from the previous year and a substantial rise from the £107.6 million recorded in 2020. The company attributes this growth to the UK's ambitious efforts to overhaul its energy supply and distribution networks. Additionally, it benefitted from high-growth sectors such as renewable energy, battery storage, mobility and automation.\nEland Cables opened a large cable recycling plant that processes end-of-life cables and their materials. This facility recycles copper, aluminium, and other materials. The recycled materials are used for playground matting. The company recycles its floor sweepings and other site waste and turns non-recyclable materials into biofuel pellets for industrial kilns.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Vicente G. Ericta (February 15, 1915 - February 18, 2007) was a former associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. He was sworn in as a member of the Supreme Court by President Ferdinand Marcos on November 20, 1981, but resigned on May 11, 1982 after being involved in a scandal over the admission of his son as a lawyer, in a case that also saw the resignation of the entire Supreme Court. \n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Laoag, Ilocos Norte on February 15, 1915, Ericta finished his elementary and secondary education in Ilocos Norte. He obtained his pre-law degree and law degree from the University of the Philippines College of Law where he graduated in 1939. He was a classmate of Ferdinand Marcos, who later appointed him to government positions during his presidency.\nDuring the Second World War, he was appointed as military mayor of Laoag. \nEricta's career in the judiciary began in 1946, when he was appointed as Assistant Provincial Fiscal (prosecutor) of Ilocos Norte. He then became a judge in Pagadian, Zamboanga del Sur in 1966 and later held judgeships in Rizal and Quezon City. In 1975, he joined the Court of Appeals as an associate justice before being appointed by President Marcos as Tanodbayan (predecessor of the Ombudsman of the Philippines) in 1979. In 1981, he was appointed as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. At the same time, Ericta also taught law at the Northwestern College of Law in Laoag.\n\n\n== Resignation ==\nEricta's tenure in the Supreme Court was cut short after he was implicated in a scandal over the conduct of the 1981 Philippine Bar Examinations that were overseen by the court. In March 1982, Associate Justice Ameurfina Melencio-Herrera publicly said that the mercantile law grades of Ericta's son Gustavo, who took the examination, was changed from 56 to 58 percent prior to publication of the test results to enable him to pass with a general average of 73 and become a fully-pledged lawyer. Chief Justice Enrique Fernando subsequently admitted ordering the revision in the younger Ericta's grade but denied allegations of unethical behavior, saying that it was done to correct an \"oversight\" by the examiner upon the advice of justices Ramon Aquino and Ramon Fernandez, who were prematurely shown Ericta's grades, and citing a similar predicament with one of his sons, who died shortly after passing the bar exam.\nFollowing public uproar and demands for their impeachment, all 14 members of the Supreme Court, including six justices who were not directly involved in the grade tampering, submitted their resignation to President Marcos on May 11. All of them were subsequently reappointed days later by Marcos, except for Ericta and Fernandez, who were both \"found responsible\" for the scandal by a group of former justices advising the president.\n\n\n== Death ==\nEricta died in 2007.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAssociate Justice Vicente G.

        "content": "Don Johnson (1930 – February 6, 2019) was an American basketball player and coach. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins under head coach John Wooden. As senior, Johnson received honorable mention from United Press International for their All-American team in 1952. He became a junior college coach at Cypress College in Cypress, California, leading the Chargers to a 588–259 record with two state titles and seven conference championships.\nAt the time of his retirement from Cypress, Johnson had the most wins among California junior college men's basketball coaches. He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame, and Cypress dedicated its basketball court \"Don Johnson Court\".\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nAfter graduating from El Monte High School in El Monte, California, Johnson attended Fullerton College from 1948 to 1950, and he was named the Eastern Conference's most valuable player for the 1949–50 season. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins early in coach John Wooden's tenure at the school, about a decade before the coach would win the first of 11 national champitonships.  Replacing graduated star George Stanich at guard, Johnson led the Bruins to two Southern Division championships in the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), and he led the team in rebounding in both of his seasons.\nAs a junior in 1950–51, Johnson averaged 5.2 rebounds per game and received honorable mention for the PCC All-Southern Division team. He averaged 5.8 rebounds in 1951–52, when UCLA won the PCC title and qualified for the 1952 NCAA tournament. He was named a third-team All-American by the Helms Athletic Foundation and earned honorable mention from UPI. He and teammate Jerry Norman, the Bruins' co-captains, were unanimous selections for the PCC All-Southern Division team. In 61 career games, Johnson averaged 9.8 points. His 596 points set a UCLA record for players who only played two seasons, breaking Carl Kraushaar's previous high of 543.\nStanding at 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) and 195 pounds (88 kg), Johnson was among the bigger guards in that era. Wooden said that he \"was a well-rounded basketball player. He played good defense, passed the ball well, could drive to the basket and was a pretty good outside shooter.\" Like a smaller guard, he could bring the ball up, and was also able to defend forwards due to his rebounding ability.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nIn 1954, Johnson became a teacher at El Rancho High School in Pico Rivera, California. As their varsity basketball coach, he led them to the playoffs six times in his 12 seasons. He joined Cypress College when it opened in 1966. He was never attracted to coaching opportunities at four-year colleges, preferring the purer coaching environment of junior colleges.  Johnson led the Chargers to state championships in 1977 and 1980 along with seven conference titles. Seventeen times they won 20 or more games in a season and reached the state semifinals four times.\nJohnson's players included future UCLA and National Basketball Association (NBA) centers Mark Eaton and Swen Nater, neither of whom had much basketball experience before joining Cypress. Afterwards, the school gained a reputation for developing big men. Eaton and Nater both set NBA records. The 7-foot-4-inch (2.24 m) Eaton holds the NBA single-season records for total blocks (456) and blocks per game (5.6) as well as the career record for blocks per game (3.5). The 6-foot-11-inch (2.11 m) Nater is the only player to lead both the American Basketball Association and NBA in rebounding, and he also holds the NBA record for defensive rebounds in a half (18).\nJohnson retired in 1994 after 27 seasons with Cypress, compiling a 588–259 record, at time the most wins by a California junior college men's basketball coach. In 1996, he joined Biola University as an assistant coach under Dave Holmquist, who played for Johnson at Cypress from 1969 to 1971. Johnson remained at Biola until his death in 2019.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nJohnson was inducted into the Orange County Hall of Fame in 1996, the Fullerton College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2010, and the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 2013. Cypress honored him in 2009 by renaming its basketball court \"Don Johnson Court\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJohnson's father, Jack, was a basketball coach at El Monte High. Johnson's mother, Cecile Sparks, played basketball at the University of Kansas for James Naismith, the game's inventor.\nJohnson met his wife, Colette (née Hill), when he was attending Fullerton. They married before his second season at UCLA. They had three children. She worked at the ASUCLA News Bureau while he was playing for the Bruins. She was later as an administrative assistant at Cypress, helping open the school in 1966.\nJohnson died on February 6, 2019, at the age of 88.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCollege stats at Sports-Reference.com",

In its first four kilometers the Hadzhiyska reka flows southwards and then turns east in a wide valley between the Eminska Planina to the north and the Aytoska Planina to the south. Downstream of the village of Galabets its turns southeast, passes through the Poroy Reservoir and flows into the Nesabar Bay of the Black Sea in the southern part of Sunny Beach, the largest seaside resort in Bulgaria, and north of the town of Nesebar. \nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 356 km2. To the north its basin follows the ridge of the Eminska Planina, which separates it from the basin of the river Dvoynitsa. To the south the ridge of the Aytoska Planina forms the boundary with the drainage systems of the Aheloy. The river has predominantly rain feed with high water in February–March and low water in August–September. The average annual flow near the village of Galabets is 0.64 m3/s.\nThe Hadzhiyska reka flows entirely in Burgas Province. There are four villages along its course, Preobrazhentsi and Razhitsa in Ruen Municipality and Stratsin and Galabets in Pomorie Municipality. Its waters are utilised for irrigation.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "content": "The Lopburi tram system (Thai: รถรางลพบุรี) was a transport system in Mueang Lopburi district, Lopburi province, Thailand. It was the only provincial tramway system located outside Bangkok and was operated with electric trams.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lopburi tramway system was built following the plans of then prime minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram to expand Lopburi into a \"military city\" and develop the local transportation infrastructure. Further plans to develop tramway systems in other major cities such as Chiang Mai, Nakhon Ratchasima and Songkhla were also studied, but none were ever constructed. The system was inaugurated by Phibunsongkhram on 31 January 1955 and consisted of a single line, running from San Phra Kan to Erawan Intersection, near the present-day King Narai Hospital. Rolling stock used were disused electric trams from Bangkok's tramway. The opening of the line saw significant usage in its early days and was extended west to Tha Pho Market in the old town area.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nBy 1960, increased bus services in the area, also serving Tha Pho Market and overlapping the tram route meant passenger volumes started to decrease. The scarcity of oil after World War II, meant tram services occasionally had to be suspended, as was the case with some tram lines in Bangkok. This, coupled with the increase in private car ownership in Lopburi meant using trams were slower than going by road, in some cases obstructing traffic as well. After repeated financial losses, the short-lived Lopburi tramway system operated its final services on 1 December 1962.\nAt present, the only tracks in Lopburi remaining are in the U Rotrang Kao (Former Tram Depot) community, located near Erawan Intersection.\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\n\n=== Route Alignment ===\nInitially, the line started behind Si Sunthon Roundabout (San Phra Kan) and ran on Narai Maharat Road until Si Suriyothai Roundabout (Sa Kaeo), where it ran along the outer southern semi-circle curve. The line then continues on Narai Maharat Road, crossing Saphan 7 Bridge and reaching the inner circle of Thep Satri Roundabout (King Narai Monument), running adjacent to Lopburi Provincial Hall. The line then turns northward onto Phahonyothin Road, terminating near the 6th Infantry Battalion Camp (now the 31st Infantry Regiment) at Erawan Intersection where Phahonyothin Road intersects with Highway 3016. This route was approximately 4.8 kilometres (3.0 mi).\nA west extension to Tha Pho Market was constructed not long after the initial line's opening, although it is not recorded exactly when. The line was extended along the northern semi-circle curve of Si Sunthon Roundabout, crossing the State Railway of Thailand's Northern Line, passing in front of Phra Prang Sam Yot on Prang Sam Yot Road. The route then turned northward near Prang Khaek onto Sura Songkhram Road and terminated at Tha Pho Market near the Lopburi City Pillar Shrine. This resulted in a disputed total route length of 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi), or 7.2 kilometres (4.5 mi) according to some sources.\n\n\n=== Ticketing ===\nThe tram line was separated into two ticketing sections, one between Tha Pho Market and Si Suriyothai Roundabout and another between Si Suriyothai Roundabout to Erawan Intersection. Traveling within each section cost 25 satang. Crossing between sections and traveling the entire line cost 40 satang (100 satang = 1 baht).\n\n\n== See also ==\nTransport in Thailand\nTrams in Bangkok\nTrams in Asia\nList of town tramway systems in Asia\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThe article incorporates material from the corresponding article on the Thai Wikipedia.",

He was the founder and first chairman of the Chemistry Department at Colgate University (then Madison University) in 1884.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMcGregory was the son of Joseph and Emeline (Fuller) McGregory. He was educated at Wilbraham Academy. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Delta Upsilon. He received his B.A. degree from Amherst College in 1880 and his M.A. three years later. In 1880–1883 he was an instructor in chemistry at Amherst. In 1905 Amherst awarded him the degree of Doctor of Science. McGregory was called to Colgate, then Madison University, to found the Department of Chemistry and Mineralogy. During the early years of his appointment, he undertook extensive research at the Universities of Göttingen and Heidelberg. He built up the chemistry department at Colgate and expanded it during his years as head. He wrote two textbooks, Qualitative Analysis and Inorganic Chemistry, which were widely used in college courses. \nMcGregory was a fellow of the Chemical Society of London, a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Chemical Society. He was also a member of the German Chemical Society, Alpha Chi Sigma, and the The Chemists' Club.\nIn 1883 McGregory married Emma E. J. Hodgkins. The couple had a son. McGregory died at his home from injuries sustained in a car accident ten days earlier. In 1920 he was seriously injured in an accident on the New York Central Railroad near Schenectady. \n\n\n== Freemasonry ==\nIn addition to his university activities, McGregory was active in civic affairs and was one of the founders of the Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm, an appendant body of Freemasonry. He was the first Grand Alchemist of the order and later served as Grand Monarch. \n\n\n== Writings ==\nMcGregory, Joseph Frank (1903). A Manual of Qualitative Chemical Analysis.

        "content": "The Council House is a former municipal building in Soho Road in Handsworth, West Midlands, a suburb of Birmingham in England. The building, which is currently used as a public library and college campus, is a Grade II listed building.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing significant population growth, largely associated with steam engine manufacturing at Soho Foundry, a local board of health was formed in Handsworth in 1877. The board decided to commission a municipal building for its use. The site selected was on the north side of Soho Road.\nThe foundation stone for the new building was laid on 30 October 1877. It was designed by Alexander & Henman of Stockton-on-Tees in the Gothic Revival style, built in red brick and terracotta at a cost of £20,662 and was completed in 1879. The design involved a main frontage of 16 bays facing onto Soho Road. The left-hand section of five bays formed a public library and the right-hand section of 11 bays formed the council house. The library section, which was asymmetrical, featured a polygon-shaped bay which was projected forward and surmounted by a turret, and there was an arched doorway in the right-hand bay. The council house section, which was broadly symmetrical, featured a five-stage tower in the central bay. There was an arched doorway in the first stage, an oriel window in the second stage, lancet windows in the third and fourth stages, with machicolations above, and a timbered clock in the fifth stage. The central bay was flanked by connecting sections of two bays each and by end sections of three bays each which were slightly projected forward and gabled. The other bays were generally fenestrated with bi-partite or tri-partite mullioned and transomed windows.\nIn 1894, the board was succeeded by Handsworth Urban District Council, which used the Council House as its offices, but the building ceased to be the local seat of government when area was annexed by Birmingham City Council in 1911.\nThe council house was subsequently leased to the Handsworth School of Dress Design, which was a branch of the Birmingham Government School of Design. The Birmingham Government School of Design became part of Birmingham Polytechnic in 1971. In the late 1970s, the vacant building was acquired by Handsworth Technical College (later City College Birmingham), which merged with South Birmingham College to form the Handsworth Campus of South and City College Birmingham in 2012.\n\n\n== References ==",

She explored and studied a variety of art forms, which also included temple murals, as part of her higher studies.\nOne of her paintings titled \"The Royal Procession\" was chosen by the Yugoslav government for Yugoslavia's official postage stamp. Iromie eventually became the first Sri Lankan artist to receive the honour and unique distinction of having his or her painting officially depicted on a foreign stamp. Her painting titled \"Musicians\" was selected as one of the frontrunners to be displayed on the back cover of Reader's Digest magazine in 1999 and it was finalized by the magazine. She became only the third Sri Lankan artist to have had their paintings gracing the back cover of the Reader's Digest magazine after Senaka Senanayake and Raja Segar.\nIn 2006, she was appointed as the chairperson of the jury panel of the Asian Art Biennale in Bangladesh and she was only the second woman to be elected as the chairperson of the jury panel of the Asian Art Biennale. Iromie has served on many distinguished panels such as Ceylon Society of Arts Executive Committee, Painting and Sculpture panel of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka. She was the only Sri Lankan to be invited for the World Art Dubai 2016 event and she displayed one of her paintings in the event. She received the prestigious national honour of Kala Bhushana in 2021 in recognition of her outstanding contributions to the field of arts. In 2016, Sifani Jewellers hosted Iromie along with Raja Segar for a joint exhibition in order to display their distinctly different styles of paintings.\nIn March 2024, she marked her 50 years of painting career by conducting an exhibition titled \"Celebration of women\" at the Harold Peiris Gallery in Colombo and the exhibition portrayed the different phases and trajectory of Iromie in her long journey as an artist. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe also attended her 50 years of painting exhibition.\n\n\n== References ==",

Built exclusively for sale on the domestic Chinese market, the Mix immediately went on sale after its premiere to the public in April 2024 during Auto China.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nIn March 2024, Zeekr presented the first official photos and information about its fifth model, placed in the range below the flagship, luxurious 009 minivan. It took the form of a less squat and more rounded van with a characteristic, single-body silhouette and a relatively large, over 3-meter wheelbase.\nVisually, the Mix recreated the visual features of the 007 sedan presented half a year earlier, with a characteristic large black stripe running across the entire width of the body and front fenders, as well as small headlights integrated with it. The rear part of the body is topped with a high-mounted LED light strip, and access to the extensively glazed body is facilitated by sliding side doors. The body was painted in contrast with the black roof, which included a sunroof. Inside, there are two seat configuration options: 5 or 6. A characteristic detail was the lack of a B-pillar, as well as the ability to turn the second row of seats backwards, providing a spacious space for passengers, amounting to a total of 6.3 square meters.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "KArtu (English: Together), known by the full name KArtu. Left Alliance (Lithuanian: KArtu. Kairiųjų aljansas) is a left-wing political party in Lithuania founded on 1 May 2024. It was originally founded as a non-partisan political movement in 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Left Alliance was founded in 2022 with a manifesto by over twenty political figures, including cultural figures, artists, and members of both the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union. In its manifesto, the Left Alliance claimed that Lithuanian politics lack a \"progressive left-wing party\" and attacked the Social Democrats for insufficient allegiance to their party program and betrayal of left-wing values.\nOne of the founders of the movement, Andrius Bielskis, had been involved in activism for an \"alternative left\" since 2007, in which he was the main ideologue and a founder of the short-lived Naujoji kairė 95 (English: New Left 95).\nIn February 2022, it organized a picket in support of the ongoing strike in the chemical plant Achema. In light of ongoing political discussion regarding the promulgation of same-sex partnerships law in Lithuania, it spoke out in favor of immediate legalization of same-sex partnerships.\nOn 12 January 2024, it became a founding member of the Central-Eastern European Green Left Alliance (CEEGLA) alongside Left Together, Democracy and Solidarity Party, Socialist Alternative Future, Social Movement and the Spark Movement.\nOn 1 May 2024, the party was founded in Vilnius. Jolanta Bielskienė, former member of the Social Democratic Party, was elected as its chairwoman.\n\n\n== Platform ==\n\nKArtu is a left-wing party and presents itself as \"an alternative to the dominant, purely right-wing politics and doctrine of neoliberal capitalism\". It supports shortening the work week, first to 32 hours and later to 28 hours, encouraging the expansion of trade unions, progressive taxes on corporations, businesses and high-income landlords, reducing food prices, regulating the housing market by setting rent caps, and expanding women's rights and LGBT rights in Lithuania. It promotes the creation of economic democracy by promoting worker cooperatives instead of private ownership.\nIt supports Lithuania's membership in NATO and the European Union, and the strengthening of national defense. It supports Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian War and, alongside the Trade Union \"May 1st\", agitates for debt forgiveness to Ukraine, as well as harsher sanctions and support to the labor movement in Ukraine. It condemns Israel's actions against Palestinians and supports a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Santali literature refers to the literary works written in the Santali language, primarily spoken by the Santal people of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is written in the indigenous script called Ol Chiki script.\n\n\n== Historical development ==\n\nThe roots of Santali literature can be traced back to ancient times when it was primarily oral. The Santal community has a rich tradition of oral literature, including folk tales, songs, and myths, passed down through generations. The earliest known written works in Santali date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the efforts of Christian missionaries and Santal intellectuals.\n\n\n== Early influences ==\nThe Christian missionaries played a significant role in the development of written Santali literature. The first book written in Santali, a translation of the Bible, was published in 1895 by Lars Olsen Skrefsrud, a Norwegian missionary. Following this, several other missionaries and Santal scholars contributed to the development of Santali literature.\n\n\n== Literary forms ==\n\nSantali literature encompasses various forms, including poetry, prose, drama, and folk literature. Traditional Santali literature includes a rich collection of folk tales, myths, and legends that have been orally transmitted through generations. These oral traditions continue to influence contemporary Santali literature.\n\n\n== Notable authors and works ==\nPandit Raghunath Murmu (1905–1981) is considered the father of modern Santali literature. He created the Ol Chiki script for writing Santali and wrote the first Santali drama. His most famous work is the \"Bidu Chadan\", a long narrative play.\nHansda Sowvendra Shekhar (born 1983) is a contemporary Santali writer, Shekhar has gained recognition for his works in both Santali and English. His debut novel, \"The Mysterious Ailment of Rupi Baskey\", won the Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar in 2015.\n\n\n== Recognition and impact ==\n\nSantali literature has gained recognition both nationally and internationally. In 2005, the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, included Santali as one of its official languages, providing further recognition to Santali literature and its contributors.\n\n\n== References ==",

He received his early education in Islamic sciences and Arabic literature.\n\n\n== Spiritual life ==\nAbdullah Shah Naqshbandi's spiritual teachings were rooted in the principles of the Naqshbandi Sufi order. His guidance emphasized the importance of inner contemplation, remembrance of God (dhikr), and spiritual connection with the divine. Key aspects of his teachings:\n\nAwareness of Numbers (wuquf adadi): This practice involves a conscious awareness of the number of times one recites a particular dhikr or divine name, fostering focus and mindfulness.\nAwareness of the Heart (wuquf qalbi): It encourages the seeker to maintain a constant state of awareness and presence of heart, especially during the recitation of dhikr.\nSilent Dhikr: Naqshbandi's practice includes silent dhikr, which is the remembrance of God without vocalization, allowing for a deeper internal connection.\nThe ‘Uwaysi’ Transmission of Spiritual Knowledge: This refers to a form of spiritual guidance received not through physical interaction but through a connection in the spiritual realm with past saints and prophets.\nSpiritual Exercises: The Naqshbandi path includes specific spiritual exercises designed to remove the veils between the seeker and their heavenly position, bringing them closer to the Divine Presence.\nThese teachings aim to cultivate a direct and personal experience of the divine, transcending formal rituals and external observances to achieve a state of unity with God. The Naqshbandi way, as taught by Abdullah Shah Naqshbandi, is a path of purification and self-improvement, leading to spiritual enlightenment and closeness to the divine.\n\n\n== Literary works ==\nSome of his notable literary works include:\n\nNoor Ul Masabeeh: This is a comprehensive book on Hanafi Fiqh, which he spent almost 50 years writing. It covers various chapters such as Aqaid, Salah, Zakat, Nikah, etc., and is spread across 12 volumes.\nGulzar E Auliya: This book provides brief accounts of the lives and teachings of Naqshbandi saints.\nFazail E Ramzan: This book discusses the virtues and blessings of Ramadan, along with other spiritual topics.\nZujajat al-Masabih: A unique and comprehensive collection of Hadiths pertaining to the Hanafi school of law, compiled into five volumes.\nThese books continue to be influential in the study of Sufism and Islamic spirituality.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Alnmouth Lifeboat Station is a former Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which was located at the village of Alnmouth, near the town of Alnwick, in the county of Northumberland. \nA lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1854. The station was closed in 1935.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1851, Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland, of Alnwick Castle, had been appointed president of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS). He set a competition for the design of a Self-righting lifeboat, with the reward of £100, which was won by James Beeching of Great Yarmouth.\nBeeching presented a 22-foot version of his boat, named Lucy, to the Duchess of Northumberland, intended for personal use. A boathouse was built on Northumberland's land at Alnmouth, and the boat was delivered in September 1852. However, the boat was then used for lifeboat trials by Capt. John Ross Ward, RN, Inspector of Lifeboats. With a crew of local men, they rowed the boat through the surf, eventually managing to roll the vessel, pitching Capt. Ward into the sea. The  boat performed as designed, righting itself, and Capt. Ward was quickly recovered. Many subsequent lifeboats would follow this design. For his efforts, Capt. Ward was awarded the Silver Medal.\nWith the boat and boathouse already in place, there was effectively a lifeboat station in Alnmouth from 1852. In 1854, the Duke of Northumberland formally transferred the lifeboat and boathouse to the (now renamed) RNLI, thus creating Alnmouth Lifeboat Station. The boat was sent to Forrestt of Limehouse for some modifications, returning in December 1854. A launch carriage was provided in 1856, and a larger boathouse was funded by the Duke and constructed in 1860.\nThree further lifeboats would see service at Alnmouth. In 1865, the RNLI would order a 32-foot 10-oar pulling and sailing lifeboat (one with oars and sails) from Forrestt of Limehouse. A gift of £320 from Miss Wardell of Tunbridge Wells funded the boat, which was transported to Alnwick free of charge by the Great Northern and North Eastern Railway Companies, arriving in March 1865. The boat was named John Atkinson. In 1888, Alnmouth would receive Allen Scott (ON 171), a 34-foot 10-oar Self Righting (P&S) lifeboat costing £329, constructed by Woolfe of Shadwell, and funded from the legacy of Mr T. W. Allen of Newbury, Berkshire. Then in 1909, a 34-foot 10-oar Self-righting Dungeness-class lifeboat constructed by Thames Ironworks, provided by a gift from Miss Maria Mercer of Clayton-le-Moors in Lancashire, and named John and Robert C. Mercer (ON 591).\nAlnmouth lifeboat station was closed in 1935. In 82 years service, the lifeboats would be launched only 19 times, and rescue 15 lives. The John and Robert C. Mercer (ON 591) was transferred to Newburgh, serving a further six years. Both the 1852 and 1860 boathouses remain, and are currently used by the Alnmouth Community Rowing Club.\n\n\n== Alnmouth lifeboats ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Dvoynitsa (Bulgarian: Двойница) is a 52 km long river in eastern Bulgaria that flows into the Black Sea.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe river takes its source under the name Lekarnitsa from a spring at an altitude of 440 m in the Eminska Planina division of the Balkan Mountains. It flows in northern direction in a deep forested valley until the village of Golitsa. It then turns in direction east–southeast for the duration of its remaining course, as it valley widens and divides the Kamchiyska Planina to the north and Eminska Planina to the south. The Dvoynitsa flows into the Black Sea in the northeastern outskirts of the town of Obzor. Due to the small gradient, the river forms many meanders. \nIts drainage basin covers a territory of 479 km2. To the north its basin follows the ridge of the Kamchiyska Planina, which separates it from the neighbouring basins of the Kamchiya and the Fandakliyska reka. To the south the ridge of the Eminska Planina forms the boundary with the drainage systems of the Hadzhiyska reka and several small short rivers that empty into the Black Sea. The Dvoynitsa receives mainly rain feed, which forms 45% of the inflow. The period of high water lasts for four months, during which the average flow is 7 m3/s. It largest tributary is the Velikovska reka (25 km). \n\n\n== Nature ==\nThe river banks are covered with forest vegetation of willows, poplars, elms, ashes, linden, oaks and the rare Oriental beech, often overgrown with climbing vegetation of ivies, leather flowers and Smilax. At places there are reeds and cattails. There is diverse avifauna with at least 50 species only in the river mouth, such as common redshank, common moorhen, common sandpiper, common tern, mallard, great reed warbler, common kingfisher, western yellow wagtail, squacco heron, grey heron, little egret, etc. Local birds of prey include Eurasian sparrowhawk, common buzzard, Eurasian scops owl, tawny owl and little owl. There are fish populations of Eurasian carp, common chub, Romanian barbel, Flathead grey mullet and others, that support the aquatic birds.\n\n\n== Settlements and economy ==\nThe Dvoynitsa flows in Burgas and Varna Provinces and downstream of Golitsa its valley serves as border between the two administrative divisions. There are three settlements along its course, the village of Koznitsa and the town of Obzor in Nesebar Municipality of Burgas Province and village of Popovich in Byala Municipality of Varna Province. Its waters in the middle and lower course are utilised for irrigation, the main crops being barley, maize, peaches, apples, grapes, almonds, lavender. \n\n\n== History ==\nIn the Antiquity the river was crossed by a Roman road that followed the Black Sea Coast linking a road station and castrum at the modern town of Obzor just south of the river to the settlement at Cape St. Athanasius a few kilometers to the north. The castrum at Obzor was abandoned in the 5th–6th century AD. Along the ridge of the Eminska Planina south of the river there were several fortresses that protected the northern border of the Byzantine Empire. In the 13th and 14th century the Bulgarian Empire constructed the important fortress and town of Kozyak on a height over river banks some 3 km upstream from its mouth, which guarded the only road along the coastline. During the Uprising of Ivaylo (1277–1280) Kozyak was temporarily occupied by the Byzantines. In 1366 the fortress was one of the several Bulgarian maritime strongholds captured by Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy during the Savoyard Crusade. It was finally destroyed in the late 14th century during the Bulgarian–Ottoman wars.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==\nМичев (Michev), Николай (Nikolay); Михайлов (Mihaylov), Цветко (Tsvetko); Вапцаров (Vaptsarov), Иван (Ivan); Кираджиев (Kiradzhiev), Светлин (Svetlin) (1980).

        "revision_id": 1222153762,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Skiriotes v. Florida, 313 U.S. 69 (1941), was a Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the states, under the authority of the Tenth Amendment, do have the authority to govern their citizens' conduct in the sea, when not in conflict of federal law. The Appellant in this case challenged his conviction under a Florida law which prohibited citizens from using diving equipment to gather sponges in the Gulf of Mexico or the Straits of Florida. It also further allowed States to have a broad authority in deciding their own maritime boundary, when approved by Congress. \n\n\n== Historical context ==\nThis case begins on March 8, 1938, when Lambris Skiriotes, a resident of Pinellas County, Florida, was spotted using diving equipment two marine leagues (6 miles) off the coast of Pinellas County. The sheriff of the county shortly thereafter went to the Pinellas County Courthouse and requested an arrest warrant against Skiriotes, which was granted and executed. Interestingly, Skiriotes challenged his imprisonment to a United States district court with a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted but reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Cunningham v. Skiriotes, 101 F.2d 635 (1939). \n\nNevertheless, Skiriotes was found guilty of violating the Compiled General Laws of Florida (1927), Section 8087 by Circuit Judge John U. Bird. The criminal statute reads as follows:\"It shall be unlawful for any person, persons, firm or corporation to maintain an'd use for the purpose of catching or taking commercial sponges from the Gulf of Mexico, or the straits of Florida or other waters within the territorial limits of the state of Florida, diving suits, helmets, or other apparatus used by deep sea divers. \nAnyone violating any of the provisions of this section shall be fined in the sum not exceeding five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\"\n\n\n=== Appeal to the Florida Supreme Court ===\nFollowing his conviction, Skiriotes filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida to review his case. On September 6, 1940, Chief Justice William Glenn Terrell, on behalf of Justice Elwyn Thomas, Justice James B. Whitfield, Justice Armstead Brown, Justice Rivers H. Buford, and Justice Roy H. Chapman, wrote the majority opinion of the court, in which it ruled unanimously against him and denied his petition. \n\nThe court reviewed Skiriotes' review which was based on the argument that Florida lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him at any point in the water past one marine league (3 miles) off the coast, seeing as the territorial jurisdiction of the United States only extended that far. He argued that the Florida Constitution approved by the United States Congress in 1885 which set the Florida maritime limit at three marine leagues (9 miles) was contrary to international law, which generally recognized a nation's maritime limit to be one marine league. The Court recognized as such, stating,\"In the absence of affirmative action on this point the Supreme Court of the United States has generally assumed the sovereignty of the State to extend one marine league from shore. This distance was fixed because it was at the time considered to be the range of a cannon shot and that the State should be permitted to protect that distance from its shore.\"Skiriotes further argued that when Congress passed an act readmitting Florida into the Union, although making reference to its 1868 Constitution, did not \"constitute an approval\" of such, and thus did not give Florida the authority to set its maritime boundary at three marine leagues. The Court however, disagreed entirely, ultimately stating, \"[I]t appears that any State by approval of Congress has a right to fix its marine boundaries and that if fixed in reason, such right has never been questioned by Congress by any other nation or citizen thereof...It follows that the western boundary of Florida as defined in its Constitution at three marine leagues from shore is conclusive and being so by the agreed statement of facts, petitioner was guilty of violating Section 8087\"Following the decision, Skiriotes once again sought appellate review, and this time filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n\n== Supreme Court of the United States ==\nThe Supreme Court did grant Skiriotes' petition, and on March 14, 1941, held oral arguments, and handed down its decision on April 28, 1941. Writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes handed down the Court's majority opinion in favor of the State of Florida. \n\nThe Court firstly tackled the international law issue raised by Skiriotes, in which he now opted to raise various constitutional sections, treaties, and correspondence of the United States. The Supreme Court, noting the prior opinion of the Florida Court, cast aside these challenges, stating, \"[N]one of the treaties which appellant cites is applicable to his case. He is not in a position to invoke the rights of other governments or of the nationals of other countries.\"The Supreme Court then further addressed an argument that the Florida law contradicted with a law passed by Congress on the regulation of sponge fishing as well, thereby meaning the Florida law must be void due to the Supremacy Clause. The Supreme Court did an examination of the federal law (16 U.S.C § 781), which states as follows,\"Sec . 2. That the presence of sponges of a diameter of less than five inches on any vessel or boat of the United States engaged in sponging in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico or the Straits of Florida outside of State territorial limits, or the possession of any sponges of less than the said diameter sold or delivered by such vessels, shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this Act. \nSec . 3. That every person, partnership, or association guilty of a violation of this Act shall be liable to a fine of not more than $500, and in addition such fine shall be a lien against the vessel or boat on which the offense is committed, and said vessel or boat shall be seized and proceeded against by process of libel in any court having jurisdiction of the offense.\"The Court reasoned that the Florida law is not in conflict due to the federal statute being \"limited to the particular matter of size\", and that while the Florida law went farther than the federal law, that fact did not mean the laws were in conflict. The Court stated on this point,\n\"According to familiar principles, Congress having occupied but a limited field, the authority of the State to protect its interests by additional or supplementary legislation otherwise valid is not impaired. Reid v. Colorado, 187 U.S. 137 (1902).\" \n\nThe Court having stated this, in essence completely invalidated the argument of Skiriotes, and once again stated the \"appellant has no standing to invoke\" any of the treaties involved or referenced, and subsequently denied the argument of any conflict with federal law. The Court set its final remarks as,\"[T]he State had power to prohibit the described conduct of its citizen at that place, we are not concerned, from the standpoint of the Federal Constitution, with the ruling of the state court as to the extent of territorial waters. The question before us must be considered in the light of the total power the State possesses...we find no ground for holding that the action of the State with respect to appellant transcended the limits of that power.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Physcia magnussonii is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), foliose lichen in the family Physciaceae. It was formally described as a new species in 1952 by the Swiss botanist Eduard Frey. He collected the type specimen in Bern, Switzerland. The species epithet honours the Swedish lichenologist Adolf Hugo Magnusson. Frey's original specimen was later declared the lectotype of the species by Roland Moberg in a 1977 monograph on the genus Physcia.\nPhyscia magnussonii has a heteromerous and dorsiventral thallus with narrow lobes that form tightly packed, circular rosettes. The lichen produces apothecia (fruiting bodies) with club-shaped asci containing eight ascospores, and also produces pycnidia with asexual conidia, with chemical properties including the presence of atranorin.\n\n\n== Description ==\nPhyscia magnussonii is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure. The thallus—the main body of the lichen—is heteromerous and dorsiventral, with narrow lobes that are closely pressed against the substrate. These lobes form tightly packed, circular rosettes that can reach up to 8 cm (3.1 in) in diameter. The lobes themselves are up to 3 mm wide, generally overlap each other, and are slightly convex. The colour of the lobes ranges from whitish grey to brownish grey, and they are uniformly covered with a dense, white powdery coating (pruina). The underside of the thallus is white to brownish, featuring a few thick and simple rhizines, which are root-like structures that help anchor the lichen.\nThe upper layer of the thallus, or cortex, is made of densely packed cells (paraplectenchymatous), while the inner layer, or medulla, is white. Physcia magnussonii commonly produces apothecia (fruiting bodies) that are up to 3 mm across. These have a black disc that is usually white-pruinose and are bordered by a smooth, thallus-like margin. The fruiting bodies contain spore-producing structures called asci, which are club-shaped, very thin-walled, and feature a tall, blue-staining tholus with an indistinct amyloid ring when treated with iodine (K/I+ blue), characteristic of the Lecanora-type asci. Each ascus holds eight ascospores.\nThe spores are one-septate (divided into two cells by an internal partition, or septum), brown, and narrowly ellipsoid, measuring 16–24 by 6–9 µm. They have a unique verrucose (warty) ornamentation and have thickened walls at the apex and septum, typical of the genus Physcia. Pycnidia, small fruiting bodies containing asexual spores (conidia), are also common and appear as immersed black dots. The conidia are almost cylindrical in shape.\nIn terms of chemical properties, the cortex tests K+ (yellow), indicating the presence of atranorin, a common lichen product, whereas other chemical spot tests on the medulla may show negative (K−) or a pale pink reaction (K+ pale pink), with no reaction to other tests: (C−), (KC−), and paraphenylenediamine (P−).\nVariolaric acid is a secondary metabolite (lichen product) that has been shown to occur in some Norwegian specimens of Physcia magnussonii. This rare depsidone substance is know to occur in only a few lichen species, mostly in the order Pertusariales.\n\n\n== Species interactions ==\nZwackhiomyces turcicus is a lichenicolous fungus that was reported growing on the thalli of Physcia magnussonii lichens in southern Turkey. Infection by the commensalistic or weakly parasitic fungus results in slight bleaching on the infected part of the host thallus. The fungus is only know to occur in its type locality in Pinus nigra forest in Gevne Vadisi, Taşkent.\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nPhyscia magnussonii is found in Northern and Central Europe, and Greenland. In North America, its distribution is poorly known, but it has been recorded in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho southwards to Colorado.\n\n\n== References ==",

As of April 2024 he was under investigation by China's top anti-graft watchdog.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLiu was born in Juancheng County, Shandong, in July 1963. In 1980, he enrolled at the College of International Relations (now Chinese People's University of Police Officers), where he majored in English. \n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduating in 1984, Liu was assigned to the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security. He joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in December 1986. He served at the bureau for 20 years, ultimately being appointed director in February 2004. He became director of the International Cooperation Bureau in October 2005, and served until June 2012.  \nIn June 2012, Liu was transferred to northwest China's Qinghai province. He was appointed vice governor of Qinghai, concurrently serving as secretary of the Political and Legal Affairs Commission and head of Qinghai Provincial Public Security Department.\nHe took office as vice minister of justice in January 2016, and held that office until June 2023. \n\n\n== Downfall ==\nOn 30 April 2024, Liu was put under investigation for alleged \"serious violations of discipline and laws\" by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party's internal disciplinary body, and the National Supervisory Commission, the highest anti-corruption agency of China.

She hails from Siddi ethnic community which is the only African tribe in India.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHer talent was spotted through the introduction of the Special Area Games Scheme, which was implemented in the 1980s to include the marginal Siddi community, who would otherwise have been generally excluded from the national sports program in India. She was part of the second batch of the Special Area Games program which was guaranteed to transform the lives of Siddi community. She clinched a gold medal in long jump in the 1991 Inter-Zonal Junior Athletics Championship held in New Delhi.\nShe was chosen to represent India at the 1993 South Asian Games, which were held in Dhaka, and she clinched a bronze medal in the women's 100-meter hurdles event. She also delivered continuous medal success representing India when she claimed three gold medals at the 1993 World Police Fire Games in Melbourne. She was eligible to compete at the 1993 World Police Fire Games after landing a job as a constable with Karnataka Police.\nHowever, her dream to succeed in the field of athletics was only short-lived as the ambitious project of converting Siddi community members into Olympic athletes was scrapped, and it had a negative impact on the livelihood of the Siddi ethnic group. The Special Area Games program was abruptly scrapped in 1995 without any prior announcements and the reason for the termination of the project was not officially revealed.\nShe also secured day job employment opportunity with the regional railways. She currently works as the Chief Superintendent with the South Western Railway.\n\n\n== References ==",

This year there was no championship due to a shortage of teams in both divisions and so there was only a men's Premiership along with, as last year, a Women's Premiership. The season saw last year's Championship winners the Banbridge Broncos win this year's Premiership for the first ever time.\n\n\n== RLI Premiership ==\nSix teams contested the RLI Premiership, \n\n\n=== Teams ===\n\n\n=== Results ===\n\n\n==== Round 1 ====\n\n\n==== Round 2 ====\n\n\n==== Round 3 ====\n\n\n==== Round 4 ====\n\n\n==== Round 5 Magic Weekend ====\n\n\n==== Forefited Games ====\n\nNote forfeited games are marked as a  50-Nil loss per RLI rules.\n\n\n==== Semi Finals ====\n\nLonghorns had their semi-final victory overturned by RLI for fielding ineligible players.

Smith offered the play to JC Williamsons and Bert Bailey who rejected it but the play was popular.\nThe play raised over a thousand pounds for the Red Cross.\nThe Age said \"it is a comedy drama, in which the farce element preponderates, or would do so if the author had- not relied almost exclusively on his dialogue for tlie numerous laughs that encouraged the performers throughout the\nthree acts.\"\nAccording to Table Talk \"As in all his plays, Mr. Smith has conceived a good foundation plot, though some of the methods of working it out are conventional and rather farcical.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Reveille is a 1917 Australian play by Jo Smith. \nIt was called \"a three-act drama which makes An appeal- to the eligible to enlist.\"\nThe original production raised money for the war effort.\nAccording to the Argus the \"serious and comic aspects are well blended.\"\nThe Bulletin said the \"play runs on the safe lines of old domestic  drama as i-egards plot, the Australian interest is sustained, and the war theme brings  \nthe story up to date. It is just the old tale of a hero put in a false position by his desire to shield his girl’s father from an awful disclosure, and when the disclosure is found to be not awful at all the play ends happily. Comedy relief has some snap in it, and the serious lines have literary pretensions. In short, not half a bad play.\"  \nSmith later said he felt \"the strong recruiting flavor of the play would be against it as a commercial proposition.\"\n\n\n== Premise ==\nA farmer tries to persuaide his nephew not to enlist.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sport Clube Castêlo da Maia is a Portuguese football club based in Maia that was founded in 1938. It currently plays in the district leagues of the district of Porto. The highest tier in the Portuguese football league system that it has ever participated in is the 3rd national tier, having participated in it for the last time in the 1999/2000 season. The team plays its matches at Dr. Costa Lima Municipal Stadium. It also competes in women's football.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of forming a club surged due to young people from Castêlo da Maia, Maia meeting up to play football matches. These matches occurred at the Santo Ovídeo park. Armando Nogueira was the organiser of these matches. Sometimes these young people would play against neighbouring teams or woud travel to different places to play against other teams. Gardener Manuel Pereira launched the idea of forming an association, and the club was soon founded afterwards in 1938. A new football pitch began being built in the 1950s called Dr. Costa Lima Municipal Stadium, later being remodeled in the 1970s. In the 1960s the club began having volleyball, however years later a split happened creating the Castêlo da Maia Ginásio Clube.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The 1998 Danish general strike was a general strike in Denmark in the spring of 1998 involving around 500 000 workers, around 10% of the Danish population.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn early 1998, members of the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) agreed on a \"three sixes\" programme, aiming to secure six weeks of paid vacation each year, a six-hour hour working day, and a 6% pay raise. \n\n\n== Strike ==\nIn April 1998, the LO and the Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening announced a new two-year collective bargaining agreement that included only a single extra day of paid vacation per year. When the LO put the agreement to a vote of its members, 55% of the workers voted against it. Subsequently, on the 27th of April, the workers walked out on strike.\nOn 6 May, Danish Prime Minister and leader of the Social Democrats Poul Nyrup Rasmussen stated that the strike was \"irresponsible\" and announced measures to end the strike. The measures ordered workers to end the strike by the 11th of May, made it illegal for the same workers to go on strike again within the next two years, and reduced the amount companies had to pay towards employee pensions. The measures also included two extra paid vacations days for workers who had worked for at least nine months at their workplace as well as two additional days of discounted childcare to workers who had spent at least six months at their workplace. The unions accepted the measures without a members' vote, and the strike came to an end.\n\n\n== Assessement ==\nMargaret Slusher of Swarthmore College's Global Nonviolent Action Database assessed the gains won by the workers as \"very small.\" Sam Lowry of libcom.org stated that the strike \"left workers demands largely unmet.\"\nThe European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions described the strike as \"the key event in Danish industrial relations in 1998,\" attributing the strike to the Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening beginning to break away from the traditional Danish cycle of collective bargaining, motivated by a fear of increased economic competition in a growing economy, whereas the workers expected higher increase in wages and benefits from the economic growth. Some commentators believed the government had acted to try and ensure a \"Yes\" victory in the upcoming 1998 Danish Amsterdam Treaty referendum.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe acceptance of the government's measures to end the strike led to an increase in discontent with trade unions in Denmark. The end of the strike also saw a drop in union members contributions to the Social Democrats.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "33 Immortals is an upcoming action roguelike video game developed and published by Thunder Lotus Games. The game is set to be released for Windows PC and Xbox Series X and Series S through early access in 2024.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n33 Immortals is an action video game played from a top-down perspective. In the game, the player assumes control of a damned soul who must fight through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven as they rebel against a cruel God who banishes them. The game supports 33-player cooperative multiplayer, and each gameplay session, which lasts around 25 minutes, is comparable to raid missions from massively multiplayer online games (MMO).\nPlayers start each session in the \"Dark Forest\", a hub world in which players can select their character archetypes (melee, ranged, support, or tank) before venturing through the Eternal Gate into the battlefield. Players are initially split into teams of six as they explore the map and completes Torture Chambers (described by the team as mini-dungeons). Once a chamber is completed, players will unlock Relics and trigger God's wrath, which causes the entire map to be engulfed in fire. The remaining surviving players are then split into three teams, with each team having one chance to complete \"Ascension Battles\", which unlock Legendary Relics that provide global bonuses to the entire team. The session will then culminate with a boss fight. Enemies placement, gameplay challenges and rewards in each session are randomly generated. The players are then returned to the Dark Forest in which they can change their loadout, discuss with non-playable characters to unlock new weapons, relics and poetic perks, which typically provide stat advantages.\nPlayers can freely customize their playable avatar with various cosmetic items. The game features 14 different weapons inspired by the seven deadly sins and the seven heavenly virtues, and players must collaborate with each other to unleash \"co-op powers\", which are powerful moves that can inflict a large amount of devastating damage to enemies. If a player is defeated, other players can revive them within a set period, though the game has a set difficulty, meaning that players are more likely to complete their objectives and defeat the bosses successfully if all of their teammates survive.\n\n\n== Development ==\n33 Immortals is currently being developed by Thunder Lotus Games, the studio behind Spiritfarer. The setting of the game was inspired by The Divine Comedy, with Dante, Beatrice, Virgil, and Charon all appearing in the game as supporting characters, though their backgrounds were reworked to meet modern values. For instance, Beatrice was reimagined from a guide in Purgatory to the \"leader of the rebellion\", and Virgil becomes a female scholar who is interested in \"science, moral values, and the use of weapons\".\n33 Immortals is Thunder Lotus' first online video game. To meet the challenges of developing an online game, the studio expanded into two parallel development team, and recruited personnel with prior experience working on a multiplayer project. While preparing extensively is essential for players to succeed in raid missions in other MMO games, 33 Immortals was described by the team as a \"pick up and raid\" experience, as the game streamlines the mission process and allows players to jump into action \"as quick and seamless as possible\". While the team initially experimented with having 100 players in a gameplay session, the maximum player count was reduced to 33. According to the team, 33 was chosen because each part of The Divine Comedy has 33 chapters.\nThunder Lotus announced 33 Immortals in June 2023 at the Xbox Games Showcase. The game is set to be released via early access in 2024 for Windows PC and Xbox Series X and Series S.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "content": "The Richmond Theatre was the name of four theatres located in Richmond, Virginia. The first theatre was originally established in 1786 as the Academy of Fine Arts and Sciences of the United States or Quesney's Academy. It was renamed the Richmond Theatre after it came under the management of Thomas Wade West and John Bignall. It was destroyed by fire in 1798. The second Richmond Theatre opened in 1806 on the same site and was destroyed by fire in 1811. The 1811 Richmond Theatre fire is considered a significant disaster in the history of the city, and was described by historian Meredith Henne Baker as \"early America's first great disaster\".\nThe third Richmond Theatre opened in 1819 on a different site. After being remodeled in 1838, the theatre re-opened as the Marshall Theatre. It too was destroyed by fire in 1862. The Marshall Theatre was rebuilt on the same foundation and re-opened in 1863. It was originally called the New Marshall Theatre during construction, but was ultimately branded the New Richmond Theatre soon after it opened. By the time this fourth and final structure was demolished in 1896 it was known as the Richmond Theater. The various theatres known as the Richmond and Marshall theatres, were the leading performance venues in Richmond for the majority of the 19th century.\n\n\n== First Richmond Theatre, originally Quesnay's Academy  (1786-1798) ==\n\nThe first Richmond Theatre was originally intended to be not only a theatre, but a school, museum, and art gallery housed collectively under the name of the Academy of Fine Arts and Sciences of the United States. The idea for this organization originated with the French scholar and soldier Chevalier Alexandre-Marie Quesnay de Beaurepaire who had come to the United States in March 1777 to fight in the American Revolutionary War. Quesnay intended to create an American organization modeled after the French Academy of Sciences (also known as the  National Institute of Sciences and Arts).\nAfter nearly a decade of advocacy by Quesnay, a three and a quarter acre plot of land was purchased for 300 pounds from John Turpin on May 20, 1786, through funds raised through subscription to Quesnay's Academy. This land was located at the brow of Shockoe Hill. At the time, the main road on Shockoe Hill did not extend to the property, and as part of the land sale agreement, Turpin paid for the extension of the road and the creation of Academy Square where Quesnay's Academy was to be constructed. The cornerstone of the building was laid by Richmond's Masonic Lodge No. 13 on June 24, 1786. The building's cornerstone was placed at the Northeast corner of the building. The front of the building was situated on what is now 12th street,  and was located at what is now the intersection of 12th and Broad just north of Capitol Square. The academy was built with a \"barn-like wooden structure\".\n\nQuesnay's Academy (QA) opened on October 10, 1886, in a performance given by the Old American Company of Comedians under the management of Lewis Hallam Jr. and John Henry. Sources vary as to which work was performed on this date, with some sources claiming it was the opera  Poor Soldier and others the play School for Scandal. Regardless, sources agree that the repertoire of Hallam and Henry's season in Richmond included the stage works Poor Soldier, School for Scandal, and Alexander the Great ; or , the Rival Queens.\nQuesnay's dream of an institution mirroring that of the French Academy of Sciences was short lived. Social prejudices against the morality of the theatre made operations of such an institution challenging, and he was forced to publicly make it clear that there was separation between the scholars studying at the QA and the visiting theatre troupes utilizing the QA's theatre. Quesney himself taught dance classes at the academy, but by December 1887 Quesney's Academy ceased operation.\n\nTheatre managers Thomas Wade West and John Bignall took over the QA, and made significant alterations to the QA and its theatre.  It was renamed the Richmond Theatre, and at this time Academy Square became known as Theatre Square. West and Bignall continued to operate the theatre until it was destroyed by fire on 23 January 1798.\nThe Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788 was held in this building beginning on June 2 for three weeks after having begun the convention previously at a structure at Cary and fourteenth streets that was temporarily serving as Virginia's capitol building.  Among the many individuals in attendance were James Madison, John Marshall, James Monroe, Edmund Pendleton, George Wythe, George Nicholas, Edmund Randolph, George Mason, Richard Henry Lee, and Patrick Henry.\n\n\n== Second Richmond Theatre (1806-1811) ==\n\n\n=== Operational and performance history ===\n\nThe second Richmond Theatre was built on the same site as the first theatre, and was erected through the advocacy of John Marshall who was serving as Chief Justice of the United States at the time of the theatre's construction. Through Marshall's efforts, the funds to build this theatre were raised through subscription and construction on the theatre began in 1804. This second theatre was made from brick instead of wood and stood three stories high. It opened on January 25, 1806, and was referred to in the Richmond Enquirer as both the \"New Theatre\" and the \"Richmond Theatre\". It was financially profitable during its five year history. \nThe second Richmond Theatre was initially inhabited by the West and Bignall theatre company. One of the early plays staged at the theatre in 1806 included William Dunlap's english language version of Jean-Henri-Ferdinand Lamartelière's 1799 play  Abelino ou le Grand Bandit (English: Abaellino, the Great Bandit), a work often misattributed to Friedrich Schiller. The theatre was then taken over by a company led by Thomas Abthorpe Cooper whose first appearance in Richmond was in the title role of William Shakespeare's Hamlet in April 1806.  Cooper performed several more parts at the Richmond Theatre in the following months, among them Rolla in August von Kotzebue's The Virgin of the Sun; the gambler Beverly in Edward Moore's The Gamester; Pierre in Thomas Otway's Venice Preserv'd; and the title roles in several more Shakespeare plays, including Othello, Macbeth, and Richard III. \nOther works performed at the Richmond Theatre in 1806 included the plays Speed the Plough (1806) by Thomas Morton, The Irishman in London by William Macready the Elder, The Sailor's Daughter by Richard Cumberland; and the ballad opera The Devil to Pay by Charles Coffey and John Mottley.\n\n\n=== Richmond Theatre fire of 1811 ===\n\nThe Richmond Theatre was destroyed by fire on December 26, 1811 in what historian Meredith Henne Baker described as \"early America's first great disaster\". The fire broke out during a benefit performance held in honor of the French actor Alexander Placide and his daughter, actress Jane Placide. The repertoire for that evening included two full length plays as well as four musical works performed by the theatre's orchestra in-between the plays. The first play was Denis Diderot's comedy Le Père de famille given in an English language translation entitled The Father; or, Family Feuds by Louis Hue Girardin who was then principal of the Hallerian Academy and was formerly a professor of modern languages at the College of William & Mary.\nThe second play given was Matthew Gregory Lewis's melodrama Raymond and Agnes; or, the Bleeding Nun which also incorporated aspects of British pantomime. After the first act of this second play, a chandelier with lit candles was raised by one of the stage hands, and it swung and caught fire to the backdrop which was made of paper. The fire spread the ceiling of the building and set the roof ablaze. Within ten minutes the fire had spread throughout the building. \nThe audience in the Richmond Theatre on the night of the fire totaled more than 600 people, and the building had only three exits, causing congestion as people tried to flee through the theatre's three exits. A minimum of 76 people died in the fire, making it the most deadly urban disaster in the history of the United States up to that point in time. Several prominent Virginia citizens died in the fire, including Virginia's governor George William Smith; former United States Senator Abraham B. Venable; lawyer Benjamin Botts who defended Aaron Burr during his conspiracy trial; and Mary Clay, the daughter of congressman Matthew Clay.\n\n\n== Third Richmond Theatre, also known as Marshall Theatre (1819-1862) ==\n\n\n=== Third Richmond Theatre ===\n\n\n==== Operational history ====\nAfter the devastating 1911 fire, there was tremendous opposition to rebuilding of a theatre in Richmond, and in general there was a wave of opposition against theatrical enteripises that extended across America in the years immediately following that disaster. Construction on a new theatre did not begin until seven years later when Christopher Tompkins was successful at convincing the public to allow him to build a theatre for a stock company. Tompkins sold the property he owned at the  southeast corner lot on Seventh and H (later called Broad) Streets to the English-born actor Joseph George Holman with the intent that Holman would build a theatre for his company on the property. However, Holman died in 1817, the year construction on the theatre began.\nThe building of the third Richmond Theatre was done by what was called \"subscription\", where a group of individuals would invest money in the theatre and essentially own stock in the theatre enterprise. A total of 104 investors, most of them local to Richmond, owned shares in the theatre with approximately $40,000.00 worth of shares sold. Many of them were prominent citizens of Virginia, including Virginia's governor William H. Cabell, justice John Marshall, journalist Thomas Ritchie, and banker James Rawlings (ca. 1788–1838) who was president of the Farmers’ Bank of Virginia. The business side of the theatre was run by a board elected by the shareholders, with Ritchie elected as the board's first chairman. The board was responsible for leasing the building and the initial lessee was the South Carolina composer and theatre manager Charles Gilfert (1787-1829) Gilfert was also an investor in the theatre and was married to actress Amelia Holman Gilfert, the daughter of the aforementioned Joseph George Holman, who had inherited her father's financial investments into the enterprise. She starred in many production at the theatre after it opened in 1819. \n\nThe third Richmond Theatre was a more spacious building than its predecessors, and Gilfert was careful to advertise the many doors extent in the new theatre's design as to make quick exits possible in light of public fears after the 1911 fire. It opened on June 11, 1819. There were still public fears over fire, particularly in regards to a structure next door to the theatre that were viewed by the public as a fire hazard. Accordingly, that property was purchased by the governing board of the Richmond Theatre shortly after it opened, and it was razed in order to alleviate public concerns over another fire. \nGilfert and his company leased the Richmond Theatre for five years. University of North Texas scholar Martin Staples Shockley stated that Gilfert's company was \"perhaps the best [theatre] company in America during that time.\" However, while the quality of productions were high, the theatre failed to turn a profit; partly due to mismanagement and partly due to persistent fears among the public towards attending theatres following the 1911 fire. After Gilfert left in October 1823, the board found it difficult to find a long-term replacement to lease the theatre.  In the succeeding years share prices in the theatre dropped significantly, and the theatre was occupied by a series of traveling theatre companies of lesser quality. The James H. Caldwell company occupied the theatre for a brief season in 1824, and the theatre was mainly inactive after this until 1827. The theatre was used intermittently between 1827-1834 under several different managers.\nDue to the increase of Richmond's population during the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829–1830, the year 1829 was a very busy year at the Richmond Theatre, with three different theatre seasons offered by three different companies in rapid succession; totaling more performances than any other year in Richmond between the years 1826-1845. That same year the theatre underwent some remodeling and repairs. After this, performances tended to be variety theatre presentations, rather than legitimate theatre, and the theatre's use significantly dropped with on average only one month of use per year. The theatre fell into disrepair closed after it was sold in 1938.\n\n\n==== Performance history ====\n\nBetween 1818 and 1838 there were a total of 30 theatre seasons presented at the third Richmond Theatre (RT) by more than ten different professional acting companies. Collectively, these seasons consisted of more than 300 different plays staged across more than 800 performances. The repertoire of these seasons, while a mix of works by both British and American playwrights, tended to emphasize theatrical works imported from England. In addition to the theatre companies, the theatre also had a resident orchestra which was acknowledged as one of the better quality orchestras in America during that period. However, despite the quality of its players, the orchestra's repertoire was criticized for its lack of sophisticated repertoire. An article in the Virginia Patriot stated of the orchestra\"If it is one of the best orchestras in America they are shamefacedly indifferent for their selection and performance, for in place of the divine airs of Handel, Haydn, Mozart, &c I have heard nothing better than a few Waltzes, Marches, Scotch Airs, &c and the same ones repeated night after night.\"\nSeveral of the plays staged at the RT were adapted into English from foreign language plays; often by uncertain authors. For example, Gilfert's first season at the RT in 1819 included a production of The Maid and the Magpie;  a play originally in the French language under the title La Pie voleuse ou la Servante de Palaiseau which was written by Louis-Charles Caigniez. Caigniez's play was first adapted into English as The Maid and the Magpie by English dramatist Samuel James Arnold, and was later adapted again in different English language versions by English playwrights Isaac Pocock and Thomas John Dibdin and by American playwright John Howard Payne. It's therefore uncertain, which of these many English adaptations was utilized by Gilfert and his company at the RT in 1819, although it was most likely by one of the British writers and not Payne.\nOn July 6, 1821 the celebrated English actor Junius Brutus Booth gave his first performance in the United States at the RT in the title role of Shakespeare's Richard III. In 1822 Gilfert's company staged an English language production of German playwright August von Kotzebue's s Die Sonnen-Jungfrau (English: The Virgin of the Sun).  The company could have used any one of multiple extent English language adaptations; including ones by British writers Frederick Reynolds and Anne Plumptre, or one by American playwright William Dunlap.\n\nThe theatre did stage numerous plays by Dunlap during its twenty year history, among them Thirty Years, or The Life of a Gambler, Fraternal Discord, and Dunlap's adaptation of Edward Fitzball's play The flying Dutchman, or, the phantom ship. It's possible that Dunlap's English language adaptation of Kotzebue's 1790 play Menschenhass und Reue, The Stranger; or, Misanthropy and Repentance, was used when it was staged at the theatre. Likewise, Dunlap's Pizarro adapted from Kotzebue's Die Spanier in Peru may have been used, but there were many other English language adaptations of that work known on the American stage of the period that could have also been utilized, among them Richard Brinsley Sheridan's Pizarro.\nIn 1828 the RT staged two plays by Richmond native Stephen T. Mitchell, including The Maid of Missolonghi, which was based on a poem by Lord Byron.\nFuture First Lady of the United States Priscilla Cooper Tyler worked as an actress at the RT prior to her marriage to Robert Tyler, the son of United States president John Tyler. She was a member of the Compact Corps Dramatique stock company which was headlined by her father, the esteemed English actor Thomas Abthorpe Cooper. Before her arrival in Richmond, reviews of her performances had been less than enthusiastic; although reviewers did not review her harshly and were kind if tepid using words like \"promising,\" or \"as yet undeveloped\" in reviewing her work. This was most likely out of respect for her father.  However, her abilities as an actress were much appreciated by the Richmond public and press, and she received very positive reviews, the best of her career, while performing in that city.  \nPriscilla and her father starred in nineteen performances with the Compact Corps Dramatique stock company at the RT from December 7, i836 through April 10, 1837. Their repertoire included John Tobin's The Honey Moon with Priscilla as Juliana and her father as Duke Aranza; Shakespear's Othello with Priscilla as Desdemona and her father in the title role; James Sheridan Knowles's The Hunchback with Priscilla as Julia; Elizabeth Inchbald's Wives as They Were and Maids as They Are with Cooper as Sir William and Priscilla as Miss Dorillon; and Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing with Priscilla as Beatrice and her father as Benedict.\n\n\n=== Marshall Theatre ===\n\nBy 1838 the third Richmond Theaatre had fallen into serious disrepair and the theatre was closed after being sold to Major S. Meyers. It went under significant alterations and renovations, and it re-opened as the Marshall Theatre on November 14, 1838.  It was named after justice John Marshall. While the theatre's first few seasons offered dramas and sophisticated music, the economic depression of the 1840s following the Panic of 1837 ultimately led to abandoning more elaborate staged productions, and the theatre was used as a venue for traveling minstrels and variety acts of a novel nature. \nOnce the economy had sufficiently recovered, a permanent stock company was established at the theatre in 1845; although it was not consistently profitable until the 1850s. Ethelbert A. Marshall (more commonly know as E. A. Marshall) was head of the stock company from 1847-1849, and his company included the actors Charles Burke (1822-1854) and George Jordan. In 1850 the theatre was one of the stops for the famous soprano Jenny Lind, popularly referred to as the \"Swedish Nightingale\". \nIn 1854 the theatre staged an adaptation of the pro-slavery novel The Cabin and Parlor; or, Slaves and Masters by Charles Jacobs Peterson; a work written in response to the anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin which was later revived at the theatre in February 1861. The work was highly political and was a tool of propaganda to bolster Southern national identity in the years leading up to Secession in the United States. This was just one example of a genre of Southern play which used themes of \"white supremacy\" and \"Northern villiany\" to promote Southern nationalism.\nIn May 1855 the Marshall Theatre was purchased by Elizabeth McGill. In 1856 the theatre's management was taken over by the team of George Kunkel (1821-1885), Thomas L. Moxley (1833–1910), and John T. Ford, the latter of whom founded the Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Ford left the partnership a few years in, but Kunkel and Moxley remained in charge of theatre until the Spring of 1861. The team of Kunkel, Mullenix, and Ford had previous experience in entertainment but were inexperienced in staging serious dramas. To mitigate their lack of knowledge, they hired the actor Joseph Jefferson to be their stage manager who served in that role in the 1856-1857 season. Jefferson was successful in raising the quality of productions at the Marshall Theatre, and was able to bring several well known American actors to the Richmond stage, including the actress Charlotte Cushman and actor Edwin Forrest.\n\nPrior to the 1850s, American theatre was dominated by celebrity actors from Europe. Theatre historians refer to the 1850s as \"America's age of actors\" because it was the beginning of a period when American born actors experienced a surge of popularity among the American public. The Marshall Theatre during this period staged works starring several well known American actors of the period, including brothers Edwin and John Wilkes Booth, and John Drew, as well as the aforementioned actors Cushman and Forrest. \nJohn Wilkes Booth, who later achieved notoriety for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, joined the permanent company of players at the Marshall Theatre in 1858, and remained until 1860 when he began a national tour. He had a particular triumph at the theatre as Shakespeare's Richard III. His brother Edwin, who was nearly five years older, had been performing on the Marshall stage since 1856; often playing the title roles in tragedies like Richard III, Richelieu, King Lear and Henry V. ogether, the Booth brothers starred in several Shakespeare plays at the Marshall Theatre, among them Hamlet with Edwin in the title role and John Wilkes as Horatio. Richmond based sculptor Edward Virginius Valentine was a friend of the Booth brothers, and made a bust of Edwin Booth from life during the 1858 theatre season.\nThe actors John Brougham and William Evans Burton toured to the theatre in February 1858 where they performed a highly modified version of The Merry Wives of Windsor billed as \"Shakespeare's corrected comedy\" with Burton as Falstaff and Brougham as 'The Host of the Garter'. \nComposer and playwright John Hill Hewitt became manager of the theatre in October 1861. The first play he staged at the theatre was James Planché's The Loan of a Lover on November 2, 1861. Just a two months later the theatre was destroyed by fire on January 2, 1862. The fire broke out in the theatre on the morning of January 2 and spread to several of the surrounding businesses and houses, many of which were also destroyed. Hewitt and the actor Richard D'Orsey Ogden were both asleep in the theatre when the fire broke out, and while both managed to escape with their lives, they both suffered severe burns. \nAfter the fire, Hewitt's company remained active in alternative locations in Richmond until a new theatre was built. The troupe had lost all of their music instruments, costumes, sets, and sheet music in the fire; and their ability to quickly shift to a new venue and continue performing was a testament to their resilience. The actor Ben DeBar and his wife were actors in Hewitt's troupe at the time of the fire.\n\n\n== New Richmond Theatre, also known as New Marshall Theatre and Richmond Theater (1863-1896) ==\n\n\n=== Construction and opening ===\nAfter the Marshall Theatre's destruction by fire in 1862, the theatre was rebuilt later that year on the same site at 7th and Broad streets by contractors Joseph Hall and John F. Regnault at a cost of $75,000. The materials to build the theatre had to pass through the Union blockade during the American Civil War. Called the New Marshall Theatre during construction, it was referred to as simply the Marshall Theatre in the Richmond Dispatch when it opened with a production of Shakespeare's As You Like It on February 9, 1863. However, later in the week, advertisements for that production began calling the theatre the New Richmond Theatre. Eventually the theatre became known as the Richmond Theater, its name at the time it closed 33 years later.\n\nWhen the New Richmond Theatre opened, Confederate Civil War general Joseph E. Johnston described the filled to capacity theatre as full of \"government clerks, soldiers, speculators, and hangers-on of every description\" who were seeking \"elegance and comfort in the Confederacy\". The theatre's inauguration also featured the announcement of the winner of a poetry competition whose prize money was the substantial sum of $300.00 (equivalent to over $9,000.00 in 2024). Entries were submitted before the theatre opened, and the winner was announced at the theatre's opening night. Poet Henry Timrod was awarded the prize, and the actor Walter Keeble read his poem, \"Laureate of the Confederacy\", which included the following stanza:\n\n\"Shut for one happy evening from the flood That roars around us, here you may behold—As if a desert way\nCould blossom and unfoldA garden fresh with May—Substantialized in breathing flesh and bloody Souls that upon the poet's page Have lived from age to ageAnd yet have never donned this mortalclay.\"\n\n\n=== Confederate cultural center ===\n\n\n==== Overview ====\n\nThe New Richmond Theatre (NRT) remained busy throughout the American Civil War, and became a cultural center for the Confederate south. More than 400 different plays were staged at the theatre during the civil war; among which were roughly 60 new works. The theatre scene in Richmond was bolstered during this time by those wishing to demonstrate the intellectual adeptness of Confederate society while simultaneously being challenged by those who perceived the theatre to be an immoral institution. Theatre historian Elizabeth Reitz Mullenix stated the following: \"Analysis of theatre during the Civil War is crucial, for it represented a shift of national expressions of culture. Richmond's values, along with those of the entire South, changed dramatically because of sectional crisis, and the theatre both influenced the construction—and reflected the transformation—of this national identity.\"\nTheatre entertainment was viewed as an essential support for the Southern war effort, and well-known actors, musicians, and other entertainers were exempt from conscription until nearly the end of the war. War weary soldiers as well as the general public came to the theatre as a place of escape as well as entertainment. Rather than see a decline in theatre attendance, the war years in Richmond saw a significant increase in the demand for the theatre entertainments among a rising population due to war activity. The population of Richmond more than quadrupled in size during the war, creating a need to increase the number of performances at existing theaters and to create more entertainment venues to meet a surging demand.\nThe owner of the NRT was Mrs. Elizabeth McGill, and Hewitt was the first theatrical manager at the theater. McGill and Hewitt did not get along well, and she fired him in June 1862. Richard D'Orsey Ogden replaced him as manager, and C. A Rosenberg was hired as the theater's musical director at the same time. Among the leading actors in the NRT's company were Harry Macarthy, Edmund R. Dalton, Theo Hamilton, Walter Keeble, and Charles Morton. Leading actresses of the company included Clementine Debar Booth, sisters Ella and Eliza Wren, Eloise Bridges, Ida Vernon, and Lucille Weston.\n\n\n==== Repertoire ====\n\nOgden frequently programmed plays by Shakespeare, using versions originally crafted by David Garrick that had been further modified by John Philip Kemble. Ogden himself made additional changes to these versions of Shakespeare's plays. Macbeth was the most frequently performed work during his tenure but the company also performed other tragedies like Julius Caesar and King Lear and comedies like The Taming of the Shrew. Some of the other plays in the company's repertoire during the war years included John Maddison Morton's Box and Cox, John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi, Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer, Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The Rivals, and multiple plays by writers Dion Boucicault, Augustin Daly, James Planché, Charles Selby, Eugène Scribe, Charles W. Taylor, and Tom Taylor. Particularly popular with Richmond audiences with Douglas Jerrold's Black-Eyed Susan. The company also staged plays based on novels by Alexander Dumas, Walter Scott, and Ellen Wood. \nOriginal works staged the NRT during the civil war were by theme war plays. They all had similar components that included making the hero of the work a young Southern cavalier or plantation owner, and casting Northern gentleman of similar social standing as the Union villain. Other characters that appeared in these Confederate melodramas included a portrayal of the virtues of southern womanhood through the character of the cavalier's wife or betrothed, and a faithful servant or slave who was gifted at minstrelsy. John Hill Hewitt penned the first of these Confederate war dramas, The Scouts; or. The Plains of Manassas, which was used to nostalgize the Antebellum South and promote Southern national identity; an ideology necessary for the Confederate States of America's success.  Well received, it was one of the few Confederate war plays that has survived, with most of the other plays of this genre only being known through newspaper accounts.\n\nHewitt created over a dozen more original war plays, among them The Log Fort; or. Woman's Heroism, The Prisoner of Monterey; or. The Secret Panel, The Scouts; or. The Plains of Manassas, and The Vivandière. Hewitt's large output of plays and songs during the war earned him the moniker \"Bard of the Confederacy\". He stated the following about his work writing plays for the NRT during the war:  \"Military dramas, suiting the pulse of a military audience, proved a great feature. They were all replete with the most gushing patriotism.\"\nIn terms of quality, the most successful war play staged at the NRT was James D. McCabe's The Guerrillas, which had its premiere at different threatre in Richmond, the Richmond Varieties, on December 22, 1862. Highly popular with Richmond audiences, it was first staged at the NRT on May 26, 1863. The play was set during the American Revolutionary War and followed the experiences of three generations of the same Virginia family during those events. The play sharply criticized the Northern United States; emphasizing its brutality. It too has survived.\nThe greatest popular success at the NRT was the war musical The Virginia Cavalier (1863) which used lyrics by George W. Alexander, Commandant of the Castle Thunder Confederate prison. Also a surviving play, the work was largely a knock-off of the earlier The Guerrilas, containing an almost identical plot. It starred the actress and singer Sallie Partington who was one of the performers who starred in the  New Richmond Theatre's inauguaral production of As You Like It. Her performance in The Virginia Cavalier popularized the song \"The Southern Soldier Boy\", and it was published by George Dunn in 1863. Other original Confederate plays that premiered at the NRT included J.J. Delchamp's  Love's ambuscade ; or The sergeant's stratagem; and the anonymous farce Great Expectations; or. Getting Promoted. The latter work was a searing critique of corruption among Confederate quartermasters. \n\nAlso popular at the theatre was the songwriter and showman Harry McCarthy who specialized in comedic impersonations as well as singing his original tunes. He presented his Personation Concerts at the New Richmond Theatre not long after it opened, and his song \"The Bonnie Blue Flag\", which he performed with his partner, the actress Lottie Estelle, was a tremendous hit.\n\nAs the war progressed, maintaining a roster of high caliber talent proved to be difficult, and the quality of productions suffered as a result. The NRT increasingly moved away from serious dramatic repertoire and more towards sensational works of lesser quality; largely to the meet the tastes of the general populace in order to maintain robust ticket sales. Critics in local papers did not hold back in responding with sharp negative reviews to the lowering standards of the theatre. One particularly controversial play which was both reviled and praised by different writers in Richmond newspapers was the play Angel of Death which premiered on December 12, 1863. Some writers accused it of blasphemy for its depictions of Biblical subjects in a secular and scandalous fashion, and others derided it for its horrible literary craftsmanship. One paper attacked the play for the clothing of the actresses playing the angel which was sexually charged and described as a \"flesh costume\" which \"began too late and left off too soon\". Yet, other papers gave high critical praise to the work. The Magnolia wrote the following in its review: \"All the striking and attractive features claimed for it by the management have been fully realized in the representation; and by universal acknowledgement it is one of the most remarkable creations upon the modern stage. No spectacular Drama that we have ever seen, approaches the Angel of Death, in its features of scenery, situation, and poetical imagery.\"\nThe controversy surrounding the Angel of Death made it appealing to curious audiences, and was an example of how the NRT used sensation to keep audiences coming back to its theatre.\n\n\n==== Wartime challenges ====\nThe NRT continued to operate without interruption through the first part of 1864. For a period of several months plays ceased after of a production of  The Ghost of the Dismal Swamp which was presented in May 1864 just prior to the Richmond–Petersburg campaign.  At this point in time the practice of exempting actors from conscription ended. Ogden himself was arrested for avoiding conscription in October 1864 and was put into the Castle Thunder prison; ultimately being sentenced to three months of hard labor on December 29, 1864. After Ogden's arrest Edmund R. Dalton succeeded him as the NRT's manager for a brief period before the owner, Mrs. McGill, ultimately ended up managing the theatre herself. \nWhile the military threat to Richmond and subscription effectively put an end to the staging of plays for a period in 1864, it did not shut down the theatres. Other types of entertainment continued to appear on the NRT stage, including variety and minstrel shows. The NRT resumed staging plays in October 1864 with a production of Po-Ca-Hon-Tas. Women increasingly took on roles traditionally played by men, as the number of male actors in the company shrank to nearly nothing due to conscription. The theatre maintained a busy schedule, playing to packed houses even as Richmond's situation became increasingly dire due to the military blockade. Three new plays to the NRT's repertoire were added in March 1865: Planché's Nell Gwynn, William Henry Oxberry's Norma, and Daniel Auber's opera, Fra Diavolo. Norma was performed at the theatre on April 1, 1865. At the time of the Richmond's surrender on April 2, 1865 the theatre was then occupied by \"Budd and Buckley's Minstrels and Brass Band\".\n\n\n=== Reconstruction Era ===\n\n\n==== Post-war 1860s ====\n\nThe New Richmond Theatre remained under Ogden's management through November 1867. It was the site of the founding convention of the Conservative Party of Virginia which began on December 11, 1867. \nIn January- February 1868 the NRT was leased to John Brougham who began a short season at the theatre starring in his own play The Lottery of Life. Later in February 1868 the theatre was briefly leased to the actress Emily Eliza Saunders, known as Lady Don, who was married to Sir William Don, 7th Baronet. She starred in the plays Kenilworth and the Pretty Horsebreaker, Henry Thornton Craven's Meg's Diversions, and Orpheus and Eurydice.  In June 1868 the theatre was leased to the Excelsior Dramatic Association. In September 1868 a lecture entitled “The Humors of Reconstruction” was given at the theatre by James P. Cowardin. Cowardin was the son of a powerful newspaper publisher in Richmond and used this lecture to lampoon the political conflict between politicians Thomas Bayne and Joseph R. Holmes. The repertory company of the Holliday Street Theater in Baltimore toured to the theatre for performance in October 1868. A company led by actress Laura Keene occupied the theatre in December 1868.\nThe Richmond Musical Benevolent Association leased the theatre in January 1869 for performances of Haydn's oratorio The Creation, and a concert of opera excerpts that included music from Don Giovanni, Il trovatore, La traviata, and The Ring Cycle. In February 1869 the theatre was host to LaRue's Minstrels, and also presented concerts starring the Norwegian violinist Ole Bull. In March 1869 the theatre presented a series of German language operas starring Marie Frederici, including The Magic Flute, Der Freischütz, and Martha. In late March and early April 1869 the theatre held performances by the Hanlon Brothers acrobatic troupe, \nAs of April 5, 1869, advertisements for the Richmond Theatre listed John T. Ford as the lessee and manager of the theatre; beginning with a season of plays starring the comedian Charles B. Bishop and sisters Ella and Blanche Chapman. Some of the plays staged under his leadership in 1869 included F. C. Burnand's Ixion, and John Beer Johnstone's Ben Bolt,  In September 1869 the theatre was presenting performances by Skiff & Gaylord's Minstrels; a minstrel show founded in Philadelphia and financially backed by Coal Oil Johnny. \nThe theatre was sold by auction to an Elizabeth Magill from the state of New York on October 28, 1869. Ford was still listed as a the leasee of the theatre a month later.\n\n\n==== 1870s ====\n\n\n==== 1880s ====\n\n\n==== 1890s ====\nThe theater closed in March 1895, and was sold by Col. John Murphy to a clothing manufacturer in February 1896.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAbel, E.

After attending University College, London he was articled to Arthur William Blomfield in January 1882, qualifying as an architect in 1889 and was elected as an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects that year. During his apprenticeship Atkinson had worked as an assistant to Blomfield, who had been clerk of works on several church restoration projects. After attending the British School at Athens, Atkinson established a practice in Cambridge with C.W. Long. \nHe was appointed Surveyor to the Dean and Chapter of Ely Cathedral in 1906, a post he held until 1920: He had accepted the post of Architectural Surveyor to the Dean and Chapter of Winchester Cathedral in 1919, and relinquished the Ely post when it became clear he could not fulfil both roles.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Miguel Transfiguraçaõ de Cristo \"Michael\" Rodrigues (born 6 August 1947), known professionally as Mike Mehta, is an Indian former advocate, criminal lawyer, actor, playwright, and theatre director known for his work in Hindi, Konkani films, television, and tiatr productions. He provided legal counsel to two Goan politicians, Francisco Monte Cruz and Churchill Alemao, who served as ministers and represented the Benaulim Assembly constituency in the state of Goa.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMiguel Transfiguraçaõ de Cristo Rodrigues was born on 6 August 1947, in Borim, Goa, which was a part of Portuguese India during the era of the Portuguese Empire. He was born into a Goan Catholic family, with his father being José Pascoal Rodrigues and his mother being Cristalina Dias, a homemaker, also known as Cristalina Luis. Rodrigues showcased his talents during his school years by actively participating in English-language concerts and theatrical productions. His proficiency in English and his strong, powerful voice propelled him towards a career as a professional compere, showcasing his talents in hosting events and engaging audiences. Rodrigues gained recognition for his role as a host for various events including weddings, social gatherings, public assemblies, and musical performances. Despite his achievements in this field, Rodrigues experienced a sense of discontentment and yearned for greater fulfillment in his work. In his quest for artistic satisfaction, he immersed himself in the local tiatr scene, regularly attending performances and closely observing the skills and techniques employed by accomplished tiatrists.\nRodrigues achieved recognition performing under the pseudonym Mike Mehta during his participation in English concert showcases. He received his formal education at notable institutions, including St. Michael's High School in Mahim, Bombay, followed by St. Aloysius High School in Bandra and Guardian Angel High School in Sanvordem, Goa. Continuing his academic pursuits, Rodrigues pursued higher education at Parvatibai Chowgule College in Goa and Kirti M. Doongursee College in Dadar. His educational endeavors culminated in the attainment of a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Bombay. During his educational journey from school to college, Rodrigues actively engaged in a variety of English concerts, occasionally expanding his repertoire to include performances in Hindi as well. Despite his proficiency in the Konkani language, he did not have the opportunity to showcase his talents in Konkani concerts, even during his tenure at Guardian Angel High School and Chowgule College in Goa.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRodrigues was a playwright and performer whose socio-political plays, such as Grant Road, Goenkaranchem Rogot (Goans' Blood), and Goem Viklem Ghanttar, hold a significant place in Konkani theatrical history. In his later years, Rodrigues's affection for the Konkani language inspired him to engage in the creation, direction, and acting in tiatrs, which are traditional Konkani musical dramas. Throughout his career, Rodrigues pondered the question of why Bengali literary figure Rabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his Bengali work Gitanjali, while Konkani writers had not received similar recognition. This contemplation became a driving force behind Rodrigues's decision to explore complex and challenging subjects in his Konkani tiatrs, believing that dedication and sincerity could lead to comparable achievements. However, despite his commitment, Rodrigues has yet to receive any awards for his work, resulting in his relative anonymity as a tiatrist, as noted by writer Fausto V. Da Costa. Rodrigues has made a significant impact on the heritage of Konkani tiatr. Over a period of 35 years, he engaged in more than 550 theater performances, demonstrating his proficiency and experience. Furthermore, Rodrigues holds educational achievements in theater and screenplay composition, enhancing his standing in the field. It was Rosario Dias who first introduced Rodrigues to the tiatr stage, casting him in the production Vivasghat (Betrayal).\nIn 1980, Rodrigues gained acclaim for his role in the successful Konkani play titled Purtugez Kolvont (Portuguese Artist), written by Konkani playwright John Claro. This play achieved a significant milestone by staging over 200 performances in locations such as Goa, Bombay, and Poona. Subsequently, Rodrigues was cast in another play by Claro called Inglez Madam (English Madam). Throughout his career, Rodrigues collaborated with popular Konkani directors in the tiatr stage, including M. Boyer, C. Alvares, Jacinto Vaz, Remmie Colaço, Kamat de Assolna, Premanand Sangodkar, Anil Kumar, Fr. Planton Faria, and others. Rodrigues, known for his adherence to the acting principles of \"Konstantin Stanislavski's\" school of acting, showcased his versatility as a writer, director, and producer, contributing to the creation of eleven tiatrs. His significant contributions to Goan theatre primarily revolve around socio-political themes. Examples of his theatrical works include Politik (which delves into the depiction of the Indian Emergency), O Papagaiyo, Canta E Beira (exploring the concept of Goan identity), Goenkaranchem Rogot (advocating for the official recognition of the Konkani language and its placement within the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.), Goem Viklem Ghanttar (highlighting the issue of political defections), and Goem Tum Roddo Naka (emphasizing the importance of preserving tenanted lands and discouraging their conversion for building constructions).\nRodrigues has created several successful tiatrs, including Grant Road, Pavl Mhojem Chuklem, Sunita, and Rostadak Ostad. An acclaimed piece of his repertoire is Pavl Mhojem Chuklem, crafted in 1980 and later transformed into a published work by Om Connie Publication in 2003. Grant Road, staged in 1982, was a production that tackled an unconventional topic within the tiatr sphere. The performance featured the musical abilities of a band led by Konkani musician Chris Perry and included standout performances by Anil Kumar, Betty Ferns, Fatima D'Souza, Kamat de Assolna, Rodrigues in a leading role, and Jacinto Vaz in a comedic character. In addition to his contributions to tiatr, Rodrigues has ventured into other creative endeavors. He has contributed to the production of two Konkani films, written four teleplays, and has showcased his acting talent in both Konkani and Hindi cinema. He played a crucial part in the Konkani movie Girestkai, directed by Konkani filmmaker M. S. Das. Rodrigues has also been featured in Bollywood, such as in the film Doli Saja Ke Rakhna, alongside Akshaye Khanna, under co-producer Rajkumar Santoshi. Rodrigues has consistently pushed the boundaries of the tiatr genre, always striving for innovation and progress. He firmly believed that a tiatr's popularity did not necessarily indicate its progressive nature, advocating for the pursuit of experimentation as the true path to advancement. In his role as a director, he undertook various innovative endeavors in script development, direction, and presentation within the realm of tiatr performances. His contributions to the evolution of tiatr have left a lasting impact, introducing new trends and shaping the future of this theatrical form.\nRodrigues held a strong affinity for the Konkani stage, although he often juxtaposed it with theatrical productions in other regional languages and English theater. In his discerning evaluation, he ascertained that the Konkani stage significantly trailed behind its counterparts in terms of artistic prowess and overall theatrical caliber. Prior to finding his breakthrough, Rodrigues nurtured a strong determination to effect positive change within the realm of Konkani theater. However, he was faced with the predicament of lacking personal acquaintance with any professional tiatrists, which posed a formidable challenge to the realization of his ambitions. During his formative years, a propitious opportunity presented itself when Rodrigues crossed paths with John Claro, a seasoned and educated playwright in the tiatr field. Claro, engrossed in the composition of his tiatr titled Purtugez Kolvont, proffered sagacious counsel to Rodrigues, guiding him to prioritize building a strong stage presence and creating a lasting impression before venturing into initiatives aimed at advancing the tiatr art form. Fortuitously, Claro extended an invitation to Rodrigues to assume a minor role in Purtugez Kolvont, a performance in which Rodrigues delivered a memorable portrayal, garnering acclaim from audiences who were captivated by his talent. To Rodrigues' good fortune, Purtugez Kolvont enjoyed success, amassing almost 200 sold-out performances across various venues. This unprecedented triumph not only amplified Rodrigues' visibility but also conferred upon him the stature of a rising star. Consequently, several directors sought Rodrigues' acting abilities, offering him enticing opportunities to collaborate. As Rodrigues' reputation burgeoned, he steadily ascended fame, carving a prominent niche for himself within the realm of Konkani theater.\nAuthor Wilson Mazarello writes, \"tiatr performances featuring Rodrigues showcased his meticulous approach, characterized by thorough role study and a commitment to delivering memorable portrayals. As his stage presence grew stronger, Rodrigues undertook the task of composing original tiatrs, each showcasing distinctive and inventive features. He employed stage settings and lighting arrangements to enhance his work. With comprehensive storytelling and engaging dialogue, combined with his adept direction, Rodrigues breathed new life into the Konkani stage\", writes Mazarello. Popular among Rodrigues's repertoire were acclaimed tiatrs such as O Papagaiyo, Canta E Beira, Hello Daddy, Pavl Mhojem Chuklem, Grant Road, and Dolle Dampchea Adim (Before you close your eyes), all of which garnered audience appreciation. Grant Road enjoyed the distinction of playing to packed houses in Bombay and even attracted consideration for adaptation into a feature film during the mid-1990s. Rodrigues also explored the realm of video filmmaking, producing adaptations of some of his scripts. During the 1990s, he harbored aspirations for the progression of the Konkani stage. In addition to his accomplishments as an actor and playwright, Rodrigues took on character roles for Konkani directors such as M. Boyer, Remmie Colaço, Aristides Dias, and John Claro. His multifaceted contributions further enriched the theatrical landscape.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRodrigues was a legal professional specializing in advocacy and criminal law, practicing in Margao, Goa. Despite his legal background, he actively embraced the title of \"tiatrist\" and took pride in his association with the Konkani language and the Konkani stage. In 1995, Rodrigues resided with his family in Maddel, Margao. Despite his significant contributions to the Konkani theatre scene, he did not receive any formal recognition or awards for his work, leading to speculation about his standing within the tiatr fraternity. This speculation was further explored in an article titled \"Has the Tiatr Fraternity Disowned Mike Mehta?\" written by fellow Goan writer Fausto V. Da Costa and published in The Goan Review in September 2023. \nRodrigues distinguished himself as the only legal practitioner hailing from the village of Borim, where he excelled in his senior role as a criminal lawyer. After suffering a minor heart attack in 2014, he made the decision to retire from both his legal profession and his engagement in tiatrs. As of 2023, he resides in Pedda, Margao. Rodrigues shares a familial connection with Jose Rod, a Konkani singer and actor, as they are first cousins once removed through Rodrigues' father's brother. Rodrigues is married to Elsie Rodrigues, and their only son, Stanley, has followed in his footsteps and currently practices law at the High Court of Bombay in Goa.\n\n\n=== 2018 physical assault ===\nOn 27 June 2018, an incident occurred involving Rodrigues and his wife, Elsie, who were subjected to an assault by an individual residing in the Fatorda-Margao locality named Madel. The incident, recorded as a criminal case at the Fatorda police station, consisted of Gaspar Fernandes, a person living in the Mahanagar Housing Complex in Madel confronted Elsie with a threat as she was entering a residence within the same complex. Following the initial threat, the individual unlawfully entered the Rodrigues' apartment and physically attacked both Elsie and Rodrigues, causing injuries to Rodrigues as well. In response to a formal complaint lodged by Elsie, legal charges were filed against the accused.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Deramore Arms is a pub in Heslington, York, England.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere were three alehouses in Heslington, but by 1823 there were only two. At this time the pub was called The Ship. In 1840, it was called The Fox. By 1872 it was called The Yarburgh Arms, which in 1967 was updated to The Deramore Arms.\nDuring the Second World War, the pub was popular with Royal Air Force Bomber Command personnel stationed near by. On some occasions, the personnel held races between the Charles and the Deramore on top of a stuffed rhinoceros.\nWhen the University of York opened in 1963, the pub proved popular with students. It was initially the haunt of athletic students. In more recent years, the Deramore has been seen as the 'local' pub, while the Charles caters to the students, although there is considerable crossover between them. The popularity with sports teams university sports teams has remained, with Heslington Parish Council celebrating it as the traditional location for the teams to congregate after matches, and for their pub crawls to begin from. The pub has also proved to be a popular location for attendees of conferences at the university, and an important location for academics at the university to develop their work.\nThe pub has seen friction between students and locals. An attempt by The Spirit Group, the then owner of the pub, to extend opening hours in 2005 was successfully challenged by the local community.\nThe pub was the site of the sort-lived Four Thorns Brewery, but this turned out to be unsustainable.\nThe pub closed in August 2016 when the licensees claimed that it was financially inviable to remain open. It then reopened in May 2017.\nIn recognition of the pubs value to the local community, in 2017 Heslington Parish Council got it listed as an Asset of Community Value by City of York Council.\nIn November 2023 the pub again had to close. It reopened shortly after Christmas, securing Shaun Wallace for one of their regular quizzes in May 2024.\n\n\n== Origin of name ==\nThe pub is named after the last family to live in Heslington Hall, the village's county manor. The Deramore baronetcy had a close connection with the village, but after selling the hall in 1956 they ceased to be as core a part of the local community. The family name of 'de Yarburgh-Bateson' was the origin of the precursor name of 'The Yarburgh Arms', but in 1967 the name was change to instead the family title.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was a notable figure in the region's history during the mid-20th century.\n\n\n== Life ==\nShah Jahan Khan was born in 1897. He was declared heir-apparent and titled Khan Bahadur in 1918. Following the death of his father, Badshah Khan, in 1925, he succeeded to the throne of Dir without any bloodshed and was officially recognized as Nawab by the government in May of that year.\n\n\n== Reign ==\nKhan is considered one of the most powerful Nawabs in the history of Dir. He maintained the state's isolation from external influences while developing personal relationships with the Kings of Iran and Afghanistan. During the First Kashmir War in 1947, he supported Pakistan by sending troops.\nOn November 8, 1947, Khan signed an instrument of accession to Pakistan. However, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, did not formally accept this accession until February 8, 1948.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nIn 1961, amid political changes, Khan was exiled by General Yahya Khan, who appointed his son, Mohammad Shah Khosru Khan, as the new Nawab. Later in the 1960s, Khan was forcibly removed from power and air-lifted to Lahore, where he lived out his remaining days in exile. He passed away during this period.\nThe princely state of Dir was integrated into Pakistan in 1969 and declared a district in 1970. In 1996, this district was further divided into Upper and Lower Dir, reflecting the administrative changes in the region over time.\n\n\n== References ==",

The Satu Mare - Baia Mare railway is part of the CFR 400 Highway and has a length of 60 km. In 1882, in Cluj (Kolozsvár in Hungarian) a group of businessmen founded the \"Anonymous Society of Local Railways Satu Mare - Baia Mare\" (in Hungarian \"Szatmárnémeti – Nagybánya helyi vasúti szöttársaság\"). The company, having multinational private capital, obtained the concession for the construction of the railway connecting Satu Mare (in Hungarian Szatmárnémeti) to Baia Mare (in Hungarian Nagybánya). The concession line with a length of 56.3 km starts from Botiz (Batiz in Hungarian), as a connecting node to the already existing line Debrecen – Szatmárnémeti (Satu Mare) – Királyháza (Korolevo) – Máramarossziget (Sighetu Marmației), was built between the years 1882-1884.[4][5] The Satu Mare – Botiz line section was operated jointly by Helyi Érdekű Vasút (Local Interest Railway) and Északkeleti Vasúttal (North-Eastern Railway). In 1904, due to the cumbersome operation of the common section of the line, HÉV built a 3.8 km section connecting Botizul to the Satu Mare station of the Hungarian Railways (Magyar Államvasutak).\n\n\n== The railway station ==\nThe Bușag station is located in the town of Tăuții Măgherăuș, the village of Bușag, located on the interoperable section Deda – Dej Triaj – Jibou - Baia Mare - Satu Mare, at kilometer 11+100 from Baia Mare station, respectively at kilometer 48+900 from Satu station Big. The station is equipped with CEM electromechanical centralization installation.\nBusag station has 4 lines, two of which are used for passenger trains and freight trains (Lines 2 and 3), and the other two are used for loading and unloading goods from vehicles (Lines 1 and 4).  The shortest line is 420 m long and the longest is 675 m.\nThe railway ensures the connection of the city of Tăuții Măgherăuș on Highway 400 to Baia Mare and Satu Mare for the rail transport of passengers and goods. InterRegio (IR) and Regio (R) trains of the operators CFR Călători and InterRegional Călători pass daily through Bușag station.\n\n\n== The distance from other railway stations in Romania and Europe ==\n\n\n=== The distance from other railway stations in Romania ===\nBușag and Arad - 303 km\nBușag and Baia Mare - 11 km\nBușag and Bucharest North (via Cluj-Napoca) - 701 km\nBușag and Bucharest North (via Deda) - 635 km\nBușag and Cluj-Napoca - 204 km\nBușag and Jibou - 69 km\nBușag and Oradea - 182 km\nBușag and Satu Mare - 49 km\n\n\n=== Distance from other train stations in Europe ===\nBușag and Hungary Keleti Budapest (via Arad) - 556 km\nBușag and Austria Vienna Hauptbahnhof (via Arad) - 818 km\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLeonard Alexandru Pop (2019).

In 2023, he was transferred to Victoria United, a team based in Limbé. In April 2024, he scored the equalizer goal to help Victoria United draw 2–2 against Stade Renard, thus helping his team officially win the Elite One title for the first time in their history.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIn 2024, he was named in Cameroon national team's final squad to participate in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations. Being the youngest member of the squad, he didn't make any appearance during the tournament.\n\n\n== Age fraud scandal ==\nHis call-up for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations sparked controversy over his age, with some expressing doubts about whether he was really 17 years old, because of his appearance that is older than his age. On 11 March 2024, the French newspaper Le Monde published an investigation, showing that Douala's name is actually Alexandre Bardelli and he would be at least 23 years old. Later in the month, Douala was included among the 62 players suspended by the Cameroonian Football Federation due to problems of age fraud and double identity, but he was later cleared by the Federation.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nVictoria United\n\nElite One: 2023–24\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWilfried Nathan Douala at Soccerway",

        "content": "Anders Peter Westenholz (16 October 1825 – 14 January 1886) was a Danish merchant and consul-general in London.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWestenholz was born in Frederikshavn, the son of  town bailiff in Frederikshavn Thomas Frederik Westenholz (1779–1830) and Anne Marie Elisabeth Aabel (1791–1880).  His father was later promoted to herredsfoged in Års nd Slet hundreds, birk judge in Løgstør Birk and landeværnsmajor. After finishing school, he got his first business education in Aalborg, after which he went abroad.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWestenholz started an independent trading firm in Leith under the company name Stegmann, Westenholz & Co. As early as 1848, his older brother Regnar Westenholz  had moved from ]]Hamburg]] to London and had started a grain import business here, which, especially after the abolition of the English grain tariff in 1849, quickly took off very significantly. In the early 1950s, Westenholz joined his brother in England, where they traded as Westenholz' Brothers. Westenholz became the sole owner of the company after the brother had bought Mattrup near Horsens and had moved to Denmark. The company's main business was primarily based on the purchase of grain and later other agricultural products from Denmark. In 1874. he took his nephew R. A. Westenholz as a partner.\nWestenholz was a very active member of the Danish colony in London. He was appointed both as Danish consul-general and as  guardian of the Danish church in the city. In 1862, he was also appointed commissioner of the Danish government at the upcoming World Exhibition in London.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1856, he married to Helen Scott Young (1832–1.1901).\nOn 1866, Westenholz  bought Dronninggård north of Copenhagen. In 1882, he moved back to Denmark. He died at Dronninggård in 1886 and is buri4ed at the local  Søllerød Cemetery.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 1859, he was created a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. In 1863, he was awarded the Cross of Honour. In 1882, he was created a 2nd-class Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n[Anders Peder Westenholz, til Dronninggård ved Holte i Nordsjælland Anders Peter Westenholz] at geni.com",

He is an emeritus professor at University of Cambridge and a part-time professor at University of Santiago, Chile.  He is most noted for his work on dependency theory, the political economy of development in Latin America  and income distribution.  He is also known for the Palma ratio which is defined as the ratio of the richest 10% of the population's share of gross national income divided by the poorest 40%'s share. This is  based on Palma's finding that middle class incomes almost always represent about half of gross national income while the other half is split between the richest 10% and poorest 40%, but that the share of those two groups varies considerably across countries.\nPalma gave the 2020 Amartya Sen Lecture, for the Human Development and Capability Association (HDCA) Conference  on What Went Wrong With European Social Democracy: On Building a Debilitating Capitalism, Where Even the Welfare State Subsidises Greater Market Inequality. \n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nPalma, G.

The authors of the flag are Vitaliy Kryvenko and Kostiantyn Shliakhovyi.\nThe flag is rectangular with the ratio of 2:3. It is divided into two vertical stripes: raspberry on the left and yellow on the right. On the raspberry stripe is the coat of arms: an image of a yellow steppe eagle, which is based on a golden statuette found in the Scythian Melgunov Kurgan. The yellow color symbolizes wealthiness, while the raspberry color symbolizes dignity, strength, and Cossack heritage.\n\n\n== References ==",

It claims to be the largest gingerbread museum in Europe.\nOpened in 2015, it is a branch of the District Museum in Toruń and was created with the cooperation with Kopernik, the oldest Polish confectionery company. Kopernik traces it roots to a gingerbread workshop established in 1763 by Johann Weese. The museum is located in the former factory building, built by Weese family in 1885. Earlier, the District Museum's collection of gingerbread-related artifacts was displayed in the cellars of the Copernicus House in Toruń.\nThe museum has 1200 square metres of exhibition space on three floors. Included are a children’s area, interactive displays, videos, communist era interiors recreation, etc. Culinary workshops are offered to the visitors as well. The museum boasts a large collection of wooden gingerbread moulds.\n\n\n== See also ==\nToruń gingerbread\nDistrict Museum in Toruń\nConfectionery Factory \"Kopernik\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nmuzeum.torun.pl/muzeum-torunskiego-piernika/",

        "content": "Malmö Museum is a municipal and regional museum in Malmö, Sweden. The museum shows exhibitions on technology, shipping, natural history and history. Malmö museum also has an aquarium. The exhibitions are primarily shown on Castle Island (Slottsholmen) and in The House of Technology and Shipping (Teknikens och sjöfartens hus).

Science Center Malmö includes the exhibitions Planet of Ideas, Vehicles of the Future, Muscles and Engines, Heaven and Earth, City of Time, Smart and Our Nature.\nMalmö Museum is also responsible for archaeological and marine archaeological finds in Malmö on behalf of the county administrative board, and has a municipal mandate for cultural heritage protection. In 2002, the museum was awarded Museum of the Year by the Swedish Museums Association. Biljana Topalova-Casadiego has been the director of Malmö Museum since 2021.\nOn April 22, 2023, the Wisdome 360° Dome Cinema, donated by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and others, was inaugurated in the partially rebuilt House of Technology and Shipping. The theater and its surrounding spaces are part of a chain of similar facilities around Sweden, showing specially made films on the themes of space and scientific research and collaborating with various universities. Malmö Museum had 633,152 visitors in 2023, the fourth highest in the country, and is now Sweden's largest museum outside Stockholm.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nMalmö Museum's collections contain approximately 500,000 objects, 4 million photographs, 3-4 million archaeological artifacts and an archive collection. The main areas of the museum's collection include cultural history, natural history, archaeology, history of technology and maritime history. Some of the museum's objects are searchable in the Carlotta database.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe museum has several permanent basic exhibitions. On Castle Island there are the basic exhibitions Malmö Castle, Power over people, By order of the King, Our nature, The Aquarium, Welcome to Sweden, Color, form and function, Beachfronts and Scanian dinosaurs and other ancient animals and Clues - postholes, DNA and other traces from the past. There are also Malmö Museum's natural history dioramas depicting Swedish nature. They were built in the 1930s and 40s.

On display at the House of Technology and Shipping until January 12, 2025.\n\n\n=== Clues - postholes, DNA and other traces from the past ===\n(Ledtrådar – stolphål, DNA och andra spår från forntiden) The exhibition is about the people who lived here long before us and the traces they left behind. From the oldest Stone Age 14 000 years ago, up to the end of the Iron Age about 1 000 years ago. Threads and parallels are drawn to our own time. The exhibition also shows how we think we know what we claim to know today about the past.\n\n\n=== Power over people ===\n(Makt över människor) The history of Malmö Castle from the 18th century to the present day is portrayed through the lives of people. The exhibition mainly highlights the period when the castle was used as a prison and the prisoners who were held at Malmöhus. The exhibition was opened in 2004.\n\n\n=== Welcome to Sweden ===\n(Välkommen till Sverige) The exhibition is about the months in 1945 when Malmö Museum was transformed from a public museum into a refugee camp. Women and men from Nazi concentration camps came to Malmö through the Red Cross rescue operation, the White Buses. One of the few remaining White Buses is displayed outside Malmö Castle.\n\n\n=== By order of the King ===\n(På kungens order) By order of the King sheds light on the history of the 17th century Scanian War and how Scania became part of Sweden.\n\n\n=== Our nature ===\n(Vår natur) Our Nature is about nature and the animals closest to us, and about how humans use and affect nature both locally and globally. The exhibition shows parts of Malmö Museum's natural history collections.\n\n\n=== The aquarium ===\n(Akvariet) Malmö Museum's Aquarium was opened in 1937. In 2015, the aquarium was completely renovated and is now twice as big as before. The aquarium is divided into three sections: Our Waters, Unique and Endangered Environments, and Amazing Features of Animals. It houses a variety of animals and environments - from coral reefs to tropical rainforests and Swedish lakes. In total, there are 60 terrariums and aquariums.\n\n\n=== Color Form Function ===\n(Färg Form Funktion) Color, Form and Function is about the functions, colors and forms of nature and animals. It features stuffed animals from around the world. These include a Przewalski's horse, a proboscis monkey and a kiwi.\n\n\n=== Scanian dinosaurs and other ancient animals ===\n(Skånska dinosaurier och andra jättegamla djur) The exhibition takes you on a journey through time, with Scania at the center, from the early days of the Earth, 4.6 billion years ago, to the present day. The exhibition includes fossil finds from dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals and plants from Scania. Over the millions of years, the climate has changed several times and thus affected the conditions for life in Scania.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\nThe main exhibitions are displayed in the buildings:\n\nMalmö Castle at the Castle Island (Slottsholmen)\nThe House of Technology and Shipping (Teknikens och sjöfartens hus)\nAlso included are buildings scattered around the city region (some temporarily closed or with other activities):\n\nThe Commandant's House (Kommendanthuset)\nEbba's House (Ebbas Hus)\nthe Castle Mill (Slottsmöllan)\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum has its origins in the natural history collection created in 1841 by the curate P. Ax. Hultman in 1841 in Nya skolan, a private school established by Hultman. In 1851 the collection was taken over by the newly established Skånskt naturhistoriskt museum. In 1890, Malmö City Council decided to take over ownership of the museum and in 1901 a newly built museum was opened. Despite the large building, however, there was soon a shortage of space.\nIn 1937, Malmö Museum opened in new modern premises on Castle Island. At that time, there was a stated ambition to present the collections in a pedagogical way for popular education purposes, so that everyone would learn something new during their visit. Instead of, as before, lining up systematic series of museum objects, new research findings in pedagogy and psychology were used as a starting point. Exhibition texts were also to be presented in a user-friendly way so as to arouse the viewer's interest. The natural history section would not only display the biological specimens, but also describe the characteristics of the species and what \"benefit or harm\" it had for humans. Newspapers described the museum as \"the most modern in Europe\". When it opened, it already had an aquatic animal section and its own restaurant.\nBetween 1985 and 1999, the city of Malmö had a joint administration for a number of museums in and around Malmö, and from 1985 to 2023 these were brought together under the name Malmö Museum. The museums that were merged were the City Museum, the Technical and Maritime Museum, the Nature Museum, the Art Museum and the City Antiquities Department. The former museums became departments with their own managers under a common museum director. In 1999 the organization was changed again and now Malmö Art Museum and the City Antiquities Unit (Malmö Cultural Environment) became separate institutions. From July 1, 2008, Malmö Cultural Environment is again part of the Malmö Museum. Since April 2023, the name Malmö Museum is again the overall name for all activities.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Janadeva Janaka (Sanskrit: जनदेव जनक) was the king of Mithila Kingdom in the Janaka Dynasty of Videha in the Indian Subcontinent. In the Shanti Parva of Mahabharata, Bhishma had narrated the story of King Janadeva Janaka to Dharmaraj Yudhishthira.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nJanadeva is a Sanskrit compound word composed of two words Jana and Deva. Jana means people and Deva means lord. Therefore, the literal meaning of Janadeva is lord of people.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIn Shanti Parva of Mahabharata, Bhishma told to Yudhishthira that once King Janadeva Janaka asked a philosophical question on salvation to the hundred acharyas in his court but none of them could satisfactorily answer his questions about salvation. Then a sage named as Panchashikha came to the court by chance advised the king about the means to attain salvation. The king got satisfied and impressed with the answer of the sage Panchashikha, then the king appointed the sage Panchashikha as his teacher. The sage Panchashikha taught Brahman Vidya and Shamkhya philosophy to the king. It is said that once Mahavishnu in the guise of a Brahmin came to the King for testing, then being pleased with the king gave him some boons.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Charles Vernon Lisle (October 1, 1906 – April 29, 1982) was an American politician.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nVern Lisle was born in Clarinda, Iowa, on October 1, 1906, to parents Edwin Lisle Sr. and Edith Crane. He had four siblings, three sisters and a brother. Lisle was educated in his hometown, attended the University of Iowa from 1923 to 1926, then transferred to the University of Michigan, where he graduated in 1928 with a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering. He then took over the leadership of family-owned manufacturing company Lisle Corporation from his father in 1936, serving as president until 1970, when he was replaced by his brother.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nLisle was elected to three terms on the Clarinda school board in the 1940s, overlapping with the start of his tenure on the Iowa House of Representatives. In total, Lisle was elected to seven consecutive terms from House District 9, and served continuously from January 10, 1949, to January 13, 1963. Between January 12, 1959, and January 8, 1961, Lisle was speaker of the state house. For the 1962 Iowa Senate election, District 6 was expanded to a multi-member district, and Lisle was elected to serve alongside incumbent senator Orval C. Walter. In 1964, District 6 reverted to a single-member district, represented solely by Lisle. Lisle won a second four-year term in 1966, but left office on October 17, 1969, necessitating a special election, won by Earl Bass.\nDuring his legislature career, Lisle was an advocate of education and community colleges. During his first legislative term, Lisle helped advance a bill on presidential primary balloting through the Iowa General Assembly. He was considered the favorite for the house speakership prior to the 58th Iowa General Assembly. After his election to the role, Lisle announced the establishment of three special committees on highway safety, reapportionment, and state planning and development. During his speakership, Lisle opposed a 1959 bill permitting dove shooting. That same year, a session of the 58th General Assembly became the first in Iowa history to cost over $1 million. In 1963, Lisle worked alongside colleagues Jack Schroeder and Howard C. Buck to review fair employment legislation.\n\n\n== Death ==\nLisle died on April 29, 1982, in Atlantic, Iowa.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rashtriya Sanjay Manch (RSM) was a political party founded by Maneka Gandhi, the widow of Indian politician Sanjay Gandhi and estranged daughter-in-law of then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, on April 3, 1983. The party was established along with Akbar Ahmad Dumpy, with a focus on youth empowerment and employment. RSM was launched with a grand inaugural convention at Feroze Shah Kotla grounds in New Delhi, which was attended by around 5,000 delegates from across the country. In 1988, the Rashtriya Sanjay Manch was merged with the Janata Dal, which was the main opposition party at that time.\n\n\n== History ==\nManeka Gandhi had previously been associated with the Congress(I) party. However, after a fallout with her mother-in-law and PM Indira Gandhi, she was forced to leave the prime minister's residence at 1, Safdarjung Road. After that, Maneka Gandhi established Rashtriya Sanjay Manch, which aimed to provide a platform for her political aspirations and address the youth's concerns. The party was based on the ideology of Sanjay Gandhi.\n\nBefore the party's launch, Maneka had already established an organization known as the Sanjay Vichar Manch (SVM), which later transformed into the youth wing of the Rashtriya Sanjay Manch.\nManeka Gandhi was the face of the party and had a significant following. She claimed that the party had 800,000 members. Her political career took a turn when she contested the 1984 general election against Rajiv Gandhi for the Amethi Lok Sabha constituency but lost.\nAs of April 1983, the party had two Members of Parliament, including former deputy finance minister Maganbhai Barot, along with two Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) from Uttar Pradesh, one MLA from Bihar, and four MLAs from Andhra Pradesh.\nIn the 1984 Malihabad assembly by-election, Brij Lal, a gram pradhan from Amethi and candidate of RSM, won against Shanti Kureel of the Congress(I) by over 7,400 votes. This victory made other political parties acknowledge growing influence of Rashtriya Sanjay Manch.\nIn 1987, the RSM candidate Akbar Ahmad Dumpy, with support from the Janata Party and the Lok Dal won the assembly election in the Kashipur  against the Congress(I) candidate and the state's Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Ammar Rizvi.\n\n\n=== 1983 Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh ===\nIn the 1983 assembly election, the party formed an alliance with the Telugu Desam Party and secured victory in four out of the five seats it contested. Meanwhile, the Telugu Desam Party, its ally, won 199 seats. It was the first time in Andhra Pradesh's history that a non-Congress party was voted to power.\n\n\n== Controversies and criticism of Indira Gandhi ==\nIn September 1982, three individuals closely associated with Maneka, including Vice President of Rashtriya Sanjay Manch, Akbar Ahmad Dumpy, were arrested on charges related to the death of a servant. The court promptly dismissed the case. The media frenzy over the incident fueled public suspicion of PM Indira Gandhi suppressing Maneka's group. It also heightened criticism of Indira's leadership, with accusations of authoritarianism and cronyism.\nLater, Dumpy, who was a co-accused in the case of the killing of the servant, was acquitted by a special court in November 2022.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of political parties in India\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nManeka Gandhi Launches Political Party - Associated Press (AP Archive)",

        "content": "The Battle of Morbihan, also known as the Battle of Quiberon Bay, was a naval battle fought in the summer of 56 BC between the Gallic tribe of the Veneti and a Roman fleet sent by Julius Caesar. The battle was fought off the coast of Brittany in modern-day France, likely near Quiberon Bay. The battle was a part of the Gallic Wars. The battle ended in a decisive Roman victory.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the winter of 57–56 BC, Publius Crassus was stationed among the Andecavi. Since the Romans were undersupplied, Crassus sent officers to neighboring tribes to procure food and provisions. Quintus Velanius and Titus Silius were sent to the Veneti, where they were detained. The Veneti offered to return Velanius and Silius, if the Romans returned the hostages they had previously given to Crassus. Caesar interpreted these detentions as an act of war. After receiving word in Illyricum from Crassus, Caesar ordered a fleet to be built on the river Loire and rowers and seamen to be recruited. When the Veneti learned that Caesar was headed towards them, they prepared for war by gathering their navy and allying with the nearby Osismii, Lexovii, Namnetes, Ambiliati, Morini, Diablintes, and Menapii. Caesar appointed Decimus Brutus to command the Roman fleet.\nThe Veneti held the upper hand for much of the campaign. Their ships were well-suited to the region, and when their hill forts were under siege, they could simply evacuate them by sea. Despite having the superior army and great siege equipment, the Romans were making little progress. Caesar realized that the campaign could not be won on land and halted the campaign until the Roman fleet was complete. The fleet was complete near the end of the summer of 56 BC.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nThe Roman fleet met the Veneti fleet around Quiberon Bay. The Veneti fleet had around 220 ships while the Romans are estimated to be outnumbered around two to one, giving a fleet of 110. Caesar and the Roman army overlooked the battle from cliffs nearby, possibly in modern-day Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys. The battle occurred close to shore allowing Caesar and his soldiers to watch and encourage the Roman fleet. The Venetic ships were designed for the open ocean of the Atlantic and so were much larger than the Roman ships adapted to the Mediterranean Sea. Merely the stern of the Venetic ship surpassed the height of the Roman ships, even when equipped with turrets. The Venetic ships were made out of sturdy oak and used sails made of leather to survive ocean-storm weather. Venetic ships were powered entirely by sails as opposed to Roman ships primarily powered by rowers. The Venetic ships were too large and sturdy to ram and so the Romans devised a different plan.\nThe Romans attached hooks to the end of wooden poles on their ships. During the engagement, Roman ships positioned next to the Venetic ships until the hooks would catch the Veneti's halyards that held the yard to the mast. Once the hook caught, the Romans rowed fast ahead so the halyard was cut causing the yard and sail to drop. With their sails disabled, the Venetic ships were rendered immobile leaving them vulnerable to encirclement by two or three Roman vessels, which boarded and overpowered the Veneti.\nThe remaining uncaptured ships saw the Roman tactics and began to flee. Soon after the retreat began, the wind stopped and the remaining Venetic ships were stuck in place since they lacked rowers. The attempted flight caused the Venetic ships to become dispersed and unable to help one another. The Romans continued to board the Venetic ships as they had before the flight. Almost all Venetic ships were captured or destroyed using these tactics. The battle lasted from around 10 o-clock in the morning until sunset. Only a few remaining Venetic ships escaped under cover of night.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe surviving Veneti surrendered to Julius Caesar following the Battle of Morbihan. Julius Caesar had all members of the Veneti's ruling senate put to death and sold the rest of the population into slavery. The severity of the punishment was most likely intended to make an example of the Veneti and deter any further uprisings in Gaul.\nCaesar later used the fleet built for the Battle of Morbihan in his invasions of Britain.\n\n\n== Historiography ==\nSimilar to many events within the Gallic Wars, Commentarii de Bello Gallico by Julius Caesar is the only primary source documenting the events of the Battle of Morbihan. Unexplained within Caesar's account is the delay in constructing the fleet. The fleet took around nine months to prepare, longer than the standard time for fleet construction at the time.\nLater historians have criticized the cruelty Caesar treated the Veneti to following the battle. Napoleon, in his commentaries on the wars of Julius Caesar, says \"this conduct was not just; still less was it politic. Such means never achieve their aim; they anger and disgust the nations. The punishment of a few chief people is all that justice and policy permit; it is an important rule to treat prisoners well.\" Several historians argue that this punishment among other actions against the Gauls satisfy the modern definition of genocide.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Goodenia macrocalyx is a species of flowering plant in the family Goodeniaceae and is endemic to north-eastern Australia. It is a glabrous, perennial herb with elliptic to narrowly egg-shaped leaves at the base of the plant, yellow flowers and narrowly oval fruit.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGoodenia macrocalyx is a glabrous perennial herb with elliptic to narrowly egg-shaped leaves at the base of the plant, 50–150 mm (2.0–5.9 in) long and 20–40 mm (0.79–1.57 in) wide, sometimes toothed near the base, on a petiole 5–15 mm (0.20–0.59 in) long. The flowers are arranged on a peduncle up to 350 mm (14 in) long, with linear to elliptic bracteoles] 5–40 mm (0.20–1.57 in) long and 1–25 mm (0.039–0.984 in) wide. The sepals are elliptic to egg-shaped, 12 mm (0.47 in) long and the petals are yellow, 10–12 mm (0.39–0.47 in) long and hairy on the outer surface. The lower lobes of the corolla are 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long. The fruit is a narrowly oval capsule 7–8 mm (0.28–0.31 in) long containing broadly elliptic seeds 1.5 mm (0.059 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\nThis species was first formally described in 1848 by Willem Hendrik de Vriese who gave it the name Velleia macrocalyx in Thomas Mitchell's Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia. In 2020, Kelly Anne Shepherd transferred the species to Goodenia as G. macrocalyx in the journal PhytoKeys. The specific epithet macrocalyx means \"large sepals\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis goodenia grows in woodland and grassland in the Northern Territory and in Queensland from the Barkly Tableland and Sandover River to the Burdekin River.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nGoodenia macrocalyx is classified as of \"least concern\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992 and the Northern Territory Government Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1976.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ryś Battalion The Consipration Battalion of the Peasant Battalions, which operated in the Hrubieszów District from 1942 to 1945, numbered several hundred men at its peak, and was one of the largest groups that fought against the Ukrainian Nationalist troops and the Wermacht. The Battalion played an important role in the history of some people, preventing the pacification and massacre of villages and becoming one of the most famous battalions in the district\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Zamość Uprising ===\nIn the same area, in the south of the district, where the battalion of District 5 South, commanded by Stefan Kwaśniewski \"Wiktor\", operated, there was a BCh battalion, under the command of Stanisław Basaj \"Rys\".The history of this battalion has a relatively rich literature. It is mentioned in the publication \"Źródła i materiały do dziejów Ruchu Oporu na Lubelszczyźnie\" in volume two \"Bataliony Chłopskie na Lubelszczyźnie\".and volume five \"Kalendarium walki Batalionów Chłopskich na Lubelszczyźnie\". This is where the annexes in this study on the BCh District come from. Jerzy Markiewicz in his book \"Paprocie zakwitły krwią partzantów\" (\"Ferns bloomed with the blood of partisans\") and Wojciech Sulewski in his booklet \"Lasy płoną\" (\"Forests are burning\") write about the history of this battalion. The genesis and political foundation of the BCh battalion is mentioned in this work in the chapter \"Ruch ludowy, SL, ROCH, Chłostra, Bataliony Chłopskie\". In the aforementioned second volume of \"Źródeł i materiały do dziejów ruchu oporu na Lubelszczyźnie\" (\"Sources and Materials for the History of the Resistance Movement in the Lublin Region\") (Wydawnictwo Lubelskie, 1960), the formation of this formation is presented in the following way (p. 15).\nFrom November 1942, the next phase of the General Plan East, approved by Heinrich Himmler on 12 June 1942, began to be implemented in the Zamojskie region; following this, Himmler issued another decree (12 November 1942), which was a formal act recognising Zamojskie as the first settlement area (Siedlungsstutzpunkte) in the General Government (GG); there were to be 14 of them in the GG. On 28 November 1942, a great displacement action began, the brutality and bestiality of which were unprecedented in the history of Europe; villages were surrounded at night, the entire population was herded to a selected square, often murdering the infirm and resistant; the population was also segregated; Children were detached and sent to resettlement or concentration camps in the interior of the country or to concentration camps, while \"racially pure\" children were sent to be Germanised; as the action took place in late autumn and winter, trains full of frozen corpses of children circulated in the country.\n\nGerman colonists from almost the whole of Europe – from the Reich, Bessarabia, Romania, Slovenia and the USSR – were brought to replace the displaced Poles; a special policy was applied to local Ukrainians (\"Ukraineraktion\"), settling them on the shores of the settlement belt to protect the Germans from attacks by the Polish underground.\nIn the spring of 1942, a small operational group was formed in the village of Małków in the Hrubieszów district, headed by Stanisław Basaj \"Ryś\". \n\n\n=== Battalion was Formed and his First battles ===\nThis group grew rapidly in numbers and in July 1943 formed a battalion headed by the so-called 'Headquarters'. It consisted of: as commander, Stanisław Basaj \"Ryś\", Zenon Pielachowski \"Dzierżyński\", Jerzy Brzuś \"O stoja\", Józef Wolański \"Igor\" and Stanisław Hulak \"Stępień\". The battalion consisted of ten platoons, a non-commissioned officer school, a reconnaissance team, a sanitary section and rolling stock. The total strength was 670 privates; 59 NCOs and four . Battalion fought at Zamość Uprising\nIn late autumn, Stanislaw Basaj's troops were quartered and gathering strength for further battles, but this calm was disturbed by the 14th SS Grenadier Division in the strength of 2 companies. They attacked the villages of Górka-Zabłocie and Małków, where Stanislaw Basaj's forces and the Home army were stationed, and easily dealt with the attack, The next day Ryś struck at the same forces that had attacked him, the Ukrainian forces were at a disadvantage, inflicting heavy losses on them, thus preventing the pacification of Malkov, but on 14 February probably 140 soldiers of the Ryś battalion and the Home Army fought a battle with German forces near Zabłocie, the day-long battle ended in a Polish victory and inflicting colossal losses on the Germans, thanks to which the Basaj's troops captured ammunition and weapons from the Germans. On 27 February, there was another skirmish near Malkov, where the battalion claimed victory over the SS Beyersdorf Battle Group and the Ukrainian National Self-Defence. Sparing the Polish population, they bravely attacked another detachment of the 14th Division's Granadiers and police; the Ukrainians were beaten in the villages of Górna and Łasków; on that day still, Basaj and \"Bold\" again went to Małków for ammunition, where they easily dealt with the Ukrainian militia there\nThe Fighting Poland reacted decisively to the German rape, and the resistance assumed such proportions that it came to be known as the Zamość Uprising; Basaj, who immediately turned his OS into a strong partisan unit, also had a significant part in this. On 15 January 1943, in Tuchania near Dubienka, he fought a battle against the German gendarmerie and Ukrainian police, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy; on 20 January, his 100-strong unit attacked the German gendarmerie and police in Józefów, claiming victory; in pursuit of the Germans, he fought skirmishes in Bokini and Wysoki; in February, it attacked the Ukrainian base in Kryłów, liquidating the policemen and smashing a detachment of Cossacks in the village of Małków; it fought an all-day battle at Modryń and Mircz, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy; on 15 and 17 March, it liquidated the Ukrainian posts in Modryń and Łasków. On March 18, the \"Rysia\" battalion carried out an operation against a detachment of Ukrainian nationalists in the village of Górki and, in pursuit of them, smashed a German vehicle column, also destroying two cannons. On 20 March, he saved the Polish population in the village of Modryń from being murdered by driving out an Ukrainian Insurgent Army unit. On 3 April, attacking Prehoryłe, he smashed an Ukrainian Insurgent Army unit and took revenge for the murder of the Polish population. In May, he fought the Ukrainians at Hołuba, and the Germans near Hrubieszów. In Kolonia Prehoryłe he smashed a unit of Ukrainian Insurgent Army and German gendarmerie murdering Polish population. On 15 August, 3 platoons from the \"Rysia\" battalion near the village of Mieniany fought a victorious battle with the Ukrainian police and units of the collaborationist Ukrainian 14th Division of the\nFebruary 1943. \"Ryś\" with a group of soldiers carries out a successful action against the Ukrainian police in Kryłów during the funeral of a Ukrainian policeman. In the same month an action of the \"Rys\" detachment against a Ukrainian unit takes place. Livestock looted from the Poles was taken back. March 1943 The \"Rysia\" detachment carries out an action against Ukrainian posts in Łasków and Szychowice. A few days later the Germans attack Małków. Relief comes from the direction of Modryń, where AK is stationed. The battle area stretched from Modryń to Mircz. The battle lasted all day. 27 Germans and Ukrainians were killed. Own losses 3 killed and 5 wounded. The Ukrainians retreated to Sahryń, the Germans to Hrubieszów\nOn 18 March 1943, BCh units came to the relief of the Górka colony attacked by Ukrainians. In pursuit of the Ukrainians, they encountered the Germans on the Hrubieszów-Sokal road. In April 1943, another defence of Malkov against the onslaught of Ukrainian nationalists. Battle in the village of Prehoryłe. Unsuccessful attack on the village of Holubie. September 1943 three platoons from the BCh battalion take part in a battle in Sahryń. Own losses 1 killed, 1 wounded. Ukrainians six killed. Further battles in defence of the attacked villages of Małków and Górki  \n\nIn the summer of 1943, the Germans practically ceased their displacement actions in the Zamojszczyzna region, as they no longer had the strength to continue implementing the General Plan East; pacifications and anti-partisan operations were carried out more with a view to ensuring security at the frontline; from the earlyly spring of 1944, the Zamojszczyzna region experienced a new tragedy; the nationalist Ukrainian movement (OUN, UPA), supported by the Germans, undertook concentrated and ruthless actions aimed at pushing back or liquidating the Polish element from the south-eastern districts of Zamojskie (Hrubieszów, Tomaszów, Bilgoraj); \nRyś conducted Attack on police station in Mieniany. 7 Ukrainian policemen were killed. December 1943 Attack by Ukrainians on Modryń on Christmas Eve. Own losses 7 people, Ukrainian losses 14. 3 rifles captured\n\n\n=== 1944 ===\nA skirmish with Ukrainians and Germans is reported on 18 January. On 7 February, the Ukrainians attack Małków. The BCh troops are commanded by Karol (kaczała). Own losses 3 dead and 7 wounded. The enemy has 22 killed, On 11 February, the Bechov soldiers set up an ambush on the wedding of a Ukrainian policeman in Wereszyn. 4 Ukrainian policemen and 1 German were killed. 1 rkm, 2 rifles and 1 wis were captured. 14 February 1944 Battle of Zabłocie with participation of BCh and AK. In the next action, on 16 February 1944, when the Germans and Ukrainians attacked Małków again from the direction of Dołhobycz and Waręż, \"Ryś\" wanted to act completely independently, without the help of the AK. This risked defeat. It was then that a battalion of the Home Army came to his aid, taking the Germans into clutches\n\nOn 17 February, the Germans directed their attack on Prehoryłe, with the relief of a BCh unit came to the rescue. On 27 February, another attack by the Ukrainians on Łasków and Górki. Co-operating AK and BCh units. Two Ukrainians were killed. 2 rifles, 3 grenades and a nagan were captured.10.On 5 March a clash with the Ukrainian SS Galizien and Ortschutz was recorded, in which 1 BCh soldier was killed and 1 wounded. When, on 9 March, two battalions of the Home Army under the command of Stefan Kwasniewski and Zenon Jachymek took action against the Ukrainians with a broad front from Prehoryłe to Sahryń, initially the BCh units did not participate in this battle took part in this battle, with the exception of a small detachment which served as a guide. However, as the action developed, the BCh units joined the action on the eastern wing of the battle, where Stefan Kwaśniewski was in command. I am writing about this more extensively, as Wojciech Sulewski in his publications attributes to the battalion of \"Rysia\" battalion the whole of this battle, which is not true\nOn 15 March 1944 \"Ryś\", surprised near the village of Proske, smashed a German patrol. On March 16/17 the 1st Battalion fought a battle with a pacification group consisting of gendarmes, SS men and Ukrainian police from the UPA \"Jahoda\" group, which attacked the village of Łasków, the Zabłocie colony and Małków. The battalion was supported by Home Army units of Olszak \"Hardy\" and Aleksandrov \"Brawura\". The attackers were smashed. The effectiveness of \"Ryś\" actions caused a strong German response. On 19 March, units of the 14th SS Grenadier Division, Ortschutz, Ukrainian police and partly Schupo and gendarmes, launched a large-scale operation against the Basaj battalion and the \"Wiktor\" AK battalion. When the Germans encircled one of the \"Rys\" platoons in the village of Łasków, the main forces of the Basaj battalion and the \"Wiktor\" battalion rushed to the aid of the encircled. \"Rys\" pushed out the enemy and captured the Mircze-Kryłów road. At the same time, \"Czarusia\" and \"Wiktor\" companies of the Home Army drove the enemy back from the Sokal-Hrubieszow road and captured Mircze; having achieved these objectives, the Polish units captured the last points of enemy resistance in the villages of: Modryń, Modryniec and Masłomęcz The third phase of operations attacked Ukrainian self-defence bases in the villages of: Mieniany, Kozodawy, Cichobórz and Kosmów, completely driving out their crews. Significant losses were inflicted on the enemy, but the \"Rysia\" battalion also lost several men.\nOn 19 and 20 March, the BCh battalion, with the support of the AK battalion, fought a great battle with the Germans, who struck with large forces at Górki, Lasków, Małków from the east and from the west from the vicinity of Stara Wieś. After this battle the BCh battalion withdrew to the Topmaszowski district, destroying during the march the narrow-gauge railway tracks leading from Hrubieszów to Uhnowo.At that time, in April, and not in May 1944, as it is stated in the BCh report, a platoon under the command of Władysław Tuchowski \"Kordian\" came under the command of the BCh, in the strength of 25 men.\nThe activity of ‘Rys’ worried the German command. As a consequence, a decision was made to carry out a large-scale counter-partisan operation in the southern part of the Hrubieszów district. The punitive expedition, which was commanded by Lt. Col. Werner Froemert, included: the Ukrainian Self-Defence Legion, sub-units of the 5th Galician SS Volunteer Regiment, a detachment of the German 154th Infantry Division, Ordnungspolizei functionaries, and a battery of armoured guns. On 27 March the Germans and their Ukrainian collaborators surrounded the ‘Ryś’ battalion, as well as an AK outpost commanded by Mieczysław Olszak, pseud. ‘Hardy’. After a fierce battle, ‘Rys’ and part of his unit managed to break out of the encirclement, but the Polish partisans suffered heavy losses, Majewski writes that the Poles lost from 33 to 75 partisans killed, while Peasant Battalion memoirs claim that 27 Poles were killed. After the battle, the Germans and their Ukrainian collaborators proceeded to pacify Smoligów. After the battle in Smoligów, in fear of more German anti-partisan actions, Basaj decided to evacuate his unit to the Tomaszów county.\nFor about a week, a BCh battalion has been stationed in areas belonging to District 4 of the AK. These are villages in the communes of Miączyn and Molodiatycze. Here, too, one platoon of the AK under the command of Władysław Adamowicz \"Taran\" comes under the command of the BCh. After a temporary stay in this area, the BCh battalion passes to Puszcza Solska. Here there is an encounter with a unit of Soviet partisans, under the command of Colonel Shangin. On 25 May, the BCh units, with the assistance of miners from Szangin's unit, destroyed a bridge over the Tanew River, on the Biłgo raj-Tarnogród road. On 5 June, an agreement on mutual assistance and cooperation was signed by \"Rysio\" and Szangin\nIn the first half of June, Stanisław Basaj \"Ryś\", together with part of his battalion, returned to the Hrubieszów poviat to collect the hidden weapons and ammunition. The second part of the battalion under the command of Antoni Warchał \"Szczerba\" took part in the Battle of Osuchy from 25 to 28 June. A detailed description of this bloody and tragic battle is given in the book Jerzy Markiewicz's book titled \"The Blood of Ferns. \"Ferns bloomed with the blood of partisans\". The battalion suffered heavy losses. The commander of the unit, Antoni Warchał \"Szczerba\", the commander of the non-commissioned officer school Pielachowski \"Dzierżyński\" and many others\nAfter this battle, part of the battalion returned to the south of Hrubieszów poviat, the command proceeded to rebuild its forces. A few weeks later, the district was liberated by the encroaching Red Army and Polish Army units. The BCh battalion under the command of \"Rys\" and the AK South battalion under the command of Stefan Kwaśniewski \"Wiktor\" operated in the same area, so they constantly constantly came into contact with each other. Relations between these formations were characterised by of competition. Wherever there was a threat of danger from Germans or Wherever there was a danger from Germans or Ukrainians, the Home Army and the BCh cooperated with each other. There is no mistake in saying that in all battles fought by AK battalions, units of BCh also participated and vice versa, where the BCh fought, the Home Army came with support. It was only after the battle that arguments began about whose participation in the battle was greater and about the division of the spoils of war between the two organisations.\nBasaj was killed on 25 March 1945 during a UPA attack on Kryłów. Basaj was found and detained in one of the houses in Kryłów. He was placed in the corner of the room, his coat and shoes were taken away, and then he was abused. The perpetrators also undressed the 17 MO officers lying on the floor and tied up, and then shot them all. Ukrainian nationalists also murdered 28 civilian residents of Kryłów. According to another version, Basaj lost his life on 27 March 1945, two days after his abduction from Kryłów. He was interrogated in Liski Waręskie in the presence of the highest-ranking members of the Ukrainian underground in the Chełm region, probably including the OUN-B Security Service referent Łeonid Łapinśki \"Zenon\". This is also where all trace of Basaj disappears. Presumably he was executed in this area.\n\n\n== List of Ryś Battles ==\n\n\n== Assessment Of Activities ==\nBasaj and his battalion played a very important role in the Zamość Uprising and especially in skirmishes with the Ukrainians, defeating them battle after battle and saving many pacified villages as in the battle of Małków or at Mieniany. Ryś showed us how to build a holy partisan force, which only needs to be supplied with weapons and a commander to pose a very great threat. The battalion's losses were mainly due to the overwhelming superiority of the enemy, who was equipped with modernised weapons. at the peak moment the battalion had even 800 men.\n\n\n== References ==",

In an interview for Entertainment Tonight, Williams said: \"Diahann played my mother in a movie I produced, The Courage to Love, and has always been a huge inspiration for me,\" she noted. \"I remember seeing her talking to Oprah about her autobiography. She spoke so beautifully and confidently about her age and power and the fact that beauty fades but your legs give you strength and are the last to go.\"\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe accompanying video for \"Legs (Keep Dancing)\" was released on YouTube on April 26, 2024.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Music Video on YouTube",

Their dignified presence and significant influence reflected their esteemed status and profound impact on Sulu's history.\n\n\n=== Inheritance and Valor ===\nPanglima Bandahala's lineage, marked by bravery and valor, inherited a legacy from figures like Binatal Ara'. Binatal Ara's role in overseeing the Gibha  ceremony, essential for Sultan succession, laid the foundation for Panglima Bandahala's subsequent stewardship, further cementing their family's enduring legacy within Sulu's history.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBa 'Alawi sada\nKalingalan Caluang\nSayyid Capt.

It is located 435 million light-years away from the Solar System and was discovered on February 9, 1874, by Ralph Copeland.\nNGC 3753 is classified as a LINER galaxy meaning, it presents an emission spectrum characterized by broad lines of weak ionized atoms. It also has a luminosity class of I-II.\n\n\n== Copeland Septet ==\n\nNGC 3753 is a member of the Copeland Septet which consists of 7 galaxies discovered by Copeland in 1874. The other members are NGC 3746, NGC 3745, NGC 3748, NGC 3750, NGC 3751 and NGC 3754.\nHalton Arp noticed the 7 galaxies in the group, in which he published the article in 1966. The group is designated as Arp 320 along another galaxy, PGC 36010.\nThis group was observed by Paul Hickson in which he included them in his article in 1982. The group is known as Hickson 57 in which NGC 3753 is the dominant member.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The bombardment of Tangier was a naval attack launched on August 24, 1791, by Spain against the Moroccan city of Tangier in response to the Moroccan sultan Moulay Yazid's declaration of war and siege of Ceuta.\nFollowing the failure of peace attempts between Spain and Morocco, Spanish King Charles IV also officially declared war on Morocco and ordered the bombardment of Tangier. The city of Tangier was a well-known departure point for Moroccan privateers, who captured or hindered Spanish merchants. The bombardment was intended to stop these activities and, above all, to encourage a rebellion by the local population against the Sultan, who had been besieging Ceuta since September 25, 1790. News of the upcoming Spanish navy arrived to Moulay Yazid. The inhabitants of Tangier evacuated the city before their arrival. Moulay Yazid entrusted the defenses to Sidi Ali ben Ahmed and recruited the tribes there for a holy war, which he did.\nA light Spanish squadron was sent under the command of Lieutenant-General Javier Morales de los Ríos. It reached Tangier Bay on August 23 and began bombarding the port on the 24th, from five in the morning until three in the afternoon. Weather conditions forced the Spanish fleet to withdraw. The city of Tangier, which had been fortified in the knowledge of an imminent attack, suffered very little damage, while the Spanish sustained some casualties and damages to the ships due to Moroccan artillery fire.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCarmona Portillo, Antonio (2004).

        "content": "The Miner's Trust is a 1908 Australian play by Jo Smith. It was Smith's first play and very successful. The play was rare for Australian plays at the time in that it was an original for the stage, not an adaptation of a novel or historical event.\nThe play was produced and directed by John Gunn, a leading theatre manager of the time. He said \"I have read many and good Australian manuscripts, but this us far and away the best I have been privileged to glance through.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviews were generally strong. '\nEvening Sun said \"Few imported dramas of the kind, it is said, have the absorbingly interesting plot that characterises A Miner's Trust which, moreover, is not written in the hysterical key common to most melodramas.\"\nThe Sydney Morning Herald said it \"possesses a higher standard of literary excellence and dramatic construction than much of the similar work, of English playwrights.\"\nThe Daily Telegraph said \"The piece is straight-out melodrama, the central ide is as preposterous as usual, and conventionalities aro well preserved. Mr. Smith, however, having got the Idea, sticks to It with praiseworthy determination, and allows no side-stepping, but bustles tho story along to the .Inevitable end with considerable Ingenuity and woll-contrlvcd dramatic effects.\"\n\n\n== Premise ==\nTwo Englishmen, John Howard and Alan Trengrove, have been prospecting in Red Hills, Victoria. They strike a rich claim, then return to Melbourne. On the way, John is shot and killed by a French bushranger, an escapee from New Caldeonia. Alan decides to impersonate John to marry John's blind fiancée, Alice Medway, and say that Alan was murdered. Alan then discovers he has inherited a fortune from an uncle in America but this has gone to his villainous cousin Arthur, as they think \"Alan\" is dead. Alan also falls in love with Ida Medway. Alan hears of a shipwreck and helps rescues the passengers, who include the French bushranger, returning home to France. The bushranger recognises Alan which makes Arthur suspicious. Alan confesses his deception to Ida's father, which is overheard by Alice. Alice gives up her claim to \"John\" (Alan). Arthur loses his fortune. The French bushranger is arrested.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Miner's Trust at Ausstage",

He was an out-half and played with Dublin club Lansdowne through the 1950s. His goal-kicking prowess saw him accumulate over 1,000 points in senior rugby, the first Irish player to achieve this feat.\nKelly's career coincided with Jack Kyle's time as Ireland out-half, which limited his international opportunities. He appeared sporadically between 1954 and 1960, debuting in a Five Nations win over Scotland at Ravenhill, to become the first national player to come from Wexford. Capped five times, Kelly scored a total of 12 points, with four penalties.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Ireland national rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSeamus Kelly at ESPNscrum",

        "content": "Margarida Maria de Moura Alves da Silva de Almeida Saavedra (born 1952) is a Portuguese architect who, in the March 2024 election, was elected to be a deputy in the 16th Legislature of the Third Portuguese Republic. She is a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and was elected to represent the Lisbon constituency. \n\n\n== Career ==\nSaavedra was born on 22 October 1952. She obtained university qualifications as an architect and in 1979 joined the Lisbon City Council as a result of a public examination. She has worked with the city council on urban management since that time, being with the Empresa Pública de Urbanização de Lisboa (Lisbon Urbanization Public Company) since 2010. She has said that when she served as director of urban management, she succeeded in reducing a backlog of planning cases from 12,000 to nil in two years. A former councillor on Lisbon City Council, she was also writing regular opinion pieces for the newspaper, Público.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn the 2024 national election, called early after the resignation of prime minister António Costa following allegations of corruption by members of his Socialist Party (PS) government, the PSD formed an alliance with two smaller parties, known as the Democratic Alliance (AD). Saavedra was eighth on the AD list of candidates for the Lisbon district and was elected when the AD won 13 of the 48 seats available in the constituency. In the parliament she became a member of the Economy, Public Works, and Housing Committee.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nOn 18 April 2024 a request was made by a judge for the waiving of parliamentary immunity of Saavedra and two other PSD deputies, Luís Newton and Carlos Eduardo Reis, as part of an investigation into an alleged conspiracy on the part of PSD and PS members from 2016 to allocate political places in the parishes and municipalities of the Lisbon district. Saavedra was under investigation for \"qualified fraud\". According to the law, those elected to Parliament cannot be defendants without authorization from the Assembly of the Republic, which is mandatory when there is strong evidence of committing an intentional crime that carries a prison sentence whose limit maximum is more than 3 years.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Superfest, also called CV-Glas or Ceverit until 1980, was a brand of drinking glasses in the GDR. Due to being made of chemically strengthened glass, they were almost unbreakable. The Superfest glasses were produced between 1980 and 1990 in what was then State-owned Sachsenglas Schwepnitz.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the mid-1970s, attempts began in the GDR to make conventional thin-walled commercial glass stronger and more heat-resistant. The Glass Structure Research Department, founded in 1973 by the Central Institute for Organic Chemistry, investigated ion exchange. In an additional processing step, smaller sodium ions on the surface of the glass are replaced by larger potassium ions, which increases the tension in the glass surface, making it stronger. This technique is also used to make Gorilla Glass.\nOn August 8, 1977, a four-person team led by the scientist Dieter Patzig registered patent number 157966 Method and device for solidifying glass products by ion exchange for solidified drinking glass. In November 1978, a Council of Ministers decision secured the financing of this “project of particular urgency”. The glass brand resulting from the invention was called CEVERIT, composed of CE (chemical) + VER (solidified) + IT (usual ending for mineral substances). The aim was to have five times the lifespan of an ordinary drinking glass, but fifteen times lifespan was achieved. Other advantages included heat resistance, stackability, and lower weight.\nThe scientists had a small team of assistants who helped perfect the material every day. Elfriede Hilma Matzko, a trained metallographer, worked on Dieter Patzig's team as a physical assistant. For several years, she measured cracks in the glass every day, forwarded evaluations to the scientists, and thus contributed to improving the strength of the glass. The scientists and their team of assistants from the GDR Academy of Sciences (AdW) received an honor and a cash reward for their innovation. This bonus was paid to only full-time employees and not to part-time employees. Elfriede Hilma Matzko, mother of four children, therefore received no bonus as a part-time worker.\n\nProduction began in spring 1980 at Sachsenglas Schwepnitz and was initially limited to beer glasses. At the suggestion of the West German sales representative Eberhard Pook, the name of the brand was changed to Superfest. The total daily energy consumption of the system, which was designed for a throughput of up to 48,000 quarter-liter jars per day, was between 250 and 350 kWh. By the end of production on July 1, 1990, 110 to 120 million super-strength drinking glasses in all sizes were manufactured. The main customer was the GDR gastronomy. The intended sale in the Federal Republic did not take place. “With Coca Cola, for example, they said: Why should we use a glass that doesn't break? We make money with our glasses. […] The dealers said understandably: Who would saw off the branch he was sitting on?” (Eberhard Pook)Shot glasses, vases, ice cream cups, and other shapes were later added to the range.\nWith the political change, the GDR glass industry and its scientific institutions began to be wound down. In July 1990, the Schwepnitz glassworks became SAXONIA-Glas GmbH Schwepnitz, which was liquidated by the Treuhand in 1991. In April 1992, the patent was abandoned by the inventors.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe technology developed for Superfest glass has been recognized as a milestone in the field of glass science and engineering. Today, the glass is highly collectible and sought after by enthusiasts and dealers due to its rarity and historical significance.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "NGC 3746 is a large barred spiral galaxy with a ring structure located in the Leo constellation. It is located 449 million light-years from the Solar System and has an approximate diameter of 165,000 light-years. NGC 3746 was discovered by Ralph Copeland on 9 February 1874 with subsequent observations made by Hermann Kobold, Lawrence Parsons and John Louis Emil Dreyer.\nThe luminosity class of NGC 3746 is II and it has a broad H II region with a recessed core (RET).\n\n\n== Supernovae ==\nTwo supernovae have been discovered in NGC 3746 so far: SN 2002ar and SN 2005ba.\nSN 2002ar\nSN 2002ar was discovered by Dr W.D. Li from the University of California, Berkeley via unfiltered CCD images which was taken by the 0.8-m Katzman Automatic Imagining Telescope on 3 and 4 February 2002. It was located 3\".3 east and 0\".5 south of the nucleus. The supernova was Type la.\nSN 2005ba\nSN 2005ba was discovered on 1 April 2005 by Norwegian scientists Arne  Danielsen, Mikkel Steine, and Stale Kildahl via unfiltered images taken from a 'Celestron 14' reflector at Veggli, Norway. It was located 14\".6 west and 4\".0 north of the nucleus. The supernova was Type II.\n\n\n== Copeland Septet ==\n\nNGC 3746 is a member of the Copeland Septet which comprises 7 galaxies discovered by Copeland in 1874. The other 6 members are NGC 3748, NGC 3754, NGC 3753, NGC 3750, NGC 3745 and NGC 3751. Together, they are known as Hickson 57 and Arp 320.\n\n\n== References ==",

One of the better known traits of the deep-sea anglerfishes is their extreme sexual dimorphism where the males are many times smaller than the females, the males seek out females and use their sharp teeth to clamp onto the females where he remains for the rest of his life, in some species he becomes part of the female. This is the only known natural example of a process called parabiosis. Another common trait of deep-sea anglerfishes is that they use bioluminescence on their esca to attract prey in the darkness of the deep oceans they inhabit. \n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCeratioidei was first proposed as a grouping in 1912 by the English ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan as the division Ceratiformes within the suborder Lophoidea of the order Pediculati, which included the Batrachoididae. The Batrachoididae are not now cosidered to be closely related to the anglerfishes which are now included in the order Lophiiformes. Ceratioidei are in the same clade as the Chaunacoidei with the Antennarioidei and the Ogcocephaloidei as the sisters of that clade. The 5th edition of Fishes of the World treats this grouping as a suborder within the Lophiiformes.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nCeratioidei takes its name from the genus Ceratias, the type genus of the family Ceratidae and of the suborder. Ceratias means \"horn bearer\", an allusion to the esca sticking up from the snout.\n\n\n== Families ==\n\nCeratioidei contains the following families:\n\nCaulophrynidae Goode & Bean, 1896 (Fanfins)\nNeoceratiidae Regan, 1926 (Spiny seadevils)\nMelanocetidae Gill, 1878 (Black seadevils)\nHimantolophidae Gill, 1861 (Footballfishes)\nDiceratiidae Regan & Trewavas, 1932 (Double anglers)\nOneirodidae Gill, 1878 (Dreamers)\nThaumatichthyidae Smith & Radcliffe, 1912 (Wolftrap anglers)\nCentrophrynidae Bertelsen, 1951 (Prickly seadevils)\nCeratiidae Gill, 1861 (Warty seadevils)\nGigantactinidae Boulenger, 1904 (Whipnose anglers)\nLinophrynidae Regan, 1925 (Leftvents)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Meshkeysor (Kazakh: Мешкейсор; Russian: Мешкейсор) is a salt lake in Ulytau District, Ulytau Region, Kazakhstan.\nAbilzhappas (Kazakh: Әбілжаппас), a wintering settlement (Kystau) of Kazakh herders, is located 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) to the northeast of the northern lakeshore. \n\n\n== Geography ==\nMeshkeysor is an endorheic lake in the Sarysu basin. The lake has a sinuous shape stretching roughly from east to west, surrounded by salt pans. The lake lies in the middle of the Meshkeysor region, a vast 8,100 square kilometers (3,100 sq mi) area characterized by flat valleys and \"melkosopochnik\" low hills. The altitude of this region lies between 400 meters (1,300 ft) and 500 meters (1,600 ft). It is limited by rivers Sary-Kengyr and Sarysu. \nLake Meshkeysor is located at the center in a trough of saline young soils and salt marshes. Karasor, a smaller lake, lies 16 kilometers (9.9 mi) to the SSE, and a very large reddish sor 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) to the northeast. Lake Kabyrshakty lies 66 kilometers (41 mi) to the southeast. \nMeshkeysor freezes in November and stays under ice until April. It fills during the spring thaw with a river flowing from the north and another flowing from the southwest. The lake usually dries completely during summer droughts.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\nThe steppe vegetation of the area is characterized by wormwood and fescue, with junegrass and feathergrass in the banks and higher grounds. In drainless troughs with saline soil there is  only wormwood and saltwort. The lake basin is a seasonal grazing ground for local cattle.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKazakh semi-desert\nList of lakes of Kazakhstan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Meshkeysor at Wikimedia Commons",

It is the official aid organisation of the Catholic Church in Mexico.\nThe organisation is a member of the global Caritas Internationalis confederation and of Caritas Latin America and Caribbean.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1971, Pope Paul VI established the Pontifical Council Cor Unum. Its goal was the coordination, promotion and intensification of the Catholic relief and assistance activities and organizations. One of the two members of the council was Adalberto Almeida y Merino, Archbishop of Chihuahua. He returned home to convince the Episcopal Conference of Mexico to create a national Caritas in Mexico, which was achieved in 1973.\nThe original purpose of Caritas Mexico was to serve as the federation of the Mexican diocesan Caritas organisations, as most Catholic dioceses had established their own Caritas. However, between 1979 and 1995, Caritas Mexico mainly provided emergency relief and social assistance. In 1997, its legal status changed and it became an Institución de Asistencia Privada (Private Assistance Institution). This allowed it to restore its original purpose as federation. In 2024, there were 62 diocesan Caritas branches operating in 30 Mexican states.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nCaritas Mexico consists of dozens of regional, independent Caritas organisations in Mexico, one in each of the Catholic dioceses of Mexico. They implement social projects locally. \nThe diocesan organisations are:\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Spanish)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "UE Bossòst is a Spanish football club based in Bossòst. The club currently competes in the Departmental 2, the 10th tier of football in France.\nU.E. Bossòst was founded between 1920 and 1927 (the date cannot be specified), and has always played in France since it was founded due to its geographical and social proximity.\nIt has no sponsor, it is financed with the fees of its approximately 160 members and with grants from the General Council of Aran. Also, with the sale of lottery numbers.\n\n\n== Team ==\nIt is the main team of the Vall d'Aran, especially after the disappearance of Vielha Club de Fùtbol (from Vielha). They play in the Departmental 2 – the 10th division of France. They also play in the French Cup, the most important competition of the season, in fact they could even reach the final, but usually they do not pass the second or third round. They have never played against a team in the professional division.\nOne of the main differences between the club is the diversity of languages spoken in the Bossòst dressing room – Aranese, Spanish, Catalan – while only French is spoken in the rival teams.\nIt also plays the Copa de Comminges, a tournament played by clubs from the divisions of the Comminges region, where U.E. Bossòst has been playing since the twenties. Bossòst has won this trophy on two occasions, the last time was in 2007.\n\n\n== Why UE Bossòst plays in France ==\nIn the first years of the team, they could not cross to the other side of the valley because of the snow, for this reason the football team of the Aran Valley plays in France. In fact, until they built the Vielha tunnel, they could not cross into Catalan territory during the winter.\n\n\n== References ==",

They soon begin arguing when Avigail discovers that Noam's ex-girlfriend, Renana have him an envelope with a ring. Elinor decides that in order to start their marriage off on the right foot, they must return the ring that same night. The wedding night, which was supposed to be sweet and romantic, turns into a sleepwalking journey around Jerusalem, which brings the couple together with past loves, repressed feelings and the single life they left behind.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nAvigail Harari as Elinor, a high school drama teacher and Noam's wife\nRan Danker as Noam, Elinor's husband\nOrly Silbersatz Banai as Noam's mother\nMeir Suissa as Noam's father\nElisha Banai as Michael, Elinor's ex-boyfriend and film student\nYael Folman as Renana, Noam's ex-girlfriend\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film received international premieres in the United States and the United Kingdom, as part of the Tribeca Film Festival in 2020 and the BFI London Film Festival in October of the same year.

Harari's image was defaced and Danker's was left intact. Merav Michaeli, the Minister of Transport, condemned the action: \" \"This is not modesty, this is violence. Vandalizing a sign with a woman's face on it is violence, no less than that... The forceful attempt to erase women and exclude them from the public sphere is devastating...I intend to convene the professionals from the Transportation Authority public in the office in order to find a way to fight and eradicate this inappropriate phenomenon.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHannah Brown of The Jerusalem Post, praised the film: \"This lively and engaging film is a black comedy that seems to be heavily influenced by the Martin Scorsese film After Hours. Mako described it as \"a love letter to Jerusalem\", concluding: \"Honeymood is nevertheless a smart, fluid, exciting and magical adventure film, and it is difficult to impossible to take your eyes off the screen while watching it.\" The Israeli newspaper, Calcalist praised Lavie's originality in playing with the romantic comedy genre: \"Lavie is literally reinventing a Hollywood genre here, with a rather cheeky Israeli patent.\" The newspaper concluded that the film has \"a funny and original creator [Lavie], with a complex view of life and characters who have layers of sadness and a sense of loss, but whose story is wrapped in punch lines and moments of slapstick who make this whole life seem tolerable, funny and wonderful.\"\nThe film received eight Ophir Award nominations:\n\nBest Actress (Avigail Harari)\nBest Supporting Actor (Meir Suissa)\nBest Supporting Actress (Orly Silbersatz Banai)\nBest Photography (Yaron Scharf)\nBest Makeup (Or Sapir)\nBest Costume Designe (Lital Goldfine)\nBest Art Direction (Ron Zikno)\n\n\n== External links ==\nHoneymood at IMDb \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The English Ladies Orchestral Society was one of the first and largest amateur ladies’ orchestra in the UK, founded in 1893. It had over 100 members, including a full band of wind and strings. The primary organisers were Mary Venables and\nMarian Arkwright. The conductor (a man) was Mr. J. S. Liddle, organist of St Nicholas' Parish Church in Newbury and also the conductor of the Newbury Choral Society from 1884 until his death in 1921. Liddle first organised a series concerts featuring orchestras for female players in 1877.  \nThe orchestra held its rehearsals in London, and concerts were often held in provincial towns, often in aid of charitable causes. Its first public concert was given at Chelmsford in 1893. One later concert, held in Leeds on 29 October 1903, featured Max Bruch's op. 28 Symphony conducted by Liddle, and Hubert Parry's Lady Radnor's Suite, conducted by the composer. The orchestra was still performing in 1910.\nOther ladies-only orchestras active during the same period included Helen Matilda Chaplin's string orchestra (founded in 1881 as the Lady Folkestone's Band and later as Lady Radnor's Band), the Aeolian Ladies' Orchestra (professional, founded 1886 by Rosabel Watson), Eleanor Clausen's Orchestra of Young Ladies (founded 1890, all Guildhall students), the Haresfoot Ladies' Band in Berkhampstead, the Lady William Lennox's Orchestra and Mrs. Hunt's Ladies' Orchestra. Partly due to a shortage of male musicians as war was declared, female musicians - including Rebecca Clarke (viola) and Jessie Grimson (violin) - were gradually admitted into mainstream, mixed professional orchestras such as Henry Wood's Queen's Hall Orchestra for the first time.\nThe Society of Women Musicians was founded in 1911. The London Women’s Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1922 by Elisabeth Kuyper. Gwynne Kimpton founded the British Women's Symphony Orchestra in 1923. Kathleen Riddick was the founder of the London Women's String Orchestra in 1938. In the US Ethel Leginska headed the Boston Woman's Symphony Orchestra (1926-1930), founded the National Women's Symphony Orchestra in New York in 1932 and served as director of the Chicago Women's Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n== References ==",

The play was presented by William Anderson who also did another play of Smith's The Girl of the Never Never. Smith said Anderson \"cast them well and produced them without stint.\" The play was a success in its original season.\nThe cast for the 1909 production included Bert Bailey and Edmund Duggan. The Bulletin thought the construction of the play was flimsy.\nThe play ran in 1913 under the title The Bush Girl.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewing a 1912 production Table Talk said \"the author has got\naway from the stage traditions which surround Australian plays. He has given a picture of lire on a country homestead among Australian\nfarmers and squatters-characteristic, natural and congenial. The plot is not too involved, and the dialogue is crisp and flowing with many passages of quick wit or quiet humor.\"\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Bushwoman at Ausstage\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Earl G. Bass (March 30, 1915 – September 18, 2002) was an American politician.\nEarl Bass was born in Strahan, Iowa, on March 30, 1915, to parents Zeno Bass Jr. and Rena Gipe. Earl Bass graduated from Strahan High School in 1932 and attended the University of Nebraska and Tarkio College. He married Tarkio classmate Helen Louise Christensen on September 1, 1943, in Pittsburg, Kansas. After the couple had graduated, they moved to Bass's hometown. They relocated to Malvern, Iowa, after the birth of their two daughters. Earl was active in Malvern's Methodist Church, became a founding member of the Mills County Extension Council in 1955, and helped organize the local Girl Scouts troop. In 1954, Bass acquired the local grain elevator. He also farmed and raised cattle.\nPolitically, Bass was affiliated with the Republican Party. An inaugural member of the Malvern village board, he also served on the Malvern School Board prior to the formal establishment of the Malvern Community School District in 1960. Bass defeated Otha Wearin in a 1969 special election for a vacated Iowa Senate seat. Bass took office in District 6 on November 18, 1969, and served until January 10, 1971, when he was redistricted to District 41. Bass stepped down from the Iowa Senate on January 7, 1973. In November 1972, Bass was elected to represent Mills County on the Health Planning Council of the Midlands. Bass endorsed Chuck Grassley's first campaign for the United States Senate in 1980.\nBass's first wife Helen died on June 11, 1994, and he subsequently remarried, to Marjorie Ruth Donner Dashner on March 18, 1995. Donner Dashner died on July 24, 1999, and Bass died on September 18, 2002.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Azerbaijani nomadic life- refers to the historical and contemporary practice of individuals or groups living a nomadic (tərəkəmə) or semi-nomadic (elat) lifestyle within the cultural environment of Azerbaijan, along with its historical, cultural, and customary aspects. Temporary dwellings used by nomads in Azerbaijan include various types such as \"oba, shenlik, sığırxana, yataq, binə, yurd, düşərgə, qışlaq, dəkkə, dəngə, yaylaq, etc\". During the summer season, nomadic homes such as \"alaçıq, coma, dəyə, muxuru, qarakeçə, dünnüklü ev, kolux, mağardəyə, etc.,\" are used.\nIn 2023, the cultural environment of nomadic life and the migration route in Azerbaijan were recognized as part of the World Heritage.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nElat: An Arabic-origin term used to describe nomadic peoples, many of whom are of Turkic descent, predominantly in Iran and Azerbaijan.\nTərəkəmə: Used in the 19th to early 20th centuries to refer to nomadic lifestyle, specifically among the Turkic peoples of Azerbaijan. In modern times, this term is used for tribes (tərəkəmələr, qarapapaqlar).\nTat: In its first meaning, used to refer to non-Turkic-speaking populations (Tats) in and outside Iranian Azerbaijan. In its second meaning, used to describe Turkic-speaking populations leading settled lives not affiliated with any tribe, observed only in Iranian Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== Physical and human geography ==\n\n\n=== Plains ===\n\nIn Azerbaijan, as in other Turkic-speaking regions, highland pastures used for nomadic animal husbandry are called \"yaylaq.\" Many of these yaylaqs are located at an altitude of up to 2800 meters above sea level. The ancient yaylaqs where sheep grazed were traditionally situated in the alpine and subalpine meadows of the Greater and Lesser Caucasus mountains. Yaylaq husbandry, known as a profession, emerged during the Early Bronze Age in the Transcaucasian region, particularly in modern Azerbaijan, and had formed by the early millennia BCE.\nYaylaq husbandry was primarily practiced by the population owning pasture lands in mountainous regions. Evidence of this can be seen in the form of cyclopean, sturdy stone structures built for seasonal habitation and defense against sudden attacks from neighboring tribes. Similar constructions to those inhabited by individuals engaged in animal husbandry during the Late Bronze Age can often be found in the yaylaqs of the Lesser Caucasus, such as Xaçbulaq, Kalbajar, Gadabay, Laçın, Batabat, as well as in the Ordubad mountains. Yaylaqs in Azerbaijan were extensively utilized until the 1980s.\nComparing archaeological data with the ethnography of Azerbaijan allows us to form an understanding of the nomadic migration pattern and the lifestyle in the yaylaq during ancient times. The population would gather their belongings onto carts and move along with their herds. Upon reaching the designated stop where the road turned into tracks, the property would be unloaded from the carts and loaded onto pack animals. According to historian Teymur Bunyadov, such movements to the yaylaq were already present during the Bronze Age.\nThe main reason for the settlement of Turks in Azerbaijan was the abundance of pastures, vineyards, and orchards, along with favorable conditions for animal husbandry. As a result, Azerbaijan and the region of Iraqi Azerbaijan became yaylaqs and qışlaqs for two million nomads.\n\n\n=== Historical migration routes ===\n\nThe nomadic routes of the Western region of Azerbaijan began with crossings over the Kura River and continued along the flatlands, switching to mountain trails upon reaching the yaylaqs. Since the Western region's nomadic routes crossed the Kura River, livestock and sheep were ferried across the river using small boats, hence the presence of sailors on the river. The winter quarters of the Western region were located in Garayazi and Jeyranchol, while the summer pastures were in the Shahdag and Murguz ranges. By the late 19th century, the main roads used by the nomads of Gazakh and Elisabethpol districts were primarily Yasamal, Zeyem Valley, Kiran, Sari Yoxush, Qosha Deyirman roads, the road leading to Qizilbulaq yaylaq, and Zada roads. Villagers in the Western region who used the yaylaqs (Poylu, Salahli, Kesaman, and Qarabagli) independently moved via the Jeyranchol-Qedili pass, Annefeld, the German colony, to Morul village, and from there to the yaylaqs via the Yasamal road. In the Shusha district, there were two nomadic routes: along the Kura River, through the Asgeran Valley to Qirqqiz yaylaq, and the road from Khachin to Aylishli, Shusha village, and Kirs mountain. The inhabitants of Javanshir district also used the latter route.\nThe migration routes of the Shirvan nomads extended from the Küdru winter quarters to the Great Caucasus summer pastures. The directions of these nomadic routes are as follows: Hərmidağ—Paşalı—Udulu—Yavannı mountain—Mərəzə—Hilmilli—Dibrar, Girdə-Pirsaat valley—Təsi village—Sündüqozlu river—Dibrar, Kələqaya (Döymə road)—Ləngəbiz—Çarhan—Mərzəndigə—Kurdamir—Astraxanka—Sarıdaş yaylaq (Dibrar), Gödəkambarə winter quarters—Kolanı—Göylər—Ortabulaq valley—Shamakhi—Pirsaat valley—Çaylı village—Kurdamir—Astraxanka—Dibrar.\nThe summer pastures for the Mugan nomads were the Savalan, Qaradag, and Talysh mountains. The migration routes to the Savalan pastures included Bilasuvar—Bagrovdag—Agh evlər—Gəlin yurdu—Xatınbulaq—Qaraşiran direction. The Shahseven nomads, especially the Meşkin communities, utilized these routes when migrating to the pastures: Downstream of the Araz river—Xoruzlu mountain range—Bərzəng river, Ziyvə village (Mugan)—Sambur river—Ləngənd—Savalan, Upper reaches of the Qarasu river, Göytəpə-Səfidağ area—Talysh mountains—Çiçəkli mountain range.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn the 19th to early 20th centuries, the term \"terekeme\" was used to refer to nomads. A.D. Yeritsov noted that the term \"terekeme\" was not used to denote a specific ethnicity or tribe; rather, it was attributed to all Azerbaijani Turks. The terekeme (nomadic) tribes recorded in the Gazakh district and other districts included various groups such as Ayrımlı, Bayat, Qədirli, Qaraqoyunlu, Qaraxanlı, Kengerli, Salaxlı, Sofulu, and Tatlı. According to N.A. Abelova, the local population referred to nomadic tribes (such as those in the Goychay and Shamakhi districts) as terekeme or nomads.\nBefore the emergence of Azerbaijani national identity, inhabitants who led a semi-nomadic lifestyle and preserved patriarchal-tribal relations would identify themselves based on their tribe or ancestral affiliation (such as Avshars, Tekellers, Kengerlis, Ayrums, etc.). In Soviet Azerbaijan, there were four nomadic groups (Ayrımlar, Padarlar, Shahsevens, Qarapapaqs). Ayrımlar lived in the western part of Azerbaijan, while Shahsevens resided in the south of Azerbaijan along the Iranian border.\nThe fact that the summer pastures of the Saxurs were in Dagestan while their winter quarters were in Azerbaijan contributed to the Saxur-Azerbaijani bilingualism (Saxurs speaking their own language along with Azerbaijani). Russian-Swedish officer Ivan Gerber noted that the nomadic Arabs residing in Mugan during the winter months spoke in a \"mixed Turkic-Arabic language.\"\n\n\n=== Karabakh conflict ===\nIn the early 20th century, Zangezur served as a strategic corridor connecting Eastern Transcaucasia, Iravan Province, and Nakhchivan. In 1916, there were 120,000 Muslims and 101,000 Armenians living in the region (except for Azerbaijani shepherds from Karabakh's mountainous regions who migrated to the plains of Zangezur during the summer). A significant portion of Muslims resided in border areas. According to the administrative-territorial reform proposed by the Armenian side, except for the nomads, it was envisaged that 88,000 Armenians and 46,000 Muslims living in central Zangezur would be separated from the other peripheral areas of Zangezur.\nKarabakh nomads were engaged in pastoralism, and their settlements depended on the high mountain pastures of Karabakh's mountainous regions. They traversed to these areas during the summer, crossing through the territories of the local population. The division of Karabakh's plains and mountainous regions between Azerbaijan and Armenia meant deprivation of the Azerbaijani nomads from summer pastures. The solutions proposed by Armenia—organizing irrigation works in Azerbaijani desert areas, migrating to new pastures in the north of Azerbaijan, or signing a special interstate agreement allowing nomads to use \"Armenian\" pastures in Karabakh—were not acceptable to Azerbaijan.\nAccording to the report of Khosrov bey Sultanov on June 21, 1919, due to Armenian control of mountain passes in Karabakh, the 10,000 Muslim nomads with 150,000 head of livestock could not access summer pastures. Sultanov requested permission from the government to fulfill his duty towards tens of thousands of people. In 1922, according to the report of Gazanfar Musabekov, due to the Azerbaijan-Armenia war (1918–1920), nomads were unable to use summer pastures, leading to many deaths from malaria among both people and livestock.\n\n\n== Residential settlements ==\n\nThe temporary residential settlements used by the nomads (semi-nomads) included \"oba\", \"şenlik\", \"sığırxana\", \"yataq\", \"binə\", \"yurd\", \"düşərgə\", \"qışlaq\", \"dəkkə\", \"dəngə\", \"yaylaq\", etc. During the establishment of the encampments, the dwellings of the tribal leader or elder (ağsaqqal) were placed in the center, surrounded by close relatives, while in the pastures, the makeshift shelters of the grazing shepherds and humble families were set up.\nThe \"oba\" was formed in connection with the migration of livestock farming to winter and summer pastures, divided into small units called \"dəngələr\" and separated from each other by pastures called \"otarası\". In the 19th century, although the \"oba\" was used by both livestock owners and settled residents, it gradually turned into a permanent residential settlement—a village.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, N. A. Abelov noted that the nomadic communities inhabited by different generations and groups (tribes, clans) were referred to as \"şenlik\" by Muslims. The \"şenlik\" was relatively smaller in size compared to the \"oba\" and often served as a temporary gathering place.\nIn the mountainous regions of Azerbaijan during the 19th century, the predominant type of settlement found in many villages was the \"binə\" structure (consisting of a bed, table, platform, hearth, and roof). As the \"binə\" expanded, residential houses were built, gradually turning it into a permanent living area. The \"binə\" was named after the first settler or the name of the livestock farming areas (such as Qasımbinəsi, Malbinəsi, Qoyunbinəsi, etc.).\nLivestock nomads spent 8–9 months of the year in winter pastures and 3–4 months in summer pastures. Winter pastures differed from other residential settlements in terms of permanence and were considered the final stage of transition to village life. Examples of such settlements in Azerbaijan include Böyükqışlaq (Tovuz), Köhəqışlaq (Laçın), Qışlaq (Laçın), Köhəqışlaq (Qazax), Düzqışlaq (Qazax), Yayqışlaq (Daşkəsən), Günqışlaq (Zəngilan), Aydınqışlaq (Qəbələ), and Başqışlaq (Goranboy).\nThe selection of summer pastures where nomads stayed was based on proximity to water sources and kinship relations. Summer pastures where several generations of related families stayed for several years were named after the family head and the villages where the nomads originated (such as Əmirəhmədin yurdu, Nəbi yurdu, Eldar yaylağı, etc.).\n\n\n=== Temporary Residential settlements ===\nIn Azerbaijan, the types of houses used during the summer pasture season include \"alaçıq,\" \"coma,\" \"dəyə,\" \"muxuru,\" \"qarakeçə,\" \"dünnüklü ev,\" \"kolux,\" \"mağardəyə,\" and others. Among these, \"dəyə\" (known as \"qarakeçə\" in Shirvan) and \"alaçıq\" have been more commonly used. There is a difference in size and solidity between the two. Depending on the size of the \"dəyə,\" it requires 30-50 poles and 4-6 felts (called \"qəlib\"). The felts are prepared by skilled craftsmen known as \"həllac.\"\n\n\n== Employment ==\nWhen choosing a bride among the herders, her weaving skills were especially taken into account. The weaving frame used in weaving was the most suitable type of frame for the nomadic household moving between winter and summer pastures. Except for the part called \"qılınc\" (sword), it was possible to replace the remaining parts of the weaving frame with branches and materials.\nThe Fars province group of the Baharlu, an ethnographic group of Azerbaijanis, lived a nomadic lifestyle until 1860, but due to the decrease in population resulting from massacres, it was decided that the tribal population was not suitable for long seasonal migrations. The Baharlu settled in winter quarters and began to make a living from agriculture and animal husbandry, as well as from handicrafts.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nAzerbaijan's material culture is the result of a subtle blend of symbiosis, local elements, and the contributions of migrants that have continued over the centuries. Depictions of sheep and goats in Azerbaijani carpets are indicative of a certain tribe's nomadic past.\nIn Iranian Azerbaijan, there are minor differences between nomadic and settled communities in dialects, religious beliefs, customs such as oral literature, and rituals belonging to various periods of human life. Although a systematic comparison of the regional Azerbaijani Turkic dialects has not been published, there is evidence in some aspects, such as the melodic harmony, that nomadic individuals in Iranian Azerbaijan speak a \"cleaner\" Turkish compared to their settled Turkish-speaking (Tati) neighbors.\nWhile the mutual assistance form called \"ziyanlıq\" has formed in village communities in Azerbaijan, it has also passed down to the nomadic population through interdependence. Ivar Lassi, who studied the privacy customs of Azerbaijani Turks, likened the tents used by the Turkestan nomads to the \"pirlər\" (small tents). He noted that the forms of the pirlər and the openings in their upper parts are evidence of the preservation of nomadic Turkic architecture.\nAzerbaijani nomadic dance reflects pastoral dance elements. Related to totemism in nomadic choreography, movements and rituals specific to animals demonstrate the archaic nature of the dance. In modern times, classic European and Asian wrestling traditions influenced by local wrestling customs exist among Azerbaijan's local communities and nomads.\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\nThe art of Azerbaijani Ashiq combines poetry, storytelling, dance, and vocal-instrumental music, embodying the unity of poetical expression, storytelling, dance, and vocal-instrumental music. It is the continuation of the tradition of poets from ancient times, who later, under the influence of Uyghur-Mongolian and eventually Islamic culture, became known as Ashiqs, poet-musicians among the ancient Oghuz people. The arrival of Oghuz tribes to Iran and the South Caucasus territories after the Mongol invasion further strengthened these traditions. The prevalence of nomadic life among all Oghuz tribes in Iran, Iraq, and Eastern Anatolia significantly influenced the vitality and purity of these ancient traditions and narratives.\nThe epic \"Kitabi-Dede Korkut\" narrates the battles fought by Oghuz heroes in the Caucasus territories against the \"infidels.\" Although its origins lie in Central Asia, it took shape in Azerbaijan, where the Oghuz people were densely settled. The final version of the epic was recorded in the modern Azerbaijani territory in the 15th century. The Dresden manuscript is in Azerbaijani, while the Vatican manuscript is in Anatolian Turkish.\nThe verses of the \"Sayaçı\" are a shining example of the literary creativity of Azerbaijani nomadic Turkic culture. During the winter and towards autumn, the Sayaçı would travel from village to village, soothing the souls of the nomads with their verses and collecting flour, cheese, wheat, barley, sheep, etc., in return. The verses of the Sayaçı are considered by the nomads as symbols of happiness and good fortune.\n\n\n== Craftsmanship ==\nThe product made from pressed felt, called \"qelib,\" had various types, such as \"head qelib,\" \"side qelib,\" and \"door qelib.\" It required about 6 qelibs (head qelib) to cover the top of a felt tent. Additionally, a \"door qelib\" was applied to the tent's entrance. Generally, each felt tent required a total of 12-13 qelibs. Pressed felt without a frame, as well as felt made by tailors, was used by nomads, shepherds, and poor people.\nThe fur coat worn by nomadic herders was made from sheepskin with 4-5 layers of wool and remained unadorned. A felt coat, specifically for men, was a common seasonal garment. A \"long-neck\" coat (extending to the knees) was a distinctive feature among wealthy nomadic men.\nTo ensure comfort while riding horses and walking during migrations, nomadic women tied a \"badisha\" (a wrap without soles) with a \"katma\" (a tied cloth) inside their woolen socks within the felt boots. In rainy weather or during horse riding, Shirvan nomadic women adjusted the back of their wide cloak by pulling it forward between the layers, creating a makeshift cape to provide extra coverage. Wealthy nomadic women wore long-neck coats when embarking on a journey.\nIn the lives of nomadic herders, leather pouches were indispensable items.\n\n\n=== Food ===\n\nMountain-dwelling nomadic herders had more meat and dairy-based meals in their diet compared to plant-based meals. Among them, preserving meat by frying was common. Dishes such as skewered kebabs, ground meat kebabs, grilled kebabs, stuffed kebabs, fried chicken, braised dishes, liver dishes, fried dishes, stews, stuffed vegetables, fried foods, soups, meat and vegetable stew, boiled meat, stone-cooked meat, and stew in a pot were widespread.\nGriddle cakes were preferred among their bread options. A characteristic dish among nomads was a stew prepared from boiled meat and freshly milked dairy. Meals typically included dairy products (yogurt, cheese, cream, butter), and sometimes hot dishes.\n\n\n== Folk calendar ==\n\nThe Qarayaz period posed challenges for the semi-nomadic herding population. Proverbs like \"When Novruz arrives, it's summer, even if there are only 40 logs,\" or \"After the holiday, 40 logs will burn\" were not relevant during this time. The Qarayaz period was referred to by the herders as \"restless,\" \"unstable,\" or \"erratic.\" The term \"erratic\" is associated with the inability of the livestock to rest due to insufficient grazing. The term \"restless\" implies the weakness of the livestock due to inadequate nutrition, preventing them from staying in one place.\nDue to the scarcity of pasture during the Qarayaz period, nomadic herders had to preserve their reserves (food, flour, straw) and avoid venturing into the desert. There's a saying: \"If Qarayaz becomes agitated, you need 40 bundles of firewood and 40 sacks of straw.\" According to the song \"The exchange between Qarayaz and March,\" March was particularly harsh, and hunger was widespread. During such times, the herding community would express their concern upon seeing the southern slopes covered in snow.\nDuring the Quyruqdoğdu period, herders would position their sheep behind a ridge or hill to shield them from the light of the stars. According to belief, the light of the stars causes animals to shed their wool. In the Azerbaijani folk calendar, the Quyruqdoğdu period is also referred to as \"quyruqdondu.\" The explanation for this is that during this period, shepherds melt fat in the mountains and preserve it in the desert. If the fat freezes the next day, cold weather begins in the mountains, signaling the end of the warm season.\nThe Elqovan period is named after the practice of searching for those remaining in the highlands. The saying \"When Elqovan comes, it's time to migrate\" originates from this. When migrating from the highlands to the lowlands, a container consisting of butter churns is prepared after dismantling the yurt or tent. The container is thrown around the tent three times, first butter is thrown, then water is sprinkled over it.\nThe period when sheep are released into the flock by the herding community is called \"Gochgarishan.\" Herders consider this time to fall in the last month of winter. Sheep are inspected, sheep fights are held, and prizes are awarded to the best sheep owners. Later, the sheep are released into the flock. If a white sheep joins the flock, it means that winter will be snowy and cold. If a red sheep comes, winter will not be too cold, and if a black sheep comes, it will be mild.\n\n\n=== Iranian Azerbaijanis ===\nIn Iranian Azerbaijan, various ceremonies and festivals are celebrated with names like Mountain Migration, Shepherd's Festival, Sheep Day, Shepherds' Day, Grass Migration, and Lamb Day.\n\nSheep Day: This ceremony was performed after the first birth in the sheep flock. Shepherds would dance and sing songs, and competitions would be held.\nLamb Day: This festival took place ten days before migrating to the highlands. The young men would receive advice from the head shepherd or the leader of the community. The sheep would be adorned with various colored wool and bells would be hung around their necks.\nGrass Migration: This event was held to mark the completion of agricultural and village work. During this traditional temporary migration, the elderly, children, and livestock would be taken to the highlands.\n\n\n=== Georgian Azerbaijanis ===\nIn the village of Armudlu in Dmanisi, Georgia, when Azerbaijani nomads return from the mountains to the plains, Elat Bayramı is celebrated on July 26. During this time, tents are set up, horse races are held, and bread is prepared. In the summer season, beekeepers also go up to the highlands because special flowers grow there, especially in cooler areas.\n\n\n== Description in culture ==\nAbdulla Şaiq's work \"Köç\" depicts nomadic life, folk customs, neighbors in the highlands, entertainment, and games, as well as the love for the highlands. The sections of the work include \"Our Migration to the Highlands,\" \"Camp,\" \"Kərim Baba and Ayrım's Daughter,\" \"Pələng Ovu,\" and \"Sümsü.\"\nThe film \"Çölçü,\" produced in 2012, explores the encounter between a boy living in the ancient world of the desert and a girl representing the modern world.\n\n\n== UNESCO registration ==\nThe examples of intangible cultural heritage included in UNESCO's list in Azerbaijan under the theme of \"Migration\" or \"Nomadic Culture\" are: 1) Azerbaijani ashig art, 2) The heritage of Dede Korkut, including epic culture, legends, and music, 3) The game of Chovgan played with Karabakh horses, and 4) The cultural practice of preparing and sharing lavash.\nIn 2023, the cultural environment and migration route of the Khinalug people were registered as UNESCO World Heritage. This cultural environment includes the mountainous village of Khinalug in northern Azerbaijan, mountain pastures and rural areas in the Greater Caucasus mountains, as well as winter pastures in the central plains of Azerbaijan connected by a 200-kilometer migration route. The semi-nomadic lifestyle and culture of the Khinalug residents are characterized by seasonal migration between pastures and winter camps. This migration network includes temporary pastures and enclosures, as well as shrines and mosques.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nK.Koshkarli (1992). \"Nomads and Azerbaijan\".

Its leaves are mostly 5–7 mm (0.20–0.28 in) long with about 3 to 7 usually narrowly lance-shaped leaflets, the side leaflets 10–25 mm (0.39–0.98 in) long and 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) wide with stipules 2–6 mm (0.079–0.236 in) long at the base of the petioles. The flowers are arranged in racemes up to 50–150 mm (2.0–5.9 in) long with up to 3 to about 16 flowers on a peduncle 0.5–2 mm (0.020–0.079 in) wide, each flower about 7–10 mm (0.28–0.39 in) long on a hairy pedicel 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079 in) long. The sepals are joined at the base, forming a tube about 2 mm (0.079 in) long, the sepal lobes longer than the tube. The petals are purple, the standard petal about 8–10 mm (0.31–0.39 in) long and wide, the wings 7–8 mm (0.28–0.31 in) long, and the keel 8–10 mm (0.31–0.39 in) long and 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) deep. Flowering occurs from April to August or September and the fruit is oblong, about 10–15 mm (0.39–0.59 in) and about 4 mm (0.16 in) wide.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nSwainsona paucifoliolata was first formally described in 1993 by Joy Thompson in the journal Telopea from a specimen collected near Meekatharra in 1957. The specific epithet (paucifoliolata) means \"few leaflets\".\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThis species of swainsona grows in creeklines, claypans and soakage areas in the Little Sandy Desert, Murchison, Pilbara and Yalgoo bioregions of northern Western Australia.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\nSwainsona paucifoliolata is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.\n\n\n== References ==",

The game was released through Steam's early access program in April 2024.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nRotwood is a beat 'em up video game set in a 2.5D environment. The game allows players to fight against corrupted beasts with a wide range of gears and weapons, both of which can be upgraded extensively. Each character has access to light and heavy attacks, though movements can be chained together to form combos. Rotwood is divided into different biomes. To unlock the next biome, all the boss characters in the preceding biome must be defeated. Players will be offered upgrade choices after the completion of each biome, which enables them to become more efficient in combat in subsequent enemy encounters. The game supports four-player cooperative multiplayer.\n\n\n== Development ==\nRotwood was announced by Klei Entertainment in June 2022. It was released through Steam's early access program on April 24, 2024. The early access version of the game includes four biomes and four weapon classes at launch. It attracted more than 200,000 players by April 28. Klei expected the game to remain in early access for about one to two years.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is located 655 million light-years from the Solar System and has an approximate diameter of 75,000 light-years.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nPGC 3092152 is a recent galaxy merger with a tail-like feature extending from it. Because the Universe ages, galaxy-galaxy interactions have occurred and caused the stellar component of galactic discs to be disrupted to the point it enhances the star formation rate.Molecular components are disrupted as well, leading to a magnitude increase in star formation efficiency with more production of massive stars.  The galaxy merger causes the gas supply to be used up causing no new stars to be formed leaving the current star population to become older as the merged galaxy creeps into old age. PGC 3092152 is an example which marks a transitional phrase from a young, star-forming galaxy to become a massive, red and dead galaxy.\nOne of the possible reasons why star formation stopped, might be an overfed black hole. Like most galaxies, PGC 3092152 has a supermassive black hole – a powerful beast millions to billions more massive than the sun. During the galaxy merger, gas and dust are driven to the center to make young stars and feed the growing black hole. The sudden burst of activity creates an unstable environment causing shockwaves to swept through the galaxy. It ejects large quantities of gas which is sufficiently powerful enough to hinder the galaxy's ability to make new stars like in this case of PGC 3092152.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The term iron frame describes the structural use of either cast iron or wrought iron in the columns and beams of a building. While popular in the 19th century, the iron frame was displaced by the steel frame in the early 20th century.\n\n\n== Cast iron ==\n\nColumns made of cast iron were introduced in 1770s, the first building with multiple storeys using cast iron for both columns and beams is the Ditherington Flax Mill in Shrewsbury (1797). Columns were joined usually at the floor level and sometimes bolted together, the longer beams were made of sections that were also kept together by bolts. At first,  the stiffness of the frame was achieved through the use of masonry that filled the openings in the frame, but since 1844, a rigid frame was used that was stable by itself (former fire station at the Portsmouth Dockyard).\nWith its high compression strength, the cast iron is well-suited for columns. At first, the cruciform profile was used, later displaced by the hollow round shape and H-beams. Relative tensile weakness made the cast iron not the best choice for the beams and girders, this was compensated by making the bottom flange of an I-beam (the one experiencing the tension) much wider than the top, compressed, one and varying the beam profile to be wider at the middle, where the stress was higher. Cast iron was rapidly replaced in the beams by the wrought iron in the mid-19th century, the process had accelerated after the Dee Bridge disaster of 1847.\n\n\n== Wrought iron ==\nUse of wrought iron in construction has a long history (cramps made from wrought iron were used in classical antiquity). The first all-wrought iron roof was apparently installed in 1837 at the Euston railway station in London.\n\nBeams and girders were made of wrought iron with I-beam cross-section. The material was rarely used for the columns, as the cast was both stronger under compression and cheaper, so a typical iron frame building in the second half of the 19th century had cast iron columns and wrought iron beams. Columns at the Crystal Palace (1851), as well as short trusses, were made from the cast iron, while longer beams used wrought iron. A less-known precursor to the modern steel frame construction, the four-storey Boat Store (\"Shed 78\", 1858–1860), has its rigid frame constructed also from cast iron columns and wrought iron girders. With no internal walls and external walls made from sheet metal, the stability of this structure is provided exclusively through the rigid column-beam joints.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBussell, Michael (2008-04-15). \"Use of Iron and Steel in Buildings\".

        "content": "Josue N. Bellosillo (born November 13, 1933) is a former associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. He was sworn in as a member of the Supreme Court by President Corazon Aquino on March 3, 1992, and served until his retirement on November 13, 2003. He served as associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines for a period of eleven years. He also served as chief justice in an acting capacity several times during his tenure as Senior Associate Justice.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Capiz (now Roxas), Capiz on November 13, 1933, Bellosillo finished his elementary education at the Capiz Elementary School and his secondary education at the Colegio de la Purisima Concepcion. He obtained his pre-law degree and law degree from the University of the Philippines College of Law at UP Diliman where he graduated in 1957. During this time, he also joined the Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity in 1952.\nAfter working as a lawyer, Bellosillo first became a judge in 1971, when he sat in the Court of Agrarian Reform in Iloilo. After serving as a judge in other courts in Iloilo, Rizal and Pasig, he became Administrator and Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals from 1986 to 1991. In 1992, he was appointed by President Corazon Aquino as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines and subsequently became senior associate justice, standing in for Chief Justice Hilario Davide during times of temporary vacancies. He retired in 2003 and was replaced by Minita Chico-Nazario.\nIn 2003, Bellosillo was among eight Supreme Court justices who were subjected to an impeachment complaint filed by former president Joseph Estrada over their role in his ouster during the Second EDSA Revolution, when they appeared at the inauguration of his vice president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, and subsequently ruled in favor of upholding her assumption of the presidency.\nSince his retirement, Bellosillo has served as dean of the Centro Escolar University School of Law and Jurisprudence and has authored books on legal practice. He has also served as vice chairman and corporate counsel of Philtrust Bank.\n\n\n== Works ==\nEffect Pre-Trial Technique (1990, republished 2011)\nOmnibus Election Code with Rules of Procedure & Jurisprudence in Election Law (with Midas Marquez and Emmanuel Mapili, 2007)\nFundamentals of Nursing Law, Jurisprudence & Ethics (with Midas Marquez, Mapili and Eufemeia Octaviano, 2008)\nFundamentals of Dental Jurisprudence, Ethics & Practice Management (with Emmanuel Mapili and  Leonor Tripon-Rosero, 2009)\nLeave us alone (2009)\nBasics of Philippine Medical Jurisprudence & Ethics (with Emmanuel Mapili, Castro, Albert Rebosa, and Antonio Rebosa, 2010)\nIntroduction to Nursing Jurisprudence, Ethics, Leadership and Management (with Midas Marquez, Emmanuel Mapili and Lucia Basilonia-Simon, 2011)\nEffective Litigation & Adjudication of Election Contests (with Midas Marquez and Emmanuel Mapili, 2012)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAssociate Justice Josue N.

        "content": "The Network (stylized as network) is an American ad-supported video on-demand (AVOD) over-the-top streaming media service owned and operated by The Boathouse through its BH Media Holdings subsidiary. The Network primarily airs original TV series and positions itself as a \"premium\" service akin to its linear and streaming competitors. Registration is required to view The Network's programming, but there are no subscription fees.\nThe Network officially launched in the United States on April 30, 2024 with 2 original TV shows The Green Veil and Chivalry.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Network platform was created by Aram Rappaport, founder of the creative advertising agency The Boathouse with backing from BH Media Holdings. The service will release two originals at a time: dramas on Tuesdays and comedies on Thursdays.\nAram Rappaport further explained that The Network “seeks to declutter the streaming experience, eliminating audiences’ endless scrolling to find appealing series and films” and is “built on the principle ‘Always Originals, Always Free.'”\nRappaport also said of the streaming service, “The Network is providing a solution for consumers that feel overwhelmed by the excess of unnecessary content.

        "earliest_creation_date": "2024-04-24 19:47:11",
        "content": "Harold Halibut is a 2024 video game developed by German independent developer Slow Bros for Windows, the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5. The game is a narrative-based adventure video game in which players control Harold, a janitor on a spacecraft submerged in an alien planet, and complete odd tasks for the ship's inhabitants. The game was created over a ten-year development process, first conceived as an unfunded part-time project to create a narrative game inspired by stop-motion animation. To implement a stop-motion aesthetic, the developers hand-made characters, objects and environments using various materials scanned into the game and animated in the Unity engine. During development, the game received several features, nominations and accolades for video game, film and culture festivals. Upon release, Harold Halibut received mixed to average reviews, with critics praising the ambition and detail of the game's visual presentation and the themes in its narrative, although critiquing the game's narrative focus as lacking puzzles and interactivity and having a slow pace. \n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game's adventure gameplay is a linear, story-driven experience that takes place across six chapters. Players navigate the interior districts of the Fedora and interact or overhear conversations from its characters to progress the story. Characters provide the players with tasks, some necessary to complete the game and others optional, which are logged as a to-do list in a PDA menu. Completion of tasks requires simple point-and-click interactions with objects in the game, with some tasks involving small puzzles or minigames, such as cleaning a room through a Tetris-based minigame. Optional interactive minigames can be played in an arcade on the Fedora.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the peak of the Cold War in the 1970s, the space ship Fedora I, controlled by the All Water corporation, was sent from Earth to find a planet for humankind to colonise. Drifting for over two hundred years, the ship encounters a solar flare and is stranded at the bottom of an alien ocean on an uninhabitable planet, where it has remained for another fifty years. The player is Harold, a shy and withdrawn maintenance worker on the staff of the ship, who assists the scientist Jeanna Mareaux, who is commissioned to look for ways to escape the planet. Harold also performs odd jobs for the other inhabitants, many with different philosophies, including their views on whether to leave the Fedora or stay. When a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to relaunch the craft unaffected by the solar flare and return to home is discovered, Harold is placed in a unique position to make a difference in the future of the ship and its populace. During the game, Harold discovers a fish-like humanoid stuck in the ship's filtration system he names 'Fishy', providing him with a window into the perspective of the alien life on the planet. Harold also discovers the original mission of the Fedora may not have been as essential as its inhabitants believe. \n\n\n== Development and release ==\n\nHarold Halibut was created by Slow Bros., a Cologne studio led by independent developer Onat Hekimoğlu, a filmmaker and graduate of the Cologne Game Lab. The development process for the game took place over ten years, with the development team first working on the game on a part-time basis with low funding, and developing in size and commitment as a full-time project over time. In 2012, the initial three-person development team conceived the idea from a conversation about the potential to create a narrative-led video game using stop-motion animation, citing inspiration from classic adventure games and films including Jason and the Argonauts and The Valley of Gwangi. The team also were interested in the use of hand-made assets and stop-motion as they lacked experience in 3D modelling, preferring to leverage their skills of carpentry, sculpture, lighting and costume design to create a game.\nTo create and animate the assets for the game, the development team hand-made puppets, sets, props and costumes, from various materials including clay, textiles, welded metal, and recycled wood. These items were then rendered in 3D using photogrammetry by photographing the objects from all angles, animated as \"digitally rigged\" puppets and imported into the Unity engine. To animate the characters, motion capture was used through a motion tracking rig, which filmed the movements of actors and fit them to the models of the 3D puppets. This approach was taken instead of the originally intended approach of using stop-motion animation for characters to streamline the production process, as art director Ole Tillman stated the original approach was \"too restrictive\" and time-consuming. Hekimoğlu estimated that the production process required 200 kilograms of clay. Originally conceived to be more reliant on puzzles, Hekimoğlu stated that this approach was abandoned for a more narrative and linear one to focus on player immersion and interaction with the characters and world, taking influence from other narrative games including Night in the Woods and Firewatch.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nIn June 2017, the studio launched a failed Kickstarter to secure $170,000 in funding for development, with Hekimoğlu considering the campaign a success in terms of raising awareness for the game, but attributing its failure to the lack of initial promotion. Harold Halibut was announced at the Gamescom Future Games show on 22 March 2024 with a showcase trailer and release date, and published on Steam on 16 April.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAccording to review aggregator Metacritic, Harold Halibut received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics.\nReviewers praised the visual presentation of the game, also noting its scope and ambition. Describing the graphics as a \"monument to craft\", Edge noted the game's \"remarkable technical wizardry\" and \"authentically traditional\" design, comparing it to Aardman stop-motion animation. Rollin Bishop of GamesRadar+ praised the \"charming\" models for their \"tangible\" design and meticulous attention detail, although finding the models to have \"awkward\" and unintended movements in their animation. Describing the game's visuals as an \"undeniable technical achievement\", Daniel Bueno of Siliconera commended the game's \"unique\" visuals for their \"crisp look\". \nCritics expressed generally positive views about the game's narrative and characterisation. Harold Goldberg of the New York Times considered the game's story to have a \"honesty, empathy and a subtle mastery of human nature that isn’t present in many games\". Rollin Bishop of GamesRadar+ found the story to be \"surprisingly poignant\" in addition to expectedly \"unusual and funny\" aspects of the game. Alice Bell of Rock Paper Shotgun found the characters charmingly odd and the game replete with \"strange little interactions\", viewing the story as \"heartwarming\" and \"quietly triumphant\". Meg Pelliccio of TheGamer highlighted the game's \"fulfilling\" narrative and emotional breadth, citing the many \"moments of sadness, bittersweet closure, mystery, or simply a scene so surreal or stylish it stays with you\". Describing the game as \"thoughtful\", Lucas White of Shacknews found the game's themes around Harold's personal growth as \"compelling\", and praised the \"hopeful\" tone of the game, although considering the sinister undertones of the game \"fizzle into dead ends at times\". Despite \"flashes of brilliance\" and \"affection for its characters\", Joshua Wolens of PC Gamer considered the dialog to \"drag on\" and compromise the hints of \"daring\" and \"genuinely funny\" subject matter. Edge believed the game featured a \"satisfying conclusion\", although expressing that it could have had \"sharper\" dialogue and humor. Katharine Castle of Rock Paper Shotgun also critiqued Harold as a \"vacant and disinterested human being\" and the cruelty and pointlessness of other characters' initial interactions with him. \nCritics noted the game lacked conventional gameplay features for an adventure game, such as puzzles, due to the narrative focus of the game. Describing the game as a \"light experience\", Daniel Bueno of Siliconera considered Harold Halibut to lack a \"hands-on\" approach, lacking more puzzles or interaction, but believed these to be unnecessary for a narrative game. Lucas White of Shacknews noted that the game did not feature conventional puzzles, branching paths or multiple endings. Matt Gardner of Forbes stated that the gameplay puzzles were rare and short-lived, lacked nuance and skill, and were inconsistent with the narrative, also critiquing the \"identical and surprisingly poor\" arcade games. \nSeveral reviewers critiqued the slow pacing of the game. Alice Bell of Rock Paper Shotgun stated the game as \"inexplicably\" long and understood why players could consider it boring due to its \"very slow\" pace. Similarly, Katharine Castle of Rock Paper Shotgun noted the slow walking and running speed contributed to this pace. Edge stated that the \"drudgery\" of playing the character tested their tolerance for fetch quests, citing the lack of interactivity, long dialogue, and limited player agency in the story. Joshua Wolens of PC Gamer critiqued the game's \"strictly narrative\" focus as \"ponderous\" and \"fatiguing\", citing the \"long, barren stretches\" of gameplay between interesting sequences. Rollin Bishop of GamesRadar+ similarly considered the game to feature too much walking. Describing the game as an \"unexciting slog\" and \"repetitive\", Willa Rowe of Kotaku stated that the game \"never fully breaks out of its mundanity\", citing the focus on \"boring chores\" and the lack of a sense of urgency.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nHarold Halibut received nominations accolades in several game and film festivals, including nominations for the 'Most Wanted' and 'Best Marketing' at the 2017 Deutscher Entwicklerpreis, one of the winners of the German Government's 2019 Cultural and Creative Industries Kultur- und Kreativpiloten Deutschland award, the winner of the 'video game' category in the 2022 San Francisco Frozen Film Festival, and nominations for the 'Critic's Choice' and 'Most Anticipated Game' categories for the 2023 Indie Cup Germany.

From Gabonese and Colombian descent, she has been part of Profetas since 2001.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAntombo was born to Jean Langangui Alana, a Gabonese diplomat, and Elbadina Barahona Quiñónez, a Colombian chef from Rincón Hondo, Cesar, who met in Venezuela where Langangui was the Gabonese ambassador. Langangui and Barahona had two daughters, Ossengue (born in Venezuela) and Antombo; Langangui adopted Barahona's children born in Colombia, Alba Inés and Omar.\nIn the late 1980s Antombo's parents would be diagnosed with HIV; her mother took her four children to Colombia and her father would pass away in Africa. The family first arrived to Rincón Hondo and later would move to Bogotá, where Ossengue and Antombo would be enrolled at the Lycée français and live in Rosales, an exclusive neighbourhood; later they would have to move to Soacha and Antombo was transferred to a public school there. Her mother would pass away and their brother Omar would take care of them, though the Langangui sisters spent some time at an ICBF centre.\nAntombo is fluent in French, her mother tongue, Spanish and English.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhen she was in high school, Antombo joined a project named Las Panteras Negras. Around 2000, Antombo visited her sister Alba in Puerto Tejada, where she met Pablo Belalcázar, best known as Pablo Fortaleza. A year later they formed Profetas, an Afro-Colombian music duo fusing reggae, hip hop, and Afro-Colombian sounds. With Profetas, Antombo has toured in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and the United States.\nAntombo released her first solo album Natural in 2017.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== With Profetas ===\nAmor y fortaleza, 2006\nBaila, 2011\nTiempo, 2016\nAfrodisíaco, 2020\n\n\n=== As a solo artist ===\n\n\n==== Albums ====\nNatural, 2017\n\n\n==== Singles ====\nLa movie, 2022\nLa campeona, 2022\nTwerk, 2022\nBésame, 2023\nQué calor, 2023\nLocation, 2024\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInstagram profile\nTwitter profile",

During the process, the roles of Álvaro Rudolphy in the lead role and Vicente Sabatini as director of the production were confirmed.\nHowever, the pre-production of the project suffered setbacks to health measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile, which resulted in the temporary suspension of Sabatini's participation and the halting of negotiations with the actors.\nIn November 2020, pre-production, casting and script reading activities resumed, culminating in the confirmation of Daniela Ramírez in the female lead role, as well as the incorporation of actors such as Simón Pesutic, Francisco Reyes, Mariana Loyola and María José Illanes.\nIn September 2022, its sales process in the international market was announced.

        "content": "Denis Vladimirovich Gorin (Russian: Денис Владимирович Горин; born November 15, 1979) is a Russian serial killer and cannibal who, with the aid of his brother, committed at least four murders in the town of Aniva, Sakhalin Oblast, from 2002 to 2012. Despite the gravity of his crimes, Gorin was given a lenient sentence of 22 years imprisonment after he was convicted in 2018.\nIn early 2023, while in a penal colony, Gorin signed a contract with a PMC and was sent to Ukraine to participate in the Russian invasion of the country. Gorin fought in the ranks of the Storm-Z and was wounded during a battle, after which President Vladimir Putin pardoned him and allowed him to return to his hometown. This act sparked outrage across Russia, causing great debate about the morality of pardoning criminals to fight in the ongoing war.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nVery little is known about the early years of Denis Gorin's life. Born on November 15, 1979, in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, Khabarovsk Krai, but later on in life, his family moved to Aniva, in the Sakhalin Oblast. He has one brother named Evgeniy and a sister whose name is not known to the public.\nWhile living in the town, Gorin was regarded well by locals, as he not known to engage in any criminal activities or aggressive behaviors. After graduating from high school, he married and had two children, but the family began experiencing financial struggles later on due to Gorin's lack of high education. In the early 2000s, Gorin became an alcoholic and started living on the streets.\n\n\n== Murders ==\n\n\n=== First murder and imprisonment ===\nIn late 2002, the then-23-year-old Gorin committed his first known murder, with the victim being an acquaintance of his. He was arrested a short time afterwards, and was charged with murder and desecrating a corpse. At trial, Gorin stated that he after killing the victim, he cut off the soft tissues of his body and then ate them, claiming that he had done under the threats of his brother Evgeniy, an accomplice who threatened to kill him if he didn't cannibalize the victim. \nOn March 6, 2003, Gorin was sentenced to 9 years and 11 months imprisonment in a strict regime colony, which he served at an undisclosed location in the Irkutsk Oblast. After serving seven years, he was paroled on April 19, 2010, and returned to Aniva, where he continued to live on the streets for the next two years. During this period, he never worked and earned his money by doing odd jobs and stealing, spending most of his time among other homeless people and alcoholics.\n\n\n=== Serial murders ===\nIn June 2011, the Gorin brothers became enraged after learning that their nephew had been abused by an acquaintance, after which they went to the apartment to confront him. However, once they got inside, they instead beat up a young man who was not involved into unconsciousness - taking advantage of the fact that he was knocked out, Denis proceeded to slit his throat. After that, the two brothers carried the body to the bank of the Lyutoga River, where they buried it in a shallow grave. The victim's body was discovered in the spring of 2012.\nThe next murder the brothers committed took place during the celebration of the Old New Year, on the night of January 14-15, 2012. The two were at the \"Cheremushki\" store when they got into some sort of conflict with an acquaintance, whom Denis proceeded to stab at least 29 times with a knife - the man would later succumb from the injuries. That same day, Gorin was arrested by the police and immediately began confessing. On February 27, 2013, he was convicted of the two murders and sentenced to 20 years and 10 months imprisonment. His brother Evgeniy did not live to see the trial; in mid-2012, he died while incarcerated at a temporary detention center in Aniva under unclear circumstances.\n\n\n=== Confession to unsolved murder ===\nAfter the trial, Gorin was transferred to a penal colony. In June 2017, he contacted the Sakhalin Oblast Prosecutor's Office and confessed to an unsolved murder, after which he was transported back to Aniva to give testimony. According to him, this killing was committed on November 21, 2010, with the victim being another acquaintance named Alexander, with whose brother Denis had been incarcerated at a temporary detention center from February 25 to March 6, 2003. While drinking together, Gorin recalled an incident that seemed amusing to him - while he and Alexander's brother had been incarcerated at the detention center, a drunken Alexander attempted to deliver a parcel to his brother, but was detained for disorderly conduct because of his state of intoxication. Alexander seemed to be annoyed by this story, causing them to have an argument and separate.\nThat same evening, after attending his ex-wife's birthday party, an intoxicated Gorin decided to go to Alexander's house to resolve their argument from earlier. However, they instead continued arguing, whereupon Gorin grabbed a knife and stabbed Alexander twice in the chest. After killing him, he then cut pieces of his biceps, calves and thighs, which he proceeded to eat. Gorin then dragged the corpse to the Lyutoga River, where he undressed it, picked it up and dragged it into the water, leaving it at a considerable distance from the shore. Gorin then returned to his ex-wife birthday party, which was still ongoing. Despite leaving for approximately 35-40 minutes, apparently nobody had noticed Gorin's absence. When asked why he ate pieces of his victim's remains, Gorin simply said that he had developed a taste for human flesh after committing his first murder back in 2002.\nIn the following months, however, he recanted his testimony and claimed that the police had tortured him into confessing out of fear for further reprisals against him and pressure against his family members. However, the overwhelming amount of evidence proved that he had indeed committed the murder, and on June 27, 2018, Gorin was given 22 years imprisonment. He avoided receiving life imprisonment due to his initial confession and cooperation with law enforcement, and was even given time served by the district court. With this taken into account, he was scheduled for release in 2032.\n\n\n=== Possible additional victims ===\nGorin's true victim count has been the subject of much debate, with some of his neighbors claiming that he had confessed to them that he had killed at least 13 people. The testimony of one such neighbor, known only as \"Dmitry Vladimirovich\", stated that after being arrested in 2012, officers opened a refrigerator and found an abundance of human meat in there. \"Dmitry\" also said claimed that the two brothers had attempted to kill another local in a drunken stupor, and that Denis once took him to a pit where he said claimed to have buried the remains of 12 people - the pit supposedly had multiple skeletons, including that of what appeared to be a young girl. \nLocal authorities have never commented officially on these claims, and it is unclear if any investigations into further victims ever took place.\n\n\n== Pardon ==\nIn early 2023, Gorin, while still incarcerated in a penal colony, signed a contract with a PMC and was sent to fight in Ukraine as part of a Storm-Z penal battalion. In the summer or early fall of 2023, he received a moderate injury in combat, after which President Putin pardoned him. The pardon caused a public outcry across Russia, leading to the incident being covered nationally and even internationally. \nOn October 24, 2023, Gorin published a photo on his Odnoklassniki page dressed in a military uniform with a ribbon of Saint George and a patch with the inscription \"Zacheburashim\", similar to what volunteers wear on the Ukrainian front. Friends and acquaitances of Gorin stated that after being wounded in battle, he was sent for treatment at a military hospital in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Russian serial killers\nList of incidents of cannibalism\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRussia v.

        "content": "Antanas Olšauskas (June 13, 1863 – May 10, 1942) was a Lithuanian American businessman. He was the published of the Lithuanian weekly Lietuva and founder of A. Olszewski Bank.\nOrphaned at an early age, Olšauskas did not receive any formal education. He worked as a carpenter before emigrating to the United States at the age of 25. He managed to get a job at a Polish printing press. In 1893, he took over the struggling Lithuanian weekly newspaper Lietuva and turned it around. It became a popular liberal periodical. He then established A. Olszewski Bank which served the Lithuanian American community. It became successful and customer deposits peaked at $1 million. Olšauskas used customer deposits to build offices and open other business ventures (Theater Milda, clothing shop, car dealership, residential real estate). A bank run in 1916 forced him to sell these businesses and liquidate the bank. However, he was able to raise capital and establish the Universal State Bank in 1917. After quarrels with the new leadership of the Universal State Bank, Olšauskas resigned in 1919. He then made a modest living selling ship tickets and insurance.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nOlšauskas was born on June 13, 1863, in Aštruliai, a small village near Liudvinavas, to a family of petty Lithuanian nobles. He was orphaned at the age of four and his family's farm was sold off for debts. He was raised by his maternal grandparents who taught him basic literacy skills. Olšauskas never received any formal education. Due to poor health, he could not perform hard physical labor and searched for better means of living. He learned carpentry and worked to construct furniture, repair church altars, etc. For two years, he worked to restore the Catholic church in Krasnopol. In 1889, having saved 300 rubles, Olšauskas decided to emigrate to the United States.\n\n\n=== Publisher of Lietuva ===\nHe arrived to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in April 1889. He tried to pursue carpentry, but could not get a better job due to poor English language skills. Olšauskas was inspired by the example of two Lithuanian businessmen who published the Lithuanian newspaper Vienybė lietuvininkų and pursued jobs at emigrant publishing houses. Eventually, he was hired by the Polish Gazeta Polska published in Chicago. In 1892, Olšauskas worked as a typesetter for Polish newspaper Nowe Życie but it went bankrupt. He convinced the new owner, Stasys Rakošius, to publish the first Lithuanian newspaper in Chicago Lietuva. The first issue was published on December 6, 1892, but Rakošius sold the printing press to Vincas Žaliauskas who fired Olšauskas.\nThe printing press of Lietuva continued to struggle. Olšauskas and three other men agreed to take it over for US$300 (equivalent to $10,173 in 2023). Olšauskas was primarily in charge of content starting with the 24th issue. The newspaper became a liberal publication which advocated for unity among Lithuanian immigrants, campaigned for a Lithuanian representative in the U.S. Congress, promoted entrepreneurship and self-improvement, discussed relations between Poles and Lithuanians, debated political issues concerning Lithuania. The newspaper gained popularity and the printing press relocated to more spacious premises in 1894. Experienced journalist Juozas Adomaitis-Šernas became chief editor of Lietuva in December 1895.\nIn addition to publishing Lietuva, the printing house also published Lithuanian books. In 1894–1917, it published a total of 131 books, of which 45 were original and others were translations. These included 28 books on fairytales, legends, novellas, 31 theater plays, 20 popular science works, 15 texts on history, ethnography, culture, and three dictionaries.\n\n\n=== Banker ===\nOlšauskas became known as a reliable man. Thus, Lithuanians began bringing him sums of money for safekeeping. This inspired Olšauskas to establish a bank which primarily served as a bank of the Lithuanian American community. He built two-floor house on the 33rd Street for $5,000 (equivalent to $183,120 in 2023) in 1896. He lived on the second floor, while the first floor had the printing press, bookstore, and A. Olszewski Bank. The business was going well and Olšauskas was able to buy out other owners of Lietuva remaining the sole shareholder of the printing press in 1901. In 1905, socialists inspired printing press workers to go on strike. When Lietuva missed an issue, rumors spread that Olšauskas was going bankrupt, but his bank withstood a bank run and continued to grow. Customer deposits at A. Olszewski Bank peaked at $1 million. Lithuanians sent some $4 million to relatives at home via the bank in 1895–1914.\nIn 1906, Olšauskas decided to build three-floor house on the corner of 33rd and Halsted Street at a cost of $100,000 (equivalent to $3,391,111 in 2023). It housed not only the printing press and bank, but also a clothing store, medical offices, and rented apartments. He used customer deposits for other business ventures – opening a clothing and a furniture store, establishing a car dealership, building residential houses, etc. He built 1200-seat Milda Theater at a cost of $250,000. He also improved the printing press and wanted to publish the first Lithuanian-language encyclopedia.\nIn 1916, Olšauskas started raising the required $200,000 capital for the establishment of a state bank. However, another Lithuanian community bank (Tananevicz Savings Bank) failed which caused a bank run on Olšauskas' bank. It is estimated that at the time, the bank had about $600,000 in customer deposits and only $100,000 in cash. Olšauskas was forced to sell the various businesses (including Lietuva) and personal assets at prices that were deflated due to the ongoing World War I. Nevertheless, he managed to return the deposits to customers and establish the Universal State Bank in 1917. However, because he lacked any financial education, Olšauskas was allowed only a vice-president role. He quarreled with the new leadership under chairman Juozapas J. Elias and resigned from the bank in 1919.\nOlšauskas then opened a small office that sold ship tickets to new Lithuanian emigrants, sold insurance, provided notary services, etc. He did not regain his business fortune and died on May 10, 1942, in Chicago.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKasparavičius, Gediminas (2019). \"XIX a. pab. – XX a. pr. lietuviai verslininkai JAV\" [Lithuanian businessmen in the United States at the turn of the 20th century].

        "content": "Lucius Mestrius Florus was a Roman senator in the first century AD and is mentioned several times by the philosopher and writer Plutarch in his work, Moralia.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMestrius Florus was a Novus homo, meaning that he was the first of his family to serve in the Roman Senate. His entry into the Senate can be dated to the reign of Emperor Nero (reigned 54–68). In the Year of the Four Emperors, 69 AD, Florus stayed in Rome, and, with other Senators, accompanied Emperor Otho in the civil war against his opponent Vitellius. Plutarch emphasizes that Florus joined this military campaign unwillingly. Eventually, Otho's troops were defeated in the First Battle of Bedriacum. According to the imperial biographer Suetonius, Florus is said to have had a good relationship with Emperor Vespasian, being one of his closest confidants and a friend. It is believed that Florus served as suffect consul around the year 75 AD, however, the exact date is unknown.\nIn 88 AD, Mestrius Florus was appointed as Governor of the province of Asia. He held an office in Achaea, and met the writer Plutarch. He became his sponsor and gave him Roman Citizenship. Therefore, according to Roman customs, Plutarch adopted the gentile name Mestrius.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMestria gens\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joseph Maria Louis, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudémont (23 June 1759 – 29 March 1812) served as an Austrian general during the French Revolutionary Wars. Born into a noble family in France, he went into exile in 1791 during the French Revolution and offered his services to the Habsburg monarchy. He fought in the Austrian army during the War of the First Coalition, rising in rank from leading a cavalry regiment to commanding a brigade. He led a division during the War of the Second Coalition and the War of the Third Coalition. He died in Hungary in 1812.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nJoseph Maria Louis, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudémont was born on 23 June 1759 in Paris, in the Kingdom of France. His father was Louis, Prince of Brionne (1725–1761) and his mother was Louise Julie Constant of Rohan. His older brother was Charles Eugene, Prince of Lambesc (1751–1825) and his sisters were Princess Joséphine of Lorraine (1753–1797) and Princess Charlotte of Lorraine (1755–1786). He married Louise Auguste de Montmorency-Logny in 1778. When his father died, his 10-year-old older brother Charles became the head of the family. Sometime after he turned 26-years-old, Charles became the proprietor of the Royal Allemand Dragoon Regiment, a unit recruited from Germans loyal to the French crown. After the outbreak of the French Revolution, Charles, his younger brother Joseph, and the entire Royal Allemand Regiment went into exile. On 1 February 1793, the unit was accepted into Austrian service and in 1798 was named the Lorraine Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 10.  \n\n\n== War of the First Coalition ==\nOn 7 June 1791, vice president of the Hofkriegsrat Ferdinand Tige announced the appointment of the Prince of Vaudémont as Oberst (colonel) in the Austrian army. Vaudémont was assigned to the Austrian Netherlands under the command of Blasius Columban, Baron von Bender. In February 1792, he was appointed commander of the Coburg Dragoon Regiment Nr. 37. He fought at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792. At that battle, the regiment was split, with four squadrons assigned to the Center and four squadrons serving with the Reserve. On 8 March 1793, he was promoted to Generalmajor. In early 1795, Vaudémont commanded a heavy cavalry brigade in Gottlieb Friedrich von Schmertzing's division on the lower Rhine River. He transferred to the Army of the Upper Rhine under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser. \nWhen Wurmser was sent to northern Italy, the Prince of Vaudémont served under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour in the Army of the Upper Rhine as a commander of cuirassiers. During the Rhine campaign of 1796, he led his cavalry at the Battle of Ettlingen on 9 July, the Battle of Neresheim on 11 August, the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September, and the Battle of Schliengen on 24 October. He was promoted Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 1 March 1797 to rank from 20 February 1797. In September 1797, he commanded the Second Meeting of the Imperial and Royal Army camp at Villingen. \n\n\n== War of the Second Coalition ==\n\nIn March 1799, the Prince of Vaudémont served in the army of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen in Swabia. He commanded a brigade that consisted of the Kaiser Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 1 and the Duke Albert Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 3. He was successful leading his cavalry at the Battle of Stockach on 25 March 1799. He commanded an infantry division at the First Battle of Zurich on 4–7 June 1799. For his good leadership at Zurich, Archduke Charles wrote a letter of commendation to Emperor Francis. At Zurich, Vaudémont's division included two battalions each of the Kaiser Infantry Regiment Nr. 1 and Gemmingen Infantry Regiment Nr. 21, two squadrons of the Waldeck Dragoon Regiment Nr. 7, and one squadron of the Motschlitz Uhlan Regiment Nr. 1.     \nIn the 1800 campaign, Paul Kray commanded the army in Swabia. In the Battles of Stockach and Engen on 3 May 1800, Jean Victor Marie Moreau managed to concentrate 84,000 French troops against 72,000 Austrians. At Engen the main armies fought to a draw, but at Stockach the French massed 20,000 men under Claude Lecourbe against the Prince of Vaudémont's 12,000 Austrians. Lecourbe defeated him and drove the Austrians out of Stockach, capturing its supply base. This event convinced Kray to retreat. Two days later at the Battle of Messkirch the two armies clashed again. Kray posted Vaudémont on his left flank to hold the town of Messkirch supported by strong artillery batteries. A French division led by Joseph Montrichard made a frontal assault but was repulsed. Later, Montrichard's division returned to the attack from the south, together with a second division under Dominique Vandamme that struck from the southeast. Finally, Vaudémont abandoned Messkirch when he was outflanked. Kray withdrew his army to Sigmaringen that night.\n\n\n== Later career ==\nOn 7 October 1803, Emperor Francis appointed the Prince of Vaudémont the second inhaber of Kaiser Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 1. In 1805, he commanded a cavalry division in the Army of Italy under Archduke Charles. He fought at the Battle of Caldiero on 29–31 October 1805. His division was made up of the Levenehr Dragoon Regiment Nr. 4 and the Savoy Dragoon Regiment Nr. 5. Each regiment had eight squadrons. He was promoted General der Kavallerie on 22 January 1808. Vaudémont died at Szeged in the Kingdom of Hungary on 29 March 1812.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nArnold, James R. (2005). Marengo & Hohenlinden: Napoleon's Rise to Power.

        "content": "Gilbert C. Greenwalt (1889–1979) was an American politician and military officer.\nGreenwalt was born in Hastings, Iowa, and attended Simpson College. Following the American entry into World War I, Greenwalt was commissioned into the United States Army as a second lieutenant. Throughout his political career, Greenwalt was affiliated with the Republican Party. Between 1931 and 1931, Greenwalt served as Secretary of State of Iowa. During his first year in office, Greenwalt issued the first driver's licenses in Iowa. He ran for reelection in 1934, losing to Ola Babcock Miller. From 1937, Greenwalt began serving as treasurer of Polk County. The following year, Greenwalt noted that many driver's licenses purchased in December were Christmas gifts. He ran for reelection as in 1940, and served until 1941, when he was commissioned in the Iowa Army National Guard as a lieutenant colonel. J. F. Baillie was appointed by the county board of supervisors to replace Greenwalt. Following World War II, Greenwalt became commanding officer of Jefferson Barracks Military Post, and was succeeded by Malin Craig Jr. before Jefferson Barracks was decommissioned. By 1948, Greenwalt and his wife moved from West Des Moines, Iowa, to Fort Knox, Kentucky. Greenwalt retired from active service in 1955 and moved to Florida. He died in Bradenton on September 28, 1979, and, following services on October 1, was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Norris-Heartt House, also known as Norris House and Heartt House, is a historic Victorian house in Raleigh, North Carolina. The home was built in 1879 and was given as a wedding present for the socialite Cornelia Alice Norris. Following her death in 1935, it was purchased by Leo D. Heartt and converted into a boarding house. It was acquired by the state government in 1968 and housed the offices of the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the North Carolina State Office of Archaeology. It was vacated in 2007. The house underwent renovations from 2016 to 2018 and is now used as a private event venue.\n\n\n== History ==\nNorris-Heartt House was constructed on North Blount Street in 1879 by Alexander Boyd Andrews and was purchased by Jesse Allen Norris and Amy Ann Adams Norris as a wedding present for their daughter, Cornelia Alice Norris, and her husband, the merchant Matthew Tyson Norris. Her parents deeded the house exclusively in her name, not her husband's. The Norrises lived their entire married lives in the home and raised their five children in it. Cornelia Norris was a prominent Raleigh socialite who founded the Caswell-Nash Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the local press wrote about her entertaining in the home. \nMatthew Norris died in 1915. Following Cornelia's death in 1935, the house was sold to Leo D. Heartt. The Heartt family enlarged the house, converted it into a boarding house, and removed the original Italianate designs on the front, as well as interior decorative trim and some of the fireplaces, and replaced them with colonial features. \nIn 1968, the state government acquired the house from Heartt's widow and converted it into an office building housing the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the North Carolina State Office of Archaeology. The state archaeology office used the house as a curation space for artifacts and site files as well as an office space. The state's artifacts were relocated to a new research center in 1997 and the state office moved into the North Carolina Archives and History Building in 2007.\nAfter being vacant and falling into disrepair under government ownership, the house was sold and began being renovated in 2016, finishing in 2018. The 1930s addition of a two-story Colonial Revival front porch was removed and replaced with the original style Italianate Victorian front elevation. The Italianate elevation was made following historical records and the original masonry foundation, unearthed on site in April 2017. The house interior includes original doors, trim, stained glass windows, and a fireplace with mantel. The house is now used as a venue for private events.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Styphelia lanata is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to Western Australia. It is a shrub with wand-like branches, usually covered with loose, soft hairs, the leaves linear to lance-shaped about 12 mm (0.47 in) long, and white, tube-shaped flowers with small bracts and bracteoles. The lobes of the petal tube are bearded only at the base.\nThis species was first formally described in 1859 by Sergei Sergeyevich Sheglejev who gave it the name Coleanthera virgata in the Bulletin de la Société impériale des naturalistes de Moscou. In 2020, Michael Hislop, Darren Crayn and Caroline Puente-Lelievre transferred it to the genus Styphelia, but the name S. virgata was unavailable, as it was given to a species now known as Leucopogon virgatus (Labill.) R.Br. The name S. lanata was given to the new species.\nThis species of Styphelia is presumed extinct by the Government of Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In Haiti, the disruption of the water cycle remains a major environmental challenge, affecting biodiversity and the daily lives of the country's inhabitants. The problem has multiple causes, including the proliferation of shantytowns and the absence of a comprehensive urban development policy. Global warming is one of the main causes of this problem, faced with one of the most disastrous economic, social and political situations on the planet, Haiti is unable to implement an urban development policy. On the other hand, deforestation encourages natural disasters. Thus, the disruption of the water cycle remains a lasting threat to the country's development. \n\n\n== Hydrological context in Haiti ==\nLocated in the Caribbean, Haiti is exposed to a considerable ecological imbalance, characterized by catastrophic floods associated with torrential rains and hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, extreme climatic and meteorological variations that disrupt the water cycle. These problems are exacerbated by deforestation, soil degradation and unsustainable agricultural practices. Climate change, pollution and deforestation are the main causes of water cycle disruption in cities and slums. These causes include an increase in ocean water temperature, and a considerable reduction in the quantity of water available at groundwater level.\n\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nClimate change is often described as one of the most pressing environmental challenges we face worldwide. Long-term changes in temperature and precipitation are often accompanied by heat waves and intense rainfall, increasing the risk of flooding, especially in Caribbean countries such as Haiti.\nFloods, droughts and the degradation of aquatic ecosystems are examples of the effects of disruption of the water cycle. Shortages of drinking water also aggravate public health problems.\nFloods, torrential rains, droughts, changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation and water scarcity are just some of the consequences of these disturbances. Important steps can be taken to reduce these disturbances, such as water conservation, protecting aquatic ecosystems, reducing pollution and promoting sustainable management of water resources, reforestation to preserve watersheds, improving agricultural techniques to reduce erosion, and adopting more efficient technologies for water management.\nClimatic disturbances are also the cause of numerous infectious diseases, including vector-borne diseases transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods such as dengue fever, Zika, chikungunya and malaria.\nClimate change is often described as one of the most pressing environmental challenges challenges we face worldwide.\nLong-term changes in temperature and precipitation are often accompanied by heat waves heat waves and intense rainfall, increasing the risk of flooding, particularly in countries Caribbean countries such as Haiti.\n\n\n===== Consequences =====\nDisruption of the water cycle has a greater impact on physical ecosystems than temperature variations. ecosystems, which are sensitive to changes in hydro-climatic conditions. Precipitation intensity and physico-chemical water conditions at Lake Azuei in Haiti Azuei in Haiti can vary according to the natural abundance, composition and concentrations of concentrations of mineralogical elements in the sediments.\nHuman activities such as agricultural practices and changes in land cover caused by deforestation caused by deforestation have modified the land around Lake Azuei.\nFloods, droughts and the degradation of aquatic ecosystems are examples of the effects disruption of the water cycle.

        "content": "The Battle of Vërrin (Albanian: Beteja e Vërrinit; Serbian: битка код Верина, romanized: Bitka kod Verina) was fought during the Kosovo War between the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and the Yugoslav Police (Milicija). The first battle of Vërrin was fought on July 16 1998. During the period from September 1 to 5, 1998, Yugoslav Milicija units conducted an operation against the KLA. As part of this action, KLA positions located near Prizren, in the villages of Lez, Ješkovo, Kuštendil, Ljubičevo, and Hoča Zagradska were attacked. However, the primary engagement occurred in the village of Lez. The area where these villages are situated is referred to as Vërrin by Albanians, hence the designation \"Battle of Vërrin.\" This was the first battle in the Prizren District during the Kosovo War.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn July 7,  1998, Yugoslav forces failed to liquidate a KLA unit in Billushe and were forced to retreat. The Yugoslav army and police pledged retaliation for the ambush, strategizing an offensive against KLA positions in what had been declared a KLA free zone.\n\n\n== Frist Battle ==\nAround 1:30 PM, the Yugoslav forces tried to enter from the Tusus neighborhood, in the direction of Leskovec, Lybeçeva, and towards the village of Hoçë e Qytetit. KLA forces started attacking the Yugoslav forces. The first day of confrontation between the two forces lasted 3 hours and 40 minutes. On the part of the KLA soldiers, there were neither killed nor injured, while the Yugoslav forces were separated with losses.\n\n\n== Second Battle ==\nOn Monday, August 31, Yugoslav Police surrounded Lez. By Tuesday morning, September 1, 1998, around 8:00 a.m, they commenced shelling KLA positions in the hills surrounding the village. The villagers fled to nearby Ljubičevo, while the KLA members remained. The night before the second offensive, the KLA had information about large movements of Yugoslav troops around the territories where the KLA positions were located. The KLA soldiers were all in a state of readiness in their positions, with the command of the 125th brigade being put into action.\nThe 1st Battalion observed Yugoslav movements towards the top of Cyileni, commanders Salajdin Berisha and Xhevat Berisha with a part of the soldiers went to Cyilen. On September 1, 1998, at around 7 am, Yugoslav forces began the offensive against KLA positions. Initially, the attack began in the village of Lez, where fierce fighting took place and Yugoslav forces were met with heavy resistance. At a postion called Livadhet te Lavdices, a grenade exploded in the trench at this position, resulting in the deaths of four KLA members. Additionally, six KLA members were killed in the same position during the exchange of fire with the police. 3 more KLA soldiers were killed. Those killed were identified as KLA soldiers Xhevat Berisha, Salajdin Berisha, Shefqet Berisha, Hasim Berisha, Nehat Berisha, Alajdin Berisha, Bekim Berisha, Shahadin Berisha, Naip Berisha, Samidin Emini, Ibrahim Osmani, Asllan Berisha, and Izair Berisha.\nThe fighting soon spread throughout the territory of Vërrin. The Yugoslav forces shelled the positions of the 2nd Battalion from a distance, while the Yugoslav infantry tried to enter the positions of the 1st Battalion. Around 5 pm, Yugoslav forces broke through a KLA position and captured Lez. In Lez, three policemen were wounded: Miroslav Rakonjac was wounded by automatic weapons around 2:00 p.m., while Miroljub Ristić was seriously wounded, and Nenad Aleksić was lightly wounded by soldiers using automatic weapons, hand-held launchers, and mortars around 4:20 p.m.\nDuring the same night, while KLA soldiers were observing the terrain between the villages of Kushnin and Arbëri, the soldiers Tamil Shala, Refki Shala and Milaim Thaçi were ambushed. Yugoslav forces began penetrating towards the territory which was under KLA control. Kushnin, Arbëria, Lez, the headquarters of the 125th Brigade in Jeshkovo and the village itself, Hoça e Qytetit, Kushtrimi, Billushë, Poslisht as well as the KLA positions in Vërrin were shelled constantly by the Yugoslav forces. The shelling led to civilian casualties.\nThe fighting continued on September 2, fierce fighting was concentrated in the village of Jeshkovo because of the Yugoslav goal of penetrating the headquarters of the 125th Brigade, which was located in Jeshkovo. During the afternoon of September 2, Agim Shala, Avdi Shala, Besim Shala, and Fatmir Berisha died.\nHeavy shelling continued at Kushtrim and Billushë, and Yugoslav forces tried to enter Dushkaja of Poslisht, then the positions of Tusus. After some positions of the 1st Battalion were broken, the position at Tusus was in danger and the command of the 1st Battalion retreats to the village of Arbëri, while the 2nd Battalion remained at their positions. Astret Poniku, and Arsim Poniku were killed. KLA forces held their positions against the Yugoslav forces, and Jeshkova was under KLA control.\n\n\n== References ==",

The site of the city is today known as Amheida (Arabic: أمحيدة) and is located in the New Valley Governorate of Egypt. The Greek name of the city, Trimithis, comes from the Coptic Trimhite, meaning \"northern storehouse\". The modern Arabic name, also spelled Amhâdeh or Amhida, is probably derived from either the Greek or Coptic.\nArchaeological remains from the Old Kingdom have been found at Amheida. There was a template the site during the New Kingdom and a stela of Seti II has also been found. Habitation at the site increased exponentially under the Roman rule. Trimithis became a recognized polis (city). It declined rapidly in late antiquity. The Roman city was built around a temple of Thoth. Including its cemetery, it covered an area of at least 2.5 by 1.5 kilometres (1.55 mi × 0.93 mi).\nBernardino Drovetti described the site in 1821. John Gardner Wilkinson, who saw it in 1825, was the first to record its modern name, as Lémhada, in 1843. Archaeological investigation of the site began under Ahmed Fakhry in 1963.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBagnall, Roger S.; Kaper, Olaf E. (2016). \"Introduction\". An Oasis City.

She was previously Semarang's vice mayor under Hendrar Prihadi since 2016 until Hendrar's resignation in October 2022.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHevearita Gunaryanti Rahayu was born in Semarang on 4 May 1966. She studied at schools in Semarang, graduating from State High School No. 1 Semarang in 1984. She received a bachelor's degree in agriculture at the National Veteran Development University of Yogyakarta in 1989, and later received a master's degree from Diponegoro University in 2019.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1991, Hevearita began to work at Bank Universal, remaining there until 2003 after the bank merged into Permata Bank. She then became the director at an outsourcing company before becoming president director of an oil and gas company owned by the Central Java provincial government which operated in Cepu. She worked there until 2015.\nHevearita ran as the running mate to incumbent Hendrar Prihadi in the 2015 mayoral election for Semarang, and the pair was elected with 320,237 votes (46.4%). They were sworn in on 17 February 2016. Hendrar and Hevearita ran uncontested for a second term in the 2020 mayoral election and won 91.4% of votes against a blank ballot, being sworn in for their second term on 27 February 2021.\nOn 10 October 2022, Hendrar was appointed by president Joko Widodo as head of the national Procurement Policy Institute, and thus resigned from his post as mayor with Hevearita taking his place initially as acting mayor. She was sworn in as a full mayor on 30 January 2023, becoming the first female mayor of Semarang. As mayor, she allocated funds to purchase 177 motorcycles for administrative village heads across the city, replacing the last purchase in 2014. A brief social media controversy emerged due to misreporting of the purchase cost, nearly doubling the reported cost from Rp 4.7 billion (US$300,000) to Rp 8 billion (US$510,000).\nShe ruled out running for a second term in the 2024 election, stating that she intended to focus on her family.\n\n\n== Family ==\nShe is married to Alwin Basri, a member of the Central Java Regional House of Representatives. Their only son was born in 1995.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Annie Meyers (7 July 1873 – 25 January 1942) was the owner of the first guest house called 'Stuarts Guest Home', sometimes referred to as 'Mrs Meyers Guest House', in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMeyers was born in Cornwall and immigrated with her family the Moonta, South Australia when she was three years old. In Moonta her family worked as copper miners.\n\n\n== Life in the Northern Territory ==\nMeyers moved to Alice Springs, then known as Stuart, in the late 1890s and began working at the Stuart Arms Hotel which was then being leased by Thomas and Maryanne Gunther. Little is known of her early life but her sister, Elizabeth (Bessie) Williams also lived in Stuart and later married Ernest Allchurch, who was then employed at a telegraphist at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station where he would later become the postmaster.\nOn 23 May 1897 Meyers married saddler Aaron Schunke (Charlie) Meyers at the hotel, where she was still working, and the wedding was officiated by the Lutheran Pastor John Bogner from Hermannsburg. Following their marriage the purchased a block of land on Todd Street, what is now the Todd Mall, and established a saddlery. This saddlery, known as \"Charlie Meyer's Saddlery\" was at the Southern end of the street and was a simple structure with whitewashed stone walls, a thatched roof  and a verandah constructed of wooden packing cases. Meyers and Charlie lived a short distance away, on the Todd River and, by 1908, had three living children: Dorothy, Herman John (Jack) and Gwendoline (Gwen); they had lost an infant daughter Henrietta some years before. Meyers and her sister supported each other through their pregnancies and deliveries. \nMeyers marriage was not a happy one and in 1909 she decided to leave Alice Springs and take her children 'south', likely to Adelaide, for schooling. She did not return until 1924 when her sister also came back. When Meyers returned she and her husband Charlie were still estranged and he was spending much of his time working at Haasts Bluff where he ran cattle cattle and coming back to Alice Springs regularly for his saddlery and home-brew businesses. Meyers returned to their home on the river and, over the next two years, turned it into 'Stuarts Guest Home', the first boarding house in the town, which opened in 1926.\nThe guest home included a large vegetable garden, with many fruit trees and a large poultry run and, with these in place, she soon gained a reputation for serving the \"best food in town\". She applied for a liquor license in 1929 but was declined; she was, however, granted a publicans license in 1930 and the foundations for a new building were prepared but did not eventuate. Meyers blamed this on the Great Depression and the failure of The Granites gold mine.\nMeyers gave up the guest home in the late 1930s and then moved to Adelaide and, later, to Boulder (Western Australia) where she lived with her daughter Gwen. She died there on 25 January 1942.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nOlive Pink was a regular visitor at the 'Stuarts Guest Home' when she was working as an anthropologist at Thompsons Rockhole, which necessitated frequent visits to Alice Springs, and it was she who asked that, what was gazetted \"Meyers Hill\", be named \"Annie Meyers Hill\", part of Olive Pink Botanic Garden, after her. The Arrernte language name for this site is Tharrarletneme and it is a sacred site for Arrernte people.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Grand Hotel Villa Serbelloni is a historic luxury hotel located in Bellagio on the shores of Lake Como in Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe hotel was first built as a private villa, commissioned by the Frizzoni family, a noble family originally from the Grisons but established in Bergamo for generations. Construction of the villa, designed by architect Rodolfo Vantini, began in 1851 and was finally completed in 1856, the year of the architect's death. However, the villa was already partially ready in 1854 when it was inaugurated on the occasion of the count Frizzoni's wife's birthday.\nIn 1872, the villa was acquired by an Italian joint-stock company, the Société des Grands Hôtels, with the intention of transforming the property into a luxury hotel. The new owners entrusted the transformation project to architect Giovanni Ceruti, assisted by architect Ercole Balossi Merlo. Both were former students of Camillo Boito at the Polytechnic University of Milan. The work involved the construction of a long building behind the villa, connected by a covered passage, which extended to form two large side wings overlooking the lake.\nThe hotel thus opened its doors as the Grand Hotel Bellagio in 1873. \nIn 1918, the property was bought by the Swiss Arturo Bucher, who undertook modernization works. The Bucher family still owns the hotel today.\nAlong with the hotel, Arturo Bucher also managed Villa Serbelloni, which was already used as a luxury annex of the Grand Hotel since it was bought in 1905, and after which it was later named. Following the 1929 crisis, the villa was sold, but Bucher nonetheless retained the contractual right to use its name.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe building, located on the lakeshore in Bellagio, features elaborate decorations.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Grand Hotel Villa Serbelloni at Wikimedia Commons",

        "content": "Knightiellastrum is a single-species fungal genus in the family Icmadophilaceae. This monotypic genus the contains the corticolous (bark-dwelling), squamulose lichen species Knightiellastrum eucalypti, found in Tasmania, Australia.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThis lichen was originally described by Gintaras Kantvilas in 2011. It was first identified from specimens collected in Tasmania, Australia, where it was found on the moist trunks of old Eucalyptus obliqua trees in mixed forests. The type specimen was collected by Kantvilas along Hartz Road near the entrance to the Hartz Mountains National Park, and is stored at the Tasmanian Herbarium with duplicates at the British Museum.\nKantvilas provisionally classified the species in Icmadophila. This genus is characterised by a crustose to squamulose thallus that contains thamnolic acid and hosts a Coccomyxa-type photobiont. The genus is typically recognized for its sessile to stipitate fruiting bodies and Icmadophila-type asci. The original classification of Icmadophila eucalypti within this genus was based on its morphological, anatomical, ecological, and chemical features, although, as explained by Kantvilas, this placement was provisional due to unsuccessful attempts to confirm its taxonomy through DNA analysis. Further uncertainty regarding the generic placement was added by the absence of apothecia.\nSubsequent molecular phylogenetics analysis suggested that this Tasmanian endemic species does not align closely with Icmadophila. Instead, it shares closer ties with the genera Thamnolia and Knightiella, and is distantly related to Icmadophila. As a result, the species was reclassified in 2018 by Kantvilas as Knightiella eucalypti. This reassignment was supported by similar morphological traits and ecological niches between Knightiella eucalypti and other species within Knightiella, alongside their shared geographical distribution.\nFurther phylogenetic analyses using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and nuclear large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (nuLSU) gene sequences clarified the taxonomic position of Icmadophila eucalypti, leading to its reclassification into the new genus Knightiellastrum. These studies revealed that Icmadophila, as previously understood, was not a monophyletic group. Icmadophila eucalypti, now referred to as Knightiellastrum eucalypti, and Icmadophila splachnirima (renamed to Knightiella splachnirima) are distantly related to each other and also to the core Icmadophila species, which include I. ericetorum, I. aversa, and I. japonica. The separation was strongly supported by Bayesian inference, showing Knightiellastrum eucalypti as sister to a large clade containing traditional Icmadophila species and other related genera. This restructuring reflects significant phylogenetic distinctions warranting a new genus, confirming earlier provisional assignments based solely on non-molecular characteristics.\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe species name, eucalypti, reflects the lichen's common association with eucalyptus trees. The genus name Knightiellastrum combines Knightiella with the Latin suffix -astrum, suggesting a partial resemblance. This designation reflects that the thallus morphology of the type species vaguely echoes that of a smaller, infertile Knightiella splachnirima.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe thallus of Knightiellastrum eucalypti is squamulose, showing colours ranging from whitish to pale grey, and occasionally with hints of pale bluish, creamish, or beige. It forms expansive, irregular colonies that can reach up to 50 cm (20 in) in width. The individual squamules vary in size from 1 to 5 mm across, and have an uneven thickness between 130 and 350 μm. These squamules are densely packed with crystals that shine under polarised light and dissolve in a solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH).\nThe squamules emerge from a diffuse, very thin, and ephemeral primary thallus that appears white. They are scattered and discrete or overlapping, rarely merging into each other. The shapes of the squamules are notably diverse, ranging from stellate and rosette-like forms to flabellate arrangements. Typically, one side of the squamule adheres closely to the substrate while the other side ascends. The edges are initially finely toothed and somewhat thickened, but they soon develop nodules, small lobes, or palmate lobes and become slightly shrubby (subfruticulose) in appearance. The upper surface of the squamules is matt, smooth, or minutely rough, featuring a pseudocortex made up of randomly oriented, short hyphae measuring 3–5 μm wide, interspersed with occasional dead algal cells.\nThe lower surface is white and lacks a cortical layer (ecorticate). Soredia, which are coarse granular structures about 40–80 μm in diameter and the same colour as the thallus, emerge along the margins of the squamules. These soredia begin to erode the margins and spread across the upper surface.\nThe photobiont of Knightiellastrum eucalypti is a unicellular green alga, which forms spherical cells between 5 and 11 μm in diameter. The lichen does not have ascomata or pycnidia, suggesting a primary method of reproduction and dispersal through soredia. The secondary chemistry is characterised by the presence of thamnolic acid. Chemical tests on the thallus show a vivid yellow reaction with potassium hydroxide (K+), orange with paraphenylenediamine (P+), and no reaction with calcium hypochlorite (C–) or ultraviolet light (UV–).\n\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\nKnightiellastrum eucalypti is found across Tasmania, thriving in both wet eucalypt rainforests and cool temperate rainforests. This species is adaptable, ranging from lowland to subalpine elevations. It predominantly inhabits the lower, shaded sections of the trunks of very large trees, particularly those with thick, fibrous bark. The lichen most commonly grows on Eucalyptus obliqua, a species prevalent in many of Tasmania's wet eucalypt forest ecosystems. Occasionally, it is also found on the fire-sensitive rainforest conifer Athrotaxis selaginoides.\nKnightiellastrum eucalypti typically forms extensive colonies on the moister sides of these trees, often in the company of other lichens that share a similar squamulose growth form, such as Cladonia rigida, Neophyllis melacarpa, and Cladia schizopora. Its preference for very old trees indicates its potential utility as an indicator of ancient forest presence, which could be valuable in ecological and conservation studies.\n\n\n== References ==",

The main altarpiece has a depiction of the Madonna and Child, revered as the Madonna dei Gabellieri by Giuseppe Arrighi. Also in the altar is a depiction of St Francis of Paola by Ippolito Cigna.\nFrom the facade, you can look down at the Fonti di San Felice, a spring fed fountain within the city walls. A church dedicated to St Felix was once located nearby.\n\n\n== Sources ==",

        "content": "Alfredo Arróniz Vidal (15 September 1902 – 15 May 1976) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder for Valencia CF and CD Castellón.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAlfredo Arróniz was born on 15 September 1902 in Murcia, but lived most of his life in Valencia, where he began his sporting career at Gimnástico FC in 1923, featuring alongside the likes of Silvino and Enrique Molina. Initially, he played as a forward, becoming one of the best scorers in the region. His good performance eventually drew the attention of Valencia CF, who signed him in the summer of 1925, making his debut on 19 July against Natación de Alicante. In his first season at the club, he played 32 games, scored 3 goals and won a regional champion, which he won again in his second and last campaign with the club. While at Valencia, he showed himself as a player of determination and courage, sometimes more concerned with the fight with the opponent than with finishing the plays. The presence of Arturo Montesinos moved him to the right wing, where he had to play as a winger without being able to show off his best qualities. On 1 May 1926, he played a friendly match against Real Madrid, scoring once to help his side to an epic 4–3 victory.\nIn 1927, Arróniz returned to Gimnástico, and on his first visit to Mestalla Stadium on 8 December 1927, he provided a spectacular assist to Silvino for his side's second goal in an eventual 2–4 loss, but at the end of the match he was sent off along with Francisco Reyes because he \"had harassed Lluch in a bad way, who had fallen to the ground; the referee finally put the matter to rest by inviting them to end the discussion off the field\". Then he went to Castellón de la Plana, where he settled permanently and married in December 1929, becoming one of the most important players of the club, winning two Regional Championships in 1929 and 1930. He returned to Mestalla on several occasions, always starring in great and controversial performances. He ended his career at Sport Club de La Plana in 1935.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nValencia CF\nValencia Championship:\n\nWinners (2) 1926 and 1927\nCD Castellón\nValencia Championship:\n\nWinners (2) 1929 and 1930\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Joe Goode (1951) is an American choreographer, director, performer, and writer known for creating multidimensional performance works, often about identity and interpersonal relationships in contemporary times.\nGoode founded Joe Goode Performance Works in 1986. Goode is \"widely known as an innovator in the field of dance for his willingness to collide movement with spoken word, song, and visual imagery.\"\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJoe Goode was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1951. He graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1973.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter college, Goode moved to New York to join the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. In 1973 he relocated to San Francisco and joined the Margaret Jenkins Dance Company.\nIn 1983 he premiered his first independent choreographic work Stanley in San Francisco.\nA 1999 review of Gender Heros describes Goode's process, \"Joe Goode based “Gender Heroes Part I” on interviews conducted with Bay Area community members from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, ranging from elderly persons and first-generation Americans to transgendered individuals and cross-dressers. This world premiere explores the social and cultural forces that influence gender, and the expectations of men and women in our communities. Through dance and spoken word, the piece uses the collected narratives to offer a glimpse into the personal journey toward one's gender identity.\"\nSF Chronicle Arts and Culture Critic, Steven Winn, calls Goode's 2008 Wonderboy an, \"achingly tender new dance theater piece . . . in one of those passages of innocent joy that Goode can conjure like no one else.\" He claims, \"Goode's work often skates on, and over, the line of preciousness. . .\"\nGoode became a tenured professor of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies at UC Berkeley upon joining the faculty in 2001.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nNew York Dance and Performance (“Bessie”) Award, 1998\nSan Francisco Isadora Duncan (“Izzie”) Award, 1998\nIrvine Fellowship in Dance, 1998\nCreative Capital, 2000\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Fellowship for choreography, 2007\nUSA Fellow, 2008\nNational Endowment for the Arts\nCalifornia Arts Council\n\n\n== Creative work ==\nStanley, 1983\n29 Effeminate Gestures, 1987\nThe Disaster Series, 1989\nMaverick Strain, 1996\nDeeply There (Stories of a Neighborhood), 1998\nGender Heroes, 1999\nBody Familiar, 2003\nGrace, 2004\nTransformations, 2006\nHumansville, 2007\nWonderboy, 2008\nTraveling Light, 2009\nThe Resilience Project\nAs We Go, 2023\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRamsay Burt.

        "revision_id": 1223629973,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Israeli support for Hamas refers to direct involvement by Israeli authorities from different periods in the rise and empowerment of Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nAssertions of Israeli support for Hamas date back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, a period marked by significant political upheaval in the Middle East. Former Israeli officials have openly acknowledged Israel's role in providing funding and assistance to Hamas as a means of undermining secular Palestinian factions such as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Brigadier General Yitzhak Segev, who served as the Israeli military governor in Gaza during the early 1980s, admitted to providing financial assistance to Muslim Brotherhood, the precursor of Hamas, on the instruction of the Israeli authorities. The aim of the support was to weaken leftist and secular Palestinian organizations.\nIsrael contributed to the construction of parts of Islamist politician Ahmed Yassin's network of mosques, clubs, and schools in Gaza, as well as the expansion of these institutions.\n\n\n=== Policy ===\nUpon a visit to Israel from Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and Turkish lawmaker Feyzi İşbaşaran in 1998, it was revealed that Netanyahu suggested Turkey to support Hamas. Netanyahu said \"Hamas also has bank accounts for aid in banks, we help them too, you [Turkey] can help too.\"\n\n\n=== Israeli backing of Qatar sending millions of dollars to Gaza ===\nQatar started sending money to the Gaza Strip on a monthly basis in 2018. $15 million worth of cash-filled suitcases were transported into Gaza by the Qataris via Israeli territory. The payments commenced due to the 2017 decision by the Palestinian Authority (PA), an administration in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and rival to Hamas, to cut government employee salaries in Gaza. At the time, the PA objected to the funds, which Hamas said was intended for both medical and governmental salary payments. In August 2018, Israel's government approved the agreement.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended allowing transfer of millions of dollars to Hamas-run Gaza despite criticism from within his own government, including the education minister Naftali Bennet. After the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, Netanyahu went on record denying the claims that he facilitated financing of Hamas in order to create a 'divide and conquer' situation. He also said that he transferred funds to avoid \"humanitarian collapse\" in Gaza. Israeli intelligence officials believe that the money had a role in the success of 2023 Hamas-led attack.\n\n\n=== Work permits granted by Israel ===\nTalks regarding expanding the amount of work permits Israel issued to Gazan laborers also included officials from Hamas. This kept money flowing into Gaza.\n\n\n== Viewpoints and rebuttal ==\nIn an interview with Politico in 2023, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that \"In the last 15 years, Israel did everything to downgrade the Palestinian Authority and to boost Hamas.\" He continued saying \"Gaza was on the brink of collapse because they had no resources, they had no money, and the PA refused to give Hamas any money. Bibi saved them. Bibi made a deal with Qatar and they started to move millions and millions of dollars to Gaza.\" At a party conference of Likud in 2019, Benyamin Netanyahu said: \"Anyone who wants to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to support strengthening Hamas.\"\nPrime minister Netanyahu responded to the accusations of funding and strengthening Hamas by calling it \"ridiculous\".\n\n\n=== Tool to disengage from peace talks ===\nShlomo Brom, retired general and former deputy to Israel's national security adviser, believes that an empowered Hamas helps Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu avoid negotiatings over a Palestinian state, suggesting that there is no viable partner for peace talks. Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right lawmaker and finance minister under Netanyahu Government, called the Palestinian Authority a \"burden\" and Hamas an \"asset\".\nProfessor Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official, publicly acknowledged that Hamas was \"Israel's creation.\" Similar statesments have been made by Yasser Arafat.\n\n\n== See also ==\nForeign relations of Hamas\nOperation Cyclone, US aid to Afghan mujahideen.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Nanbaree (c.1782 – 12 August 1821), also named Nanbarry and Andrew Snape Hamond Douglass White, was an Aboriginal Australian of the Gadigal clan who undertook a prominent role in establishing communication between the Aboriginal people and the colonists during the early stages of British occupation of the Sydney area. While still a child, he was the first Aboriginal Australian to acquire a functional level of English and became an important interpreter as he had very close kinship ties with prominent figures such as Bennelong and Colebe. During adulthood, he became a notable sailor, voyaging with Matthew Flinders.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNanbaree was born around 1782 into the Gadigal clan of the Dharug people who spoke the Eora language in what is now the Sydney region.\n\n\n=== Arrival of the British and smallpox ===\nIn 1788, Nanbaree witnessed the arrival of Arthur Phillip in Sydney Harbour with the First Fleet to establish a penal colony consisting of British military personnel and transported convicts.\nIn April 1789, a major smallpox epidemic broke out amongst the Dharug people living around the harbour, killing approximately half of the population. Phillip with the colony's surgeon, John White and a captured Dharug man named Arabanoo, went to look for survivors. They found a boy around 7 years of age and his father lying sick on a beach covered in smallpox lesions. Nearby were the dead bodies of the boy's mother and baby sister. The boy and his father were taken back to the British settlement where they were cared for by White and Arabanoo in a hut next to the field hospital. The boy's name was Nanbaree. His father soon died, as did Arabanoo, but Nanbaree recovered and was taken to live with White and his servant.\n\n\n== Living with the British ==\nWhite helped teach Nanbaree English and gave Nanbaree the British name of Andrew Snape Hamond Douglass White, after Sir Andrew Hamond, who he had served under previous to being assigned to the First Fleet. Soon after Nanbaree's arrival at the British settlement, another young smallpox survivor, a twelve-year-old girl named Boorong, was brought in. She was taken into the household of the colony's chaplain Richard Johnson and developed a close friendship with Nanbaree. A couple of months later they were further joined by Nanbaree's uncle Colebe and by Bennelong, who were both forcibly abducted by the British, but they managed to escape after several months. Nanbaree also tried to escape when he was taken by boat to be shown to his surviving relatives, but was restrained from swimming to them.\n\n\n=== Interpreter for the colonists ===\nBy 1790, Nanbaree had become accustomed to living with the British and became quite good at speaking English. He was utilised as an interpreter by the colonists to communicate with his kinspeople. Despite his young age, he acted as an important interlocutor when a group of officers encountered Bennelong and Colebe at Manly, a situation that later developed into the incident where Phillip was speared and wounded by the warrior Willemering. Despite this violence, further interactions between Bennelong and the British, translated by Nanbaree and Boorong, saw a thawing of relations resulting in more Aboriginal people visiting the British settlement.\nNanbaree's language skills and position within the colony also became useful in warning his people about military operations that were planned against them. On one occasion he informed Ballooderry that soldiers were coming to shoot him and on another he told Colebe that a punitive expedition had been ordered by the governor against the warrior Pemulwuy.\n\n\n=== White's household ===\nNanbaree continued to live with White, whose household was expanding. White took on a convict mistress named Rachel Turner, who had arrived with the Second Fleet in 1790. The couple had a baby in 1793. White was also assigned a convict artist named Thomas Watling, who became friends with Nanbaree and drew portraits of him and other Dharug people; the portraits later became part of the Watling Collection. In 1794, White returned to England, leaving Nanbaree in Sydney without a patron.\n\n\n== Adulthood ==\n\nWith White gone, Nanbaree became somewhat more aligned with his Aboriginal relatives. In January 1795, he underwent an initiation ceremony called yoolang erah-badiang with several other boys at Farm Cove. The British were allowed to observe and document the event, in which Nanbaree and the other initiates had one of their upper incisor teeth ritually evulsed. In a break from tradition, Nanbaree's extracted tooth was given to the Judge Advocate, David Collins.\nAs the British colony expanded throughout the greater Sydney area, Aboriginal life became increasingly fractured. Factional feuds between Nanbaree's kin and the remnants of other clans escalated in 1797 when Nanbaree's uncle, Colebe, killed a young rival named Yeranibee and his wife. This set off a series of reprisals aimed at Colebe and his relatives. Nanbaree and Colebe were able to utilise their favourable connections with the British, and were protected by soldiers when their lives were at risk from being speared.\n\n\n=== Sailor ===\nNanbaree's links with the British also facilitated his employment as a sailor on HMS Reliance under the command of Captain Henry Waterhouse. In 1799, he sailed with another Aboriginal mariner named Bondel on Reliance to Norfolk Island. In 1802, Nanbaree was assigned to the crew of HMS Investigator under the command of Captain Matthew Flinders, who was tasked with circumnavigating the Australian continent. The Aboriginal sailor Bungaree also joined this expedition. Nanbaree sailed north on Investigator, but at the Whitsunday Islands he returned to Sydney on board the damaged HMS Lady Nelson after becoming homesick.\n\n\n== Later life and death ==\nIn the 1800s, Nanbaree increasingly associated himself with Bennelong and the remnant people of various clans that grouped themselves with him. They resided mostly on the northern banks of the Parramatta River at a place called Kissing Point. Bennelong and Nanbaree were well acquainted with naval officers who had been granted land there, such as Henry Waterhouse and William Kent. However, over time they became most closely associated with the convict land-holder, James Squire who established Australia's first brewery near Kissing Point. Squire let Bennelong, Nanbaree and the other members of the group live a relatively free lifestyle on his property. Boorong, who grew up with Nanbaree in their adoptive childhood, also resided with them as Bennelong's wife.\nBennelong and Boorong died in 1813, with Squire giving them a formal burial and grave on the Kissing Point property. Nanbaree died in August 1821 and previously had asked that Squire bury him alongside Bennelong and Boorong, a request which the brewer fulfilled. It is probable that Nanbaree was injured in a ritual fight in the days before his death and at that time he had a wife and daughter.\nThe location of the grave of Bennelong, Boorong and Nanbaree was lost until rediscovered in more recent times as being under a residential property at 25 Watson Street in the riverside suburb of Putney. The Government of New South Wales purchased the property in 2018 with the aim of developing it into a place of commemoration.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Indigenous Australian historical figures\n\n\n== References ==",

On 18 November 2023, he made his senior debut for the club in a 2–0 win over Houilles AC in the seventh round of the Coupe de France. Replacing Yahia Fofana during his absence due to the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, Zinga played in his first match against a professional side on 6 January 2024, a 1–0 loss away to Brest in the Coupe de France round of 64.\n\n\n== International career ==\nZinga is a France youth international. He won Lafarge Foot Avenir in 2019 and the Maurice Revello Tournament in 2022 with the under-18 and under-20 teams respectively.\n\n\n== Player profile ==\nZinga has earned the nickname \"kamikaze\" among his teammates for his tendency to make daring challenges. In 2023, Angers goalkeeping coach Olivier Tingry said that he is \"dynamic, tonic, and rather skillful with his feet\", adding that \"he is good on his line and has a good vision of the game\".\nIn 2019, Zinga stated that he was a fan of Spanish club Barcelona, and that his football role model was Marc-André ter Stegen.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nFrance U18\n\nLafarge Foot Avenir: 2019\nFrance U20\n\nMaurice Revello Tournament: 2022\n\n\n== References ==",

Unlike other similar annals, it was not written during the period it chronicles, but rather in the second half of the 16th century. Gottskálksannáll. Despite the fact that these annals were written later on, they provide a significant amount of information about events in the 14th century, including details about monastic culture, especially between 1300 and 1394. However, given that these accounts were written after the fact, their contents must be considered cautiously. Some speculate that the entries from between 636 and 1394 come from annals that are now lost.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEldbjørg Haug, The Icelandic Annals as Historical Sources, 1997",

        "content": "Kristina Archena Baehr (née Scurry, born 1980 or 1981) is an American trial attorney who specializes in bringing class actions on behalf of people who allege they were poisoned by environmental toxins. She has brought several lawsuits representing victims of the Red Hill water crisis at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam on Oahu.\n\n\n== Early life, education and career ==\nKristina Scurry was born to Pamela M. Scurry and Richardson G. Scurry Jr.; her father worked for an investment firm in Purchase, New York, and co-founded the Bible Literacy Project. She graduated from Princeton University and Yale Law School. At Yale, she authored a law review comment that examined the effect of mandatory minimum sentencing of sex crimes in South African criminal law. She argued that the existing structure favored judicial consideration of mitigating factors and should be replaced with a framework centered on aggravators. In 2007, she married fellow Princeton alumnus Evan Baehr. \nBaehr began her career with the Carter Center helping the Liberian Ministry of Justice launch a sex crimes prosecution unit. She was then a clerk for federal district judge Nancy Gertner. The Baehrs moved to Austin, Texas, where they had four children and where Kristina joined McKool Smith as a corporate litigator.\nBaehr believes that she and her children were being harmed by indoor \"toxic mold\", which is considered a myth by experts. The Baehrs said they spent $700,000 on home mold remediation.\nIn 2021, the Baehrs, represented by counsel, sued 11 builders and contractors involved in their home's construction. All but one defendant settled prior to trial. In August 2023, a Travis County jury proportionally awarded $3.1 million to the Baehrs from the remaining defendant, an HVAC contractor.\n\n\n== Environmental law career ==\nAfter finding that few Texas attorneys specialized in environmental toxic torts, Baehr in 2021 founded a boutique law firm called Just Well Law to focus on this area of practice.\n\n\n=== Red Hill water crisis ===\n\nAfter CNBC featured her in a 2021 segment, Baehr said that she received many calls, including from Hawaii, where military families at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam claimed serious harms from tap water contaminated by a jet fuel leak. In 2022, Just Well Law and local counsel filed suit in federal court on behalf of military families and civilians who claimed harm from the leak. The number of claimants grew over the next year, reaching 7,500 represented by Just Well Law in three separate cases. The suits were filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\nSome of the plaintiffs against the Navy in the Red Hill litigation are active-duty service members. Although the Feres doctrine bars most tort claims by active-duty personnel, Baehr has argued that it cannot be used to bar claims by service members for injuries they suffered off duty in their own homes.\nA bellwether trial for a limited number of plaintiffs began on April 29, 2024. Media outlets have described Baehr as \"lead counsel\" for the plaintiffs. The U.S. government admitted to liability for negligence at the fuel storage facility and that residents using the water line suffered injury. Baehr described the government's stipulation to liability as \"historic\". The trial is set to determine the extent of harm experienced by plaintiffs and whether the government failed to warn residents of the military base.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLaw firm profile page",

        "content": "\"Ordinary\" is a song by American rapper PnB Rock featuring American rapper Pop Smoke.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nAmerican rapper PnB Rock released his sophomore album TrapStar Turnt PopStar in 2019, with it hitting number four on the US Billboard 200. In January 2020, PnB Rock became involved in a street race in Burbank, California, and crashed his car into other parked vehicles, injuring two people in the process. He was arrested for driving under the influence and reckless driving. American rapper Pop Smoke released his sophomore mixtape Meet the Woo 2 on February 7, 2020. Less than a week later, he released a deluxe version of the mixtape featuring new songs and remixes, including \"Like Me\" featuring PnB Rock. PnB Rock released \"Ordinary\" on February 12, 2020, featuring Pop Smoke. It was PnB Rock's first release since \"Fundi\" with Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz in 2019. Just days after the track was released, on February 19, 2020, Pop Smoke was shot and killed at the age of 20 during a home invasion.\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n\"Ordinary\" is a drill song. The staff of BrooklynVegan mentioned \"Ordinary\" went in a \"darker, harder direction\", compared to PnB Rocks other music. Patrick Johnson of Hypebeast stated the song featured Pop Smoke's \"signature raspy delivery\" over an \"ominous and hard-hitting beat\". \"Ordinary\" begins with Pop Smoke saying \"woo\" numerous times and rapping in the first half of the song, with PnB Rock then rapping for the rest of the song. Lyrically, PnB Rock and Pop Smoke rap about different luxury brands they own in the chorus and during their respective verses.\n\n\n== Performances and critical reception ==\nPnB Rock performed \"Ordinary\" live in Philadelphia on February 16, 2020. The staff of WQHT said the track is \"fire\", with Trace William Cowen for Complex saying the song \"pairs nicely\" with \"Like Me\". Alex Zidel of HotNewHipHop called it \"boisterous\", mentioning that both rappers were \"proving to be quite the formidable duo\". Writing for Revolt, Jon Powell described \"Ordinary\" as a \"hard-hitting release\" and \"infectious\", saying PnB Rock and Pop Smoke had \"obvious chemistry\" and that they needed to collaborate on more music.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Portmán is a locality of the Region of Murcia located to the south of the municipality of La Unión at the foot of the mining mountain range of Cartagena-La Unión in a bay bathed by the Mediterranean Sea.\nIts territory has a very rugged topography, surrounded by mountains that surround the coastal plain, where the population center is located. To the north is the Sancti Spiritu hill, 434 meters high, which is the highest point of the entity, with Fortuna hill further south and the Cabezo de las Lajas, 283 meters above sea level. To the west are located the cabezo of El Pino (271 m above sea level) and the cabezo of La Galera (177 m above sea level), whose slopes plunge towards the Mediterranean Sea; to the east are the Peña del Águila (387 m above sea level) and the Monte de las Cenizas (307 m above sea level), integrated in the regional park of Calblanque, Monte de las Cenizas and Peña del Águila. About 3 kilometers from the town, on a promontory to the east of the Portmán inlet, stands the lighthouse of the same name.\n\n\n== Toponymy ==\nIt was founded by the Romans in the first century, with the name of Portus Magnus (Large Port), origin of its current toponymy.\nIn Arab times it was called Burtuman Al-Kabir (Burtuman the Great).\n\nLater, in the 14th century, in the hunting book of Alfonso XI of Castile it appears as Porte Mayn.\"In the land of Cartagena there are these mountains (...) The Sierra de Porte Mayn is a good pork mountain in winter, and in these mountains there are these springs, the Fuente del Cañaveral, the Fuente del Porte Mayn. The mountain of Cabo de Palos is a very good mountain for pork in winter, and this mountain is near the sea. And near this mountain is an island, which enters the sea: and it is well over a league long, and there are many deer on it\".\nBook of the hunting of Alfonso XI of Castile. 14th century.The first reference to the current name appears in a book of Cabildos of the City Council of Cartagena in 1590.\nIt shares the origin of its etymology with the municipality of San Antonio Abad (in Catalan: Sant Antoni de Portmany) on the island of Ibiza.\n\n\n== History ==\nIts location, as a natural port near the mines of Cartagena and La Unión, made it a strategic enclave in Roman times. There are numerous remains of Roman mining and industrial facilities for smelting ore throughout the area.\nWith the new mining boom in the mid-19th century began a new period of great splendor until the mid-20th century.\nIn 1860 it separated from the municipality of Cartagena to become part of what would later become the municipality of La Unión.\nThere are numerous events and celebrations that this district celebrates throughout the year and among them highlights the festival in honor of its patron saint James the Great on July 25, not forgetting the traditional procession of the Virgen del Carmen on July 16, Carnival, Easter and the Portman Theatre Festival which has two editions (December and June), organized by the company PortmanTeatro, which receives in each edition numerous theatrical successes both in the Region of Murcia and other companies in the rest of Spain.\nFor many years, Portmán's economy was based on mining, fishing and tourism. Nowadays the inhabitants of Portmán find employment opportunities in culture and ecotourism.\nOn August 18, 2011, a serious fire originated in the residential complex La Manga Golf spread rapidly towards the Regional Park of Calblanque, Monte de las Cenizas and Peña del Águila. Arson was suspected.\n\n\n== Beaches ==\nPortmán has two main beaches, Playa de San Bruno (the pedestrian beach of the bay) and Playa del Lastre. Next to the Playa de El Gorguel, in the direction of La Unión, is the Playa or Cala de Cola de Caballo.\n\n\n== Climatology ==\nThe summers are very hot (the average in July and August is 37-38 °C), and in winter the minimum temperature does not drop below 8 °C. The annual average is 16-18 °C.\nThe annual maximum pressure is 970.5 hPa and the minimum 941.2. It rains the most in autumn, less in winter and spring. The average annual rainfall is only 323 mm, although the mist and marine humidity help the existing vegetation a lot.\nWinds usually blow from the southwest (dry libeccio) and in autumn from the east or northeast (levant), which brings clouds and rain. In autumn there is also sometimes a libeccio or northwesterly wind, which clears the sky of clouds.\nIn summer, the strong winds send a certain coolness to the mountains, and when it blows from the south, coming from Africa, the heat lashes the area.\n\n\n== Archaeological and architectural heritage ==\nThe intense exploitation of the Sierra Minera de Cartagena since Roman times has left numerous archaeological remains throughout the area.\n\nThe great Roman Villa of Paturro was discovered in the vicinity of the town, between the boundaries of the municipalities of Cartagena and La Union and was linked to the mining operations of the town.\nIn the Archaeological Museum of La Unión are preserved numerous remains of mining and smelting of minerals from Roman times, highlighting the mosaics of the Roman Villa of Paturro.\nCasa del Tío Lobo, also known as Casa Zapata de Portmán or Casa Grande de Portmán, owned by the wealthy mining businessman Miguel Zapata Sáez, currently declared of cultural interest (BIC). It was built at the end of the 19th century and initially had only one floor. In 1913 the architect Víctor Beltrí made the project to add the second floor, turning it into a building in the style of a \"little French hotel\". The ground floor housed the offices and the upper floor the living quarters.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Environmental problems ==\nThe destruction of the bay and port of Portmán, south of the municipality of La Unión, has been one of the greatest ecological attacks in the Mediterranean.\nSince the beginning of its exploitation, in 1957, of the pyrites of the Sierra Minera, the company SMM Peñarroya-España produced enormous quantities of mineral debris, the result of the open-pit extraction methods it used as a way of reducing costs. They have been calculated at some 315 million tons of mineral tailings between 1957 and 1987, the date of closure of the mines. In the early stages, this waste was deposited at the foot of the quarries, forming large pits, swamps, etc., which have destroyed the original landscape of the Sierra. However, the biggest problem came from the residues from the washing of the materials used to obtain the ore. Due to its fluidity and volume, it was highly costly to deposit it in ponds or swamps.\n\nIn view of this, and even before starting the exploitation, the French company Peñarroya, proposed the option of reducing costs by throwing the tailings from its washes directly into the Mediterranean Sea. Since 1950 it applied to the coastal authorities for a permit for these discharges, which was denied on two occasions, in 1954 and 1957. The authorities took into account the toxicity of the discharges and the turbidity that would be caused in the water, with the consequent loss of fishing resources.\nHowever, in January 1958 the authorities changed their mind after meetings with company representatives. The discharges would be allowed under certain conditions: that the discharges would be made by submarine pipeline, at least 400 meters from the coast; that it would be a temporary solution (5 years), that the fishermen would be compensated; that the number of washes and their capacity would not be increased unless tailings storage ponds were built on land; and that if environmental damage was demonstrated, the discharges would be stopped.\nThese measures were not complied with. In 1961, by ministerial order of November 8, 1961, the distance from the coast was reduced to 250 meters and the limitations were reduced, under the theory that the currents would push them towards the open sea, which was manifestly false.\nIn 1965 the effects of the spills began to be felt. The company itself admitted internally that Portmán Bay would soon be silted up and that a new strategy would be necessary to continue disposing of the tailings at sea. The solution they found was to consider the irrelevance of Portmán as a port.\nIn fact, since 1966, the General Directorate of Ports considered the closure, or at least the reduction of the discharges, in view of the progressive unusability of the Portmán port, considered a port of refuge, and the dredging of the port was demanded to the responsible company. In 1967, complaints were repeated from the Murcia Mining Department. In response to this, Peñarroya made timid attempts to dredge the bay.\n\nHowever, the company is considering expanding mineral production by opening new quarries in the Sierra, expanding the capacity of its washing facilities. In a key decision, it develops a clear strategy, requesting the annulment of Portmán's declaration as a port of refuge and permission to expand the volume of discharges. In exchange, it offered to cede land to build a new port at Cabo de Palos. In June 1967, after meetings with the City Council of Cartagena (which has no jurisdiction over Portmán but does have jurisdiction over Cabo de Palos), and with the Port Authority of Murcia, the final offer was made: the land for the construction of the dock at Cabo de Palos plus 4,000,000 pesetas at the time as compensation. The offer is presented as being promoted by the residents of Cabo de Palos, whom the company will \"graciously\" help. In exchange, the abandonment of Portmán is requested. It is the moment when the tourist urbanization of La Manga is about to begin, supported by the Ministry of Information and Tourism.\nThen the first public reaction against the dumping appeared. The mayor of La Unión sent a letter to the provincial governor, in which the offer of the French multinational was presented as the total disappearance of this mining and fishing town, and would deprive the Municipality of a source of exploitation, for tourism, the only resource that would be left when the deposits were exhausted. The protest fell on deaf ears. On December 15, 1967, an order was published which annulled the dredging works, obliging Peñarroya to reduce the impact of the discharges. Shortly afterwards, on July 21, 1969, an order from the Ministry of Public Works eliminated all limits on the dumping of mineral tailings into the sea.\nIn July 1968, the company Peñarroya-España was incorporated, with a 2% shareholding in its board of directors, with strong ties to the power centers of Franco's regime. In addition, the French company had the ability to mix its interests with those of the City Council of Cartagena, with those of the promoters who were beginning their expansion in La Manga (such as Tomás Maestre Aznar) and with the expansionist policy of the Ministry of Information and Tourism. Precisely at the time of publication of the ministerial order, the company contributed the land on which the port of Cabo de Palos was to be built, plus 25,000,000 pesetas for its construction. The expected profits would be higher. In fact, the agreement allowed the exit of a profit strangulation and the beginning of a process of great growth in production. This can be seen in the value of the lead production of the Peñarroya smelter in Saint Lucia.\n\nAn attempt to publicize the reality in the press, in the Madrid newspaper Pueblo, was stopped by \"pressure from above\".\nThe Town Council of La Unión then lodged an appeal for reconsideration with the Ministry of Public Works, which was rejected, followed by an appeal to the courts. On December 21, 1971, the Supreme Court ruled definitively. In the sentence, it recognized the validity of the reasons of the City Council of La Unión, but ruled in favor of the Peñarroya company, in a resolution that was considered to be typical of the late phase of the dictatorship. From that moment on, the discharges were uncontrolled.\nWith the arrival of democracy, the controversy flared up again in the local press in 1977. But again the \"pressures\" succeeded in silencing the issue. Not even the actions of some politicians in 1977-78 achieved anything, in the face of the influence and pressures, there has even been talk of bribes from the Peñarroya company. In 1978 the company obtained permits to increase the volume of discharges, despite the fact that at this time the toxicity of the tailings dumped was already well known, both for the high concentration of heavy metals (cadmium, lead), and for the presence of toxic products used in the washing of the ore (copper sulfate, sodium cyanide, zinc sulfate, sulfuric acid, among others) that many years after the cessation of mining activity continues to affect the health of the inhabitants.\n\nIn 1979, the ministry hit the bay again when it allowed the discharges of another mineral washery, the 'Lavadero Eugenia', to be connected to the same pipe of the 'Roberto' washery.\nFrom 1980 onwards, social and journalistic pressure increased. In 1986 there was even an action by the international environmental association Greenpeace, with some of its members chaining themselves to the waste pipes.\nFrom the beginning of the 1980s, the mining activity went into losses. In addition, both at the political level, especially since 1982, with plans for the regeneration of the bay, and at the social level, a definitive solution is beginning to be demanded. There are also labor problems, due to the workers' fear of losing their jobs. The attempts to extend the mining exploitation to new quarries clashed with the radical opposition of the neighbors of Llano del Beal, in 1987–88.\nIn this context, Peñarroya looked for a way out, and in the midst of negotiations opened on different fronts (stoppage of dumping, obligation to recover Portmán Bay, promises to maintain the activity, requests to extend the exploitations), on September 20, 1988, SMM Peñarroya (financed by the Rothschild Bank), disappeared from the scene, acquiring its properties the company Portmán Golf, which put an end to the mining activity that had been developed by SMM Peñarroya under the protection of the Administration.\n\n\n=== Natural disaster in Portmán Bay ===\nIn the last two decades the need for the regeneration of the Bay has become more evident, which has led to the local and regional organization of the administration, as well as a league of neighbors, to request investment funds from the state government to restore and clean its waters. The final approval of the project, at national and European level, takes place in 2011 and involves the investment of 79,402,304 million euros by the Ministry of Environment. But after the change of government in December of the same year, the situation has been in retreat, occurring in 2012 a withdrawal of the contracting process from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Environment, leaving the claims of the hamlet in a deadlock.\n\n\n=== Current works ===\nAfter reaching an agreement expected for decades, finally Portmán Bay is now a site under construction, which has caused discomfort.\nThe landscape that is currently observed when strolling through the bay is dominated by two rafts/boats, theoretically waterproofed and whose construction is already completed, which block the view of the bay. These rafts will become the place where, in the future, the tailings removed will be dredged and subsequently transferred to the Corta San José quarry, where precisely part of them came from in the past.\nIn addition, work has already begun on the construction of a third pond, which will complete the volume required for the tailings to be removed from the Bay for drying. This natural site holds two million cubic meters of tailings.\nThe ponds are necessary for the drying process, taking into account that the dredged material is made up of 75 percent water and 25 percent sand and heavy metals.\nThis is one of the projects, the implementation of which started in October 2016. Authorities and technicians announced that for the following year a conveyor belt would be installed to run from the old port to a cut to transport the already dried tailings, which has not been carried out due to the environmental risk.\nThe dredging of the bay may cause high toxicity.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nThere is a 2001 documentary film directed by Miguel Martí, entitled Portmán, a la sombra de Roberto with images and interviews that show the environmental disaster of the town and the Sierra Minera and the neighborhood conflict for the survival of Llano del Beal in the 80's of the 20th century.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMar Menor\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMontes, Ricardo; Zapata, Antonio J.

        "content": "Urceolus cornutus is a species of heterotrophic flagellates present in marine environments. Described in 1990 by Jacob Larsen and David Patterson from sediment samples off the coast of Fiji, it is distinguished from other species by very fine and compact pellicle stripes that follow an S-helix shape, and a collar with a regular or symmetrical outline.\n\n\n== Description ==\nUrceolus cornutus is a species of flagellate, a unicellular eukaryote or protist that moves with one emergent flagellum for movement, present in the anterior region of the cell. Like other species of the genus Urceolus, the flagellum and a feeding groove are located in a canal with an anterior neck-like opening surrounded by a neck-like aperture. No second flagellum has been observed, but is probably located within the canal. In particular, U. cornutus cells are broadly sack-shaped, 27–50 μm long and 10–20 μm wide. Their neck is 12–20 μm in diameter, with a regular outline. The flagellum is equal in length or slightly longer than the cell. The pellicle stripes, characteristic of euglenids, are delicate and closely spaced, in the shape of an S-helix and reaching into the collar. The feeding apparatus or ingestion organelle, located at the base of the canal, is well-developed and is composed of two microtubular rods. The canal itself opens subapically. The nucleus is located at the posterior end of the cell.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nUrceolus cornutus is a phagotrophic protist inhabiting marine sediment, where it feeds on microalgae. It was discovered in Laucala Bay, Fiji, but has also been recorded in other marine sites, such as the coast of Sydney, Australia, the Oslofjord in Norway, and off the coast of Cantabria, Spain.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe species Urceolus cornutus was described by protistologists Jacob Larsen and David Patterson in a 1990 study of flagellates from tropical marine sediments, published in the Journal of Natural History. It was found at Laucala Bay, Fiji.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Atlantic Hockey America (AHA) is a college ice hockey conference which operates primarily in the northeastern United States. It participates in NCAA Division I as an ice hockey-only conference. The  conference was formed by the merger of the men-only Atlantic Hockey Association and the women-only College Hockey America (CHA).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2010, the men's division of CHA collapsed and two of the remaining teams joined the Atlantic Hockey Association. At that time, the two leagues began working together by sharing a commissioner and administrative staff in order to streamline their operating costs. The arrangement worked well enough that by 2023, the two entities decided to formalize their relationship and announced that they were merging. The new league would begin in the 2024–25 season and would welcome a new member, Delaware, the following year.\n\n\n== Membership ==\nThree schools, Mercyhurst, RIT and Robert Morris, have programs in both the men's and women's divisions. Holy Cross, Lindenwood, Penn State and Sacred Heart each operate teams of both sexes, but only one is a member of AHA. Niagara and Syracuse only have one varsity program active as of 2024 but both previously supported the other gender.\n\n\n=== Current ===\nConference affiliations are current for the first season of the merged AHA in 2024–25.\n\n\n=== Future ===\nPrimary conference affiliation is current for the first season of AHA play.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n  Men     Women     Both  \n\n\n== Champions ==\n\n\n== Conference arenas ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nAtlantic Hockey\nCollege Hockey America\nMAAC Awards\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAtlantic Hockey Online",

        "content": "\"Unsung Hero\" is a song written by Australian singer Tina Arena collaborating with Dean McTaggart, and David Tyson. It was originally recorded by Arena for her fourth studio album In Deep (1997), which was released on 18 August 1997 through Columbia Records. The song was produced by Mick Jones and David Tyson. It was not released as a single from the album.\nThe song was covered by Canadian country music artist Terri Clark for her third studio album How I Feel (1998). \n\n\n== Terri Clark version ==\n\nCanadian country music artist Terri Clark recorded a cover of the song for her third studio album How I Feel (1998). Clark's version was produced by Keith Stegall. It was released on 24 May 1999, as the fourth and final single from the album.\nClark's version hit number 47 on the US Hot Country Songs chart and peaked at number 15 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks.\n\n\n=== Content ===\nClark said that producer Keith Stegall told her it was the most expensive vocals he had ever recorded. When recording the cover, Clark thought of her mother, saying \"When my mom heard it, she started to cry. She is so close to me. I probably think of her more than anybody when I sing this song.\"\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nBillboard magazine gave the single a positive review by saying, \"Clark once again turns in a solid performance, while producer Keith Stegall accomplishes exactly what we have come to expect from him. The lyric, in spirit of \"Wind Beneath My Wings\", pays homage to the strong silent type who has always stood by, allowing a partner to take the spotlight.\" They ended their review by saying \"Clark's rendition will likely generate strong airplay, thanks to her current status at country radio.\"\n\n\n=== Commercial performance ===\n\"Unsung Hero\" debuted on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart the week of 29 May 1999, at number 60. In its fifth week, the song reached its peak of number 47. It stayed 10 weeks on the chart.\nThe song debuted at number 82 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart the week of 14 June 1999. In its seventh week, it reached its peak position of number 15 on 26 July 1999. It spent 17 weeks on the chart.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\n\n\n=== Charts ===\n\n\n=== Release history ===\n\n\n== References ==",

Operating under Unix-like systems, it uses finite-difference time-domain method with perfectly matched layer or periodic boundary conditions for field computation. \nMeep supports dispersive, nonlinear and anisotropic media, and features subpixel smoothing and parallelization, as well as an embedded frequency-domain solver for steady-state fields and eigenmode expansion. The package was subsequently expanded to include an adjoint solver for topology optimization and inverse design, and a Python interface.\nThe software is widely adopted by optics and photonics communities, with applications including the analysis and design of metalenses and photonic crystals.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nComparison of EM simulation software\nList of computer simulation software\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nmeep on GitHub",

        "content": "The APCA Television Award (Portuguese: Prêmio APCA de Televisão) is one of the areas covered by the APCA Award, a traditional Brazilian award created in 1956 by the São Paulo Association of Theater Critics (now the São Paulo Association of Art Critics). Television became part of the APCA Awards in 1972. Until then, it only awarded theater and classical music. In the same year, film, literature and popular music were also recognized. New areas were incorporated into the competition over the following years.\nThe winners of the APCA Award are chosen between the end of November and the beginning of December during a meeting of APCA member critics. Some categories may include a six-monthly pre-selection of finalists according to demand. Each critic votes exclusively within their area of expertise, selecting a maximum of seven categories in each area, which may change each year according to the critics' perception of the most pertinent in each period. There is also a requirement that a minimum of three critics from each area be present at the vote, which can mean that certain categories are not awarded in some years due to a lack of quorum. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the winners of the 65th edition of the APCA Awards were determined in January 2021. Each area had fewer categories than in previous years. The television area had six categories instead of seven, while in most areas the reduction was to three categories.\n\n\n== Main categories ==\nAPCA Award for Best Telenovela;\nAPCA Award for Best Television Actress;\nAPCA Award for Best Television Actor;\nAPCA Award for Best Breakthrough Actor;\nAPCA Award for Best Breakthrough Actress;\nAPCA Award for Best Supporting Actor;\nAPCA Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n\n== Winners by Year ==\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\n\n==== 1972 ====\n\n\n==== 1973 ====\n\n\n==== 1974 ====\n\n\n==== 1975 ====\n\n\n==== 1976 ====\n\n\n==== 1977 ====\n\n\n==== 1978 ====\n\n\n==== 1979 ====\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\n\n==== 1980 ====\n\n\n==== 1981 ====\n\n\n==== 1982 ====\n\n\n==== 1983 ====\n\n\n==== 1984 ====\n\n\n==== 1985 ====\n\n\n==== 1987 ====\n\n\n==== 1988 ====\n\n\n==== 1989 ====\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\n\n==== 1990 ====\n\n\n==== 1991 ====\n\n\n==== 1992 ====\n\n\n==== 1993 ====\n\n\n==== 1994 ====\n\n\n==== 1995 ====\n\n\n==== 1996 ====\n\n\n==== 1997 ====\n\n\n==== 1998 ====\n\n\n==== 1999 ====\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\n\n==== 2000 ====\n\n\n==== 2001 ====\n\n\n==== 2002 ====\n\n\n==== 2003 ====\n\n\n==== 2004 ====\n\n\n==== 2005 ====\n\n\n==== 2006 ====\n\n\n==== 2007 ====\n\n\n==== 2008 ====\n\n\n==== 2009 ====\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\n\n\n==== 2010 ====\n\n\n==== 2011 ====\n\n\n==== 2012 ====\n\n\n==== 2013 ====\n\n\n==== 2014 ====\n\n\n==== 2015 ====\n\nVoting: Bárbara Sacchitiello, Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Flávio Ricco, José Armando Vanucci, Leão Lobo, Neuber Fischer and Nilson Xavier.\n\n\n==== 2016 ====\n\nVoting: Bárbara Sacchitiello, Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente, Fábio Maksymczuk, Flávio Ricco, José Armando Vanucci, Neuber Fischer, Leão Lobo, Nilson Xavier and Paulo Gustavo Pereira.\n\n\n==== 2017 ====\n\nVoting: Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Flávio Ricco, José Armando Vanucci, Leão Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Nilson Xavier and Paulo Gustavo.\n\n\n==== 2018 ====\n\nVoting: Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Flávio Ricco, Leão Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Nilson Xavier and Paulo Gustavo Pereira.\n\n\n==== 2019 ====\n\nVoting: Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Flávio Ricco, Leão Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Nilson Xavier and Tony Goes.\n\n\n=== 2020s ===\n\n\n==== 2020 ====\n\nVoting: Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Leão Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Paulo Gustavo Pereira and Tony Goes.\n\n\n==== 2021 ====\n\nVoting: Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, Leão Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Paulo Gustavo Pereira and Tony Goes.\n\n\n==== 2022 ====\n\nVoting: Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente (except for the Best Documentary Series category), Fabio Maksymczuk, Leão Lobo and Tony Goes.\n\n\n==== 2023 ====\n\nVoting: Cristina Padiglione, Edianez Parente, Fabio Maksymczuk, José Armando Vannucci, Leão Lobo, Neuber Fischer, Paulo Gustavo Pereira and Tony Goes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMelhores do Ano Troféu Domingão\nMeus Prêmios Nick\nTroféu Imprensa\n\n\n== References ==",
