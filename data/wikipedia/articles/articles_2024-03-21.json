        "content": "The 1927–28 Spanish Football League was the first attempt to organize a league championship in Spain in the 1927–28 Spanish season. However, numerous discrepancies arose in its organization and within the teams that participated, which is why it was divided into two competitions, with neither of which being concluded, called Torneo de Campeones and Liga Profesional de Clubs de Football or Liga Máxima. At the time the competition stopped, its first classified teams were FC Barcelona and Racing de Santander, respectively.\nThe Torneo de Campeones was made up of the so-called \"maximalist\", the most influential clubs that had been winners of the Spanish Regional Championships and the Copa del Rey; while the Liga Máxima, the \"minimalist\", made up of the rest of the clubs that advocated free competition at the professionalized national level. However, as they evolved, these meanings reversed among themselves, with the reports and chronicles referring to the \"maximalists\" as those who made up the Liga Máxima, with the largest number of participants, and the \"minimalists\" as those of the Torneo de Campeones.\nIt was designed to be played as a league tournament contested by 16 clubs between September 1927 and July 1928. Initially, equality was advocated for all the clubs, but the Copa del Rey champions did not agree to it, so the clubs were divided into two competitions, eight in the Liga Profesional and the six champions of the Copa del Rey, who established the Union of Football Clubs, decided not to participate and formed the Torneo de Campeones, in addition to two included at the last minute, RCD Espanyol by invitation and CA Osasuna that entered after the creation of the Navarra Football Federation. This division thus postponed the common and consensual birth of a national championship. Although neither of those two competitions was concluded, they were the precursor and the forerunner to La Liga, which began the following season.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\n\n=== Division into two championships ===\nUntil 1927, the only official competitions that the Spanish football clubs played were their corresponding regional championships and the Copa del Rey, in addition to other local tournaments or friendly matches. With professionalization of football in Spain already regulated since 1926, the clubs had found themselves in the need to obtain greater box office income to meet the increasingly high demands of their main figures and survive financially. The regional championships were hardly profitable for the leading teams, since their stadiums were only filled in the matches of maximum rivalry, so in order to be able to cover the increasingly expensive signings and expenses of each society, the clubs began to discuss the possibility of creating a national professional league that would be more competitive and profitable than the existing championships. In short, the aim was to attract a greater audience and therefore leave greater benefits for the clubs.\nThe first major change in this regard began to take shape in 1926 when, after a long process of debate, the clubs approved the Regulations of Spanish Professional Football. Following the British model, the first step towards professionalism was taken, laying the foundations for the birth of a championship that would attest to this.\nWhen the creation of this league tournament was finally decided, the discussion focused on the number of participants, which caused a division in two: that of the clubs that wanted a league formed exclusively by the teams that had once won the Copa del Rey, and that of those that wanted the league to be opened to more teams. In the end, after many discussions, and in the absence of agreement, two parallel tournaments were held, that of the \"maximalists\", with the distinguished teams who had won the Copa del Rey (Athletic Bilbao, Madrid FC, FC Barcelona, Real Unión, and Arenas Club), or their heirs, since the five champions included Real Sociedad thanks to the title of the Club Ciclista, and that of the \"minimalists\", with the teams that had not achieved any cup feat, which was initially formed by five teams (Racing de Santander, Celta de Vigo, Sporting de Gijón, Valencia FC, and Sevilla FC), plus those excluded by the champions, RCD Español and Atlético Madrid. The six Copa del Rey winners then formed the Champions Union and began advocating the celebration of a League among its members, closed off to the rest. In response, the Professional Football Club League was created to form a larger league tournament, hosting a greater number of participants. Both groups became known as \"Minimalists\" and \"Maximalists\" respectively, according to the type of competition they defended.\nThese discrepancies to integrate what was already called the \"tournament of the six\", or Torneo de Campeones, caused them to be branded as \"anti-ligists\" even though they had wanted a tournament with a common league format. The remaining seven clubs began the negotiations for what they called the Liga Profesional or Liga Máxima, allowing the inclusion of each regional champion, and ultimately the CA Osasuna, the sole representative of the Navarrese federation. Thus, they promoted a meeting at the federative level held on 20 September 1927 with the following representatives: the Federation of Galicia representing the Celta de Vigo and Deportivo de La Coruña; the Federation of Asturias for Sporting de Gijón and Unión Deportivo Racing, both from Gijón; the Cantabria Federation for Racing de Santander and Montaña Sport; the Valencia Federation for the Valencia FC, Atlético Saguntino, and CD Castellón; the Murcia Federation for the Real Murcia FC, the Cartagena FC, and the River Thader of Murcia; the Centro Federation for Atlético Madrid and the Unión Sporting Club of Madrid; the Federation of Castile and León for the Club Deportivo Español of Valladolid; the Aragon Federation for the Iberia SC of Zaragoza; and the Federation of Andalusia for the Sevilla FC, the Real Betis, the Málaga FC, and the FC Malagueño.\nThe members of the Liga Máxima began to be called \"maximalists\", due to their greater number of teams, unlike until then, thus reversing the original meanings of those terms. The formation of the first group of the \"maximalist\" was quickly followed by the group of the Liga Profesional, but not without attempting the final union of the maximum number of clubs, when the ten clubs that would form a common professional league invited the six champion clubs of Spain to join, but they failed to reach a successful outcome since their tournament had already begun, so the Liga Profesional was also definitively formed.\nWith both championships in progress, the \"maximalists\" agreed on 11 April 1928 to enter CA Osasuna into the league, thus modifying the calendar, in addition to re-recruiting RCD Español, which did not compete at the beginning, in addition to accepting other clubs also after the fact that finally did not play, possibly because the Torneo de Campeones was flowing better and it was already planning the inclusion of all those remaining clubs in a new edition, dividing them by divisions.\nIn view of the better development of the Torneo de Campeones, their \"rivals\" planned a next cup tournament among all the professional clubs, and up to a total of sixteen, which would be added to those that already made up the Liga Máxima, and even offered the same possibility of making a partition into two divisions, even seeking protection from the Royal Spanish Football Federation, without seeming to come to fruition due to the instability it suffered and which only predicted the breakup of Spanish football. Subsequently, these divisions continued to be talked about by forming the two divisions of the already established 1928-29 championship, under the name of First and Second Division.\n\n\n== Professional League ==\n\n\n=== Planning ===\nA League is a sports competition in which all the teams or participants of the same category compete against each other, with the winner being the one with the greatest number of points. We must change the perspective of the current league concept, since in this case, the first time in Spain, confrontations between equals were taken into account, without a global sense of completing all the games. The minimalist league tournament was a closed league without relegation. Initially, 3 points were awarded to the winner and one to the loser. Subsequently, a more usual score is collected, granting two points for a victory, one for a draw, and none for a defeat. The champion team would be the one that at the end of the season had obtained the most points. Some games were played in locations that were neither the \"home\" team nor the \"visitor\" team. For the Spanish Federation, the league was official since its constitution was provided for in its statutes, although this was not the case for its matches. We are facing a professional competition, at the state level and with tacit recognition by the federation. The teams that had been champions of Spain were invited, but freely decided not to participate in Spain's first professional league. The matches that were planned were:\n\nOne of the several trophies arranged in contention, presumably to favor the contests, was the one that was announced in the match to be played on 18 September 1927 between Racing and Sporting as a Queen's Cup, which was postponed due to time. There are two Racing-Sporting matches that are awarded to the maximalist league, one in November and the other in June. Racing won both, so we assume they would win the Queen's Cup. A triangular Spring Cup was also played between Español, Athletic de Madrid and Osasuna, after the latter's admission to the League and which the Catalans won.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe Liga Máxima, officially the Professional League of Foot-ball Clubs, began its journey in September 1927. The development of the season was irregular, with some games being played at the beginning of the season, alternating with the regional championships, with the league being interrupted by the development of the Spanish Championship, which had even more \"pull\" for the fans, and more matches being played at the end of the season, until July 1928. By then negotiations had already been resumed between minimalists and maximalists for the establishment of a championship of the league in the 1928-29 season, reaching an agreement. Finally, the Maximum League was left without completing all its matches. In addition, a tournament was held between the clubs eliminated from the Spanish championship, which competed for a very valuable cup (possibly this Sporting 1-2 Osasuna is from this tournament).\nÓscar, international forward for Racing de Santander, scored 4 goals in the match against Celta played in Santander, with a record of goals for the season (Racing 7-4 Celta)​ and also scored 4 goals against Iberia.​ The greatest goal difference was Racing 9-0 Sevilla played in September in Santander (5-0 at half-time and Oscar scored the sixth goal)​ being the goal record of the Racing in an official league match with Racing 9-0 Alavés from the 1932-33 season.\n48 matches were played, some of the 65 planned and others attributed to the League. At the end of 1927 the classification was led by Celta. 40​ At the final moment (considering the Spring Cup and the matches that the press indicated in the League), the qualifying table was as follows according to the usual score:\n\nSegún la puntuación inicial de la Liga (7/10/1927) (que otorgaba 3, 2 y 1 punto), seguramente destinada a fomentar la participación de los equipos y teniendo en cuenta los partidos programados disputados sin los partidos de Osasuna en la Copa Primavera, la clasificación fue:\n\nPts = Puntos; PJ = Partidos Jugados; G = Partidos Ganados; E = Partidos Empatados; P = Partidos Perdidos\nSegún el sistema de puntuación inicial de la Liga más usualmente reflejado en prensa, teniendo en cuenta los partidos programados disputados sin los partidos de Osasuna en la Copa Primavera, la clasificación fue:\n\nPts = Puntos; PJ = Partidos Jugados; G = Partidos Ganados; E = Partidos Empatados; P = Partidos Perdidos\n\n\n=== Matches ===\nLos encuentros disputados hasta la fecha habían sido los siguientes:\n1927\n\n11 de septiembre:\nSporting 4-2 Sevilla (programado)  Confirmado en clasificación\nCelta 5-1 Ath.

Their new songs are rich in harmonies, focus on colourful storytelling, and rip at those all too relatable heartstrings.\nIn June 2023, they went on a successful sold out headline tour across the UK before playing a sold out headline show at New York’s Rockwood Music Hall in July. In the middle of this, their single “Amsterdam” became BBC Radio One’s Introducing Track of the Week, making one of their dreams come true. They also made it onto BBC Radio 2’s playlist and slid into the top 100 airplay in Germany.\nIn 2024, Tors embarked on a major 28-date arena tour of mainland Europe as main support to James Blunt. This run of shows previewed new music which was recorded in Woodstock with producer, Simone Felice (The Lumineers, Noah Kahan, Vance Joy). The tour with James Blunt saw Tors closing in on their mission to craft “intimate, personal songs written to be played in stadiums”, having also toured with Tom Walker, Duncan Laurence, X Ambassadors, Freya Ridings, John Newman, and Sam Ryder.\nThey are set to tour the UK, the US, and mainland Europe in the Summer and Autumn of 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band was founded in Guildford, Surrey by brothers Theo and Matt Weedon, grandsons of influential guitarist Bert Weedon, and Jack Bowden, a drummer whom the brothers recruited via an advert on Gumtree.\nThe band took their name from tors, a type of rock formation commonly found in Dartmoor National Park, after moving to Devon from Guildford.\nOn 5 July 2023, it was announced that Tors had been signed to Glassnote Records.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== As featured artist ===\n\n\n== References ==",

The Jayhawks, members of the Big 12 Conference, will play their home games at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. They will be led by 22nd year Hall of Fame head coach Bill Self.\n\n\n== Offseason ==\n\n\n=== Coaching staff changes ===\nAs of March 2024, no coaches have left Kansas\n\n\n=== Entered NBA draft ===\nPlayers listed below are underclassmen who have entered the 2024 NBA draft. Class provided is class from previous season.\n\n\n=== Graduating players ===\nPlayers listed below were seniors from the previous season who either have run out of eligibility or seniors with an extra year of eligibility due to the COVID-19 pandemic who have not announced a return to the team. Players with an asterisk next to their name still have remaining eligibility and could decide to return to the program but have not declared for their remaining year.\n\n\n=== Returning fifth year seniors ===\nPlayers below are seniors returning for a fifth year.\n\n\n=== Transfers ===\nNo outgoing transfers have been announced as of March 2024.\n\n\n==== Incoming ====\n\n\n=== 2024 recruiting class ===\n\n*ESPN has not made 2024 recruiting class rankings yet\n\n\n== Roster ==\nRoster below is based on the 2023–24 roster with outgoing players removed and incoming players added. The roster will undergo multiple changes as players leave via the NBA draft or transfers and players are added via the transfer portal and recruiting. Heights and weights for new players are based on recruiting profile for freshmen and for transfers they are based on what their listing was at their old school. Heights, weights, and numbers may change before the start of the season as well.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\nThe Jayhawks non-conference schedule will be announced in the summer and the conference schedule will be announced in the fall. Confirmed games include Michigan State in the Champions Classic, a road game against rival Missouri, and an opponent to be determined in the 2024 Big East–Big 12 Battle. Due to tournament format, the Jayhawks will be guaranteed one game in the 2025 Big 12 Tournament. The Big 12 has not yet announced its scheduling formula for the additions of Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, and Utah to the Big 12. Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark has said he intends to have the schedule include 20 games, which would likely mean at least one game against the other 15 Big 12 teams with 5 teams playing each other twice, with priorities being made to rivalries to play twice.\n\n\n== Rankings ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He came to England in the train of his further, the emperor's physician, who had been summoned by Queen Elizabeth. Pressed into the service of the Earl of Leicester, ‘who desired him to pertain unto him,' he continued in the latter's service for many years, both at home and in the Low Countries. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 4 July 1589, being described as ‘vir doctus et practicator bonus.' On the death of Leicester he entered the service of the Earl of Essex, and, by Elizabeth's command, attended him in the wars of France and the expedition to Cadiz. After his return to England he was ordered by Elizabeth to attend Mountjoy in Ireland. He subsequently accompanied, in the same capacity of physician, the Earl of Hertford, the English ambassador to the Archduke of Austria. The rest of his life was spent in private practice. On 12 June 1609 he was incorporated M.D. at Oxford. He died on 3 November 1611, and was buried in the church of St. Clement Danes, London, where a monument, with inscription, was erected to his memory on the south aide of the chancel (see Stow, Survey of London, iv. 113). Otthen married Dorothy, a daughter of Roger Drew of Densworth in Sussex, esquire. After his death she married Sir Stephen Thomhurst of Kent, and died on 12 June 1620, aged 55. She was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, where a monument was erected to her memory.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Shaw, William Arthur (1895). \"Otthen, Hippocrates\".

The magazine Seattle Metropolitan has said it is \"between the Burke-Gilman, the lake, and a boat storage facility\". The restaurant has a deck with Adirondack chairs and views of the lake and city skyline, as well as a fire pit and parking for boats. The restaurant serves American cuisine and seafood. The New York Times has described the food as \"an intriguing mix of Mediterranean and Northwest dishes\", and Thrillist has said the business is \"where chef and restaurateur Renee Erickson's menu hones in on her specialty—seafood—with a Mediterranean twist\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe restaurant opened in 2013. Chef Josh Henderson sold Westward to business partners Chad Dale and Ira Gerlich in 2018. In 2019, Renee Erickson's restaurant group Sea Creatures announced a temporary closure for a remodel, starting in early 2020.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2015, Eater Seattle said Westward was among the city's best restaurants with views. Time Out Seattle rated Westward four out of five stars in 2018.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

        "content": "9: Harmattan & Winter, also known simply as Harmattan & Winter, is the ninth studio album by Nigerian singer Brymo. It was released on September 9, 2021, along with 9: Èsan. The album comprises nine tracks and is a combination of alternative rock, folk, sentimental ballad, and fusion rock. Recorded entirely in English, Harmattan & Winter addresses topics of heartbreak, self-discovery, romance, mental health, and monogamy. Bigfoot produced the entire album, which deviates from Libel's subtle denial and Yellow's hedonistic perspective. The album's title track, \"Harmattan & Winter,\" was made available as a single. Harmattan & Winter received positive reviews from music critics, who called it a \"morose album\" and praised Brymo's songwriting.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHarmattan & Winter was released concurrently with Brymo's eighth studio album Èsan. It comprises nine tracks and is a mixture of alternative rock, folk, sentimental ballad, and fusion rock. The album was recorded entirely in English and explores themes of monogamy, mental health, romance, despair, self-discovery, and heartbreak. Brymo dedicated Harmattan & Winter to his significant other and described it as an \"ode to every 1, to every SIGMA, woman and man, to order!\". He also said it pays homage to karma and to the seasons. On the record, Brymo's emotions are depicted in two separate ways: one side seems to wish for a calm connection, while the other side is filled with a great deal of cynicism.\nProducer Bigfoot, who oversaw Brymo's extended play Libel (2020), produced every song on Harmattan & Winter. The album's title symbolizes a transition from insufficiency to abundance. From a sonic standpoint, the album departs from Yellow's hedonistic viewpoint and Libel's subtle denial. Moreover, it produces a serene, calming musical experience in contrast to Libel's positivism and Yellow's electronic pop.\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\nThe album opens with \"F**king Awesome\", a reflective track with breathy vocals and heavy keyboards. On the record, Brymo wants his partner to be sympathetic and begs for patience and compassion while he pursues financial success. \"Harmattan & Winter\", the title track, chronicles Brymo's development as a man and an artist while detailing his path to self-actualization. Music critic Michael Kolawole said the song's instrumentation and Brymo's emotional lyrics \"provide a feeling that's hard to neglect\". In the gloomy track \"The Dark,\" Brymo reveals his vulnerability, takes full responsibility for his previous transgressions, and shows off how self-aware he is. Emmanuel Daraloye likened the song to Èsan's \"Òkùnkùn\".\nIn \"I Don't Have a Heart\", a track similar to \"Ọkán mi ti fọ́ Wẹ́wé\" from Èsan, Brymo talks about his brief depressive episode during his temporary split from his wife and his attempts to keep his marriage intact. Daraloye characterized the song as \"a middle finger to monogamy\". In the mid-tempo braggadocio track \"Beast\", Brymo portrays a lovelorn character who apologizes to his significant other for his prolonged absence and lack of emotional support. In the soulful ballad \"Winifred\", he praises his mother-in-law's generosity and tenacity. This is exemplified by lyrics like \"Give it all for Winifred, she knows, her heart is made of gold\". Daraloye called the song a \"celebration of love\" and said it \"functions as the spiritual centre-piece of the record\".\n\"Emotions and Limbs\" addresses Brymo's temporary separation from his wife Esse in a subtle manner. In the song's opening verse, the shattered feelings that caused the brief split are briefly described; in the second verse, Brymo discusses his sex life with other women and how it left him feeling hollow. The album's eighth track, \"We All Lose Sometimes\", was described by Daraloye as being \"reflective and hopeful, with a few kind words spared for sufferers of depression and anxiety\". The closing track to Harmattan & Winter, \"There's a Place\", features an epilogue that touches on themes of freedom, hope, and victory.\n\n\n== Singles ==\nThe album's lead single, \"Harmattan & Winter\", was released on September 9, 2021. The Promise Charles-directed music video for the song was released on the same day of the album's release. Kolawole praised the video's visual tics and interpretive dancing and said it \"provides a clearer picture of the song's story\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nHarmattan & Winter received positive reviews from music critics. Afrocritik writer Emmanuel Daraloye rated the album 7.2 out of 10, commending its title and Brymo's songwriting. Daraloye also said the album \"holds its own as a meaningful body of work\" and that \"empathy and hope\" are at its core. Pulse Nigeria's Motolani Alake awarded the album a rating of 7.0 out of 10, characterizing it as a \"morose album, filled with terse ideas of love and admittance of imperfection\". Conversly, Alake said the album's sonic topography was impacted by Brymo's decision to interweave love songs with pessimistic records.\nMusic critic Michael Kolawole called the album \"a compelling portrait of an artist devoted to good music\" and praised its instrumentation. Moreover, Kolawole said the singer's \"emotionally wrecking lyrics provide a feeling that's hard to neglect\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Running Water\" is a song written by Justin Hayward that was first released on the Moody Blues' 1983 album The Present. It was released as the third single from the album in the United States but did not chart.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nHayward first played a version of \"Running Water\" for producer Pip Williams during a break from the recording of The Present. Only four of the five members of the Moody Blues appear on the recording – Ray Thomas was not involved. Each band member appearing on the song recorded his part separately. Hayward plays guitar and a Casio synthesizer, John Lodge plays bass guitar, Graeme Edge plays drums, and Pat Moraz provides the synthesized string section.\n\nWilliams felt that \"Running Water\" was Hayward's best song on The Present but was disappointed that it didn't have much participation from the other band members.  He was also disappointed with the sound produced by the Casio synthesizer, saying:In retrospect, it is my feeling that the cheap Casio synth makes the track sound somewhat cold, even though I was in agreement [with using it] at the time. In fairness, Justin had composed the song on this little instrument, and it was hard to pull away from that sound when the time came to record the track properly. It's also possible that more emotional and \"warm\" feeling would have been injected had the song been performed by the whole band.\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n\"Running Water\" is a ballad that is highlighted by Hayward's \"gentle\" acoustic guitar and the synthesized orchestrations. Music journalist Geoffrey Freakes felt that the keyboard refrain sounds a little like the Moody Blues song \"The Day We Meet Again\", also written by Hayward, from the 1978 album Octave. Freakes described the music as being \"reassuringly old fashioned\" so that it \"strikes a chord with fans of a certain age.\nThe lyrics of \"Running Water\" are about time moving on. The song opens with the line \"Time hurries on/Look and it's gone\" and the chorus includes lines such as \"Oh running water/Don't throw your love away/We live to love another day.\" According to Pittsburgh Press critic Ron Weiskind, the song \"acknowledges life's inevitable changes but with a stately sadness that assures the world will go on.\" Hayward had previously explored these themes on the single \"Driftwood\" from Octave.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRolling Stone critic Errol Somay felt that \"Running Water\" was one of the songs on The Present where \"the Moody Blues are at their creative best.\" Freakes described the chorus as being \"simply gorgeous\", but felt the song may have been too subtle to be successful as a single. Allmusic critic Dave Connolly described it as a \"lush ballad\" that requires several listens to sink in. Bernardsville News critic Charles T. Zavalick described it as a pretty love song with \"lofty vocals\", but also \"a challenging song that dares to be poetically disassembled while remaining vaguely open for individual interpretation. Manchester Evening News writer Tony Jasper called it a \"gem\" and said that it is \"seen as something rivaling [the Moody Blues'] long-time classic 'Nights in White Satin.'\" San Jose Mercury News critic Andrew Slater called it \"lush and luscious, with an unobstrusive approach that is almost obtrusive after a while.\"\nThe Berkshire Eagle critic Steve Leon described \"Running Water\" and \"Driftwood\" as \"ballads that tug at the heartstrings but ooze with the sticky sweetness of a melting fudgesicle.\" Star Tribune critic Jon Bream described it as \"just another silly love song.\" Barry Leighton of the Evening Advertiser felt \"Running Water\" was an example of \"wimpy, viscous mush\" Hayward sometimes was writing.\n\n\n== Single release ==\nWilliams felt that \"Running Water\" and \"Under My Feet\" were the two songs from The Present that were most likely to become hit singles, comparing \"Running Water\" to \"Nights in White Satin.\" Although some music critics felt that \"Meet Me Halfway\" should have been the third single from the album, following \"Blue World\" and \"Sitting at the Wheel\", \"Running Water was released in the US as the third single in December 1983, with \"Under My Feet\" as the b-side. The single did not chart.\n\n\n== Live ==\n\"Running Water\" was included in the set list of the Moody Blues' live concerts during The Present tour. Lodge played it on a two-necked instrument that combined both a bass and six string guitar. Several concert reviewers, such as Tim McGraw felt that the song was one of several that slowed the concert down.  McGraw wrote in The Kansas City Star that \"Running Water\" \"turned out to be as boring in concert as...on the [album].\" Detroit Free Press critic Gary Graff said that the song \"managed to drag things down.\" Edmonton Journal reviewer Teresa Mazzitelli wrote that \"this introspective, mellow sound grew too restful and soon after, edged its way to tiresome.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Jeremiah Whitaker Newman (1759 – 27 July 1839) was an English surgeon and medical writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nNewman was the son of Arthur Newman, surgeon, of Ringwood, Hampshire. He was born in 1759, became a member of the Corporation of Surgeons, and was in practice at Ringwood in 1783. In consequence of ill-health he removed to Dover, where he made the acquaintance of Sir Thomas Mantell and his wife, and resided for many years in their house. He was a delightful companion at all times, full of anecdote and energy, intelligence and originality. On 9 Dec. 1790 he was admitted an extra-licentiate of the College of Physicians of London (Munk, Coll. of Phys. 2nd edit. ii. 414). He was a favourite with the eccentric Messenger Monsey, the resident physician at Chelsea Hospital, of whom he wrote (but did not publish) an amusing memoir. He married and settled on his own estate at Ringwood, where he died on 27 July 1839.\nHis principal work, published anonymously, was ‘The Lounger's Commonplace Book, or Miscellaneous Collections in History, Criticism, Biography, Poetry, and Romance,’ 3rd edit. 4 vols., London, 1805–7, 8vo; and 2 vols., London, 1838, 8vo. He also wrote ‘A Short Inquiry into the Merits of Solvents, so far as it may be necessary to compare them with the Operation of Lithotomy,’ London, 1781, 8vo; and ‘An Essay on the Principles and Manners of the Medical Profession; with some Occasional Remarks on the Use and Abuse of Medicines.’ These two tracts were republished in 1789 under the title of ‘Medical Essays, with Additions.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Cooper, Thompson (1894). \"Newman, Jeremiah Whitaker\".

The Geledi and Wacdaan worked together to overthrow the Silcis, another sub-clan of the Hawiye, as Somali oral history shows.\n\n\n== Overthrow of Silcis ==\nAccording to Cassanelli, “the Geledi (Rahanweyn) and Wa'dan (Darandolle Gurgate) allied to drive the Sil'is from Afgoy”.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nWacdaan primarily live in the Lower Shabelle region of Somalia. They primarily inhabit the city of Afgooye but also live in adjacent cities such as Lafoole, Jaziira, Maracade, Qoryooley.

        "content": "The Armenian Alexander Romance, known in Armenian as The History of Alexander of Macedon, is an Armenian recension (or version) of the Greek Alexander Romance (in its α recension) from the fifth-century. It incorporates many of its own elements, materials, and narratives not found in the original Greek version. While the text did not substantially influence Eastern legend, the Armenian romance is considered to be a highly important resource in reconstructing the text of the original Greek romance. The text continued to be copied until the eighteenth century, and the first Armenian and scholar to substantially study the text was Father Raphael Tʿreanc. He published an Armenian edition of it in 1842.\nIn original Greek romance, Alexander is posthumously described as \"the horned king\" (βασιλέα κερασφόρον) by an oracle instructing one of his generals, Ptolemy, on where to bury him. The Armenian version repeats this statement, making it a witness of the motif of the horns of Alexander, alongside the Syriac Alexander Legend and other versions of Alexander legends. Unlike the horns motif, no tradition of building a wall against Gog and Magog is found in the text.\nThe Armenian Romance greatly influenced the History of the Armenians of Movses Khorenatsi, with which it shares up to thirty direct parallels.\n\n\n== Manuscripts ==\nThere are at least 80 manuscripts of the Armenian Alexander Romance, of which 14 are illuminated — heavily so, with an average of 125 scenes each — although no survey has yet been able to account for the number of copies of the romance worldwide. The earliest are two from the 13th or 14th centuries (M10151 and V424), with the rest being from the 16th century onwards. In 2015, Kouymijian published a study of the iconography found in the Armenian manuscripts.\n\n\n== Dating ==\nThe translator is thought by some to have been the Armenian historian Movses of Khoren. Some scholars more argue that a date more precisely in the 480s is most probable. A dating of the fifth century is usually posited for two reasons: one is the association with Movses in some attributions, who lived in the fifth century. However, scholars most recently have tended to date the life of Movses to the 8th and 9th centuries. However, good reason to continue to date it to the fifth century is its style of translation, which is characteristic of Armenian translations that were being produced soon after the development of the Armenian alphabet around 400 by Mesrop Mashtots.\n\n\n== Other Armenian Alexander legends ==\nA second Armenian version of the Alexander Romance is also known. The first one went through various closely related versions up until the thirteenth century. However, a second version was produced sometime during the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. It became popular in an edition produced of it by Khachatur Kesaratsi between 1280 and 1310. The earliest manuscript is from the 12th century, called San Lazzaro MS 424 - Alexander romance (see [1]), and a published edition of it came out in 2001.\nWith the passage of time, Armenian manuscripts of the Alexander Romance begin to be accompanied and interpolated by original and once independent short monorhymed poems (called kafas) about Alexander legends. This began in the 13th century with the Armenian poet Xačʽatur Kečʽaṙecʽi, who added more than 150 short poems to the manuscript he produced, and it went on until the 16th century, primarily with Katʽołikos Grigoris Ałtʽamarcʽi and his pupil Zakʽaria Gnunecʽi. These poems depict how the Armenian romance was understood, and on occasion offer direct interpretations. The poems began to find their way into manuscripts of other texts as well. For example, a 17th-century manuscript M7709 of the Armenian History of the City of Brass is accompanied by a few Alexander poems by an unknown scribe.\n\n\n== Editions and translations ==\nIn 1969, a translation of the Armenian recension into English was published by Albert Mugrdich Wolohojian.\nA critical edition of the Armenian text is available in: H. Simonyan, Patmowt’iwn Alek’sandri Makedonac ’woy, haykakan xmbagrowt'iwnner [Storia di Alessandro il Macedone, redazioni armene], Erevan 1989.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlexander the Great in legend\nQissat al-Iskandar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEnglish translation of the Armenian Alexander Romance\nVirtual interaction with an illustrated Armenian manuscript, Armenian MS 3\nManuscript ms 5472 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art",

        "content": "Love Having You Around: Live at the Keystone Korner Vol. 2 is a live album by jazz vocalist Abbey Lincoln. It was recorded during March 1980 at the Keystone Korner in San Francisco, California, and was released in 2016 by HighNote Records. On the album, Lincoln is joined by pianist Phil Wright, double bassists James Leary and Art Washington, and drummer Doug Sides.\nAnother recording from the same engagement, titled Sophisticated Abbey: Live at the Keystone Korner, was released by HighNote in 2015.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for Jazzwise, Peter Quinn praised the rendition of \"Driva Man\", originally recorded in 1960 for the Max Roach album We Insist!, \"here stripped down to just voice and percussion with Sides' relentless snare hit symbolising the crack of the whip,\" and described \"Little Girl Blue\" as \"heartbreakingly tender.\"\nAnders Griffen of The New York City Jazz Record wrote: \"These March 1980 sets from The Keystone Korner\nare a treasure. This was during something of a musical resurgence as the '70s consisted of more acting as well as teaching and study. In 1980 the powerful Lincoln returns, at once more refined and more versatile.\"\nDusted Magazine's Derek Taylor noted that, at the time of the recording, Lincoln's \"early career milestone as a civil rights crucible in jazz had... given way to a broader mantle as a member of the idiom's songstress royalty and the program reflects the shift in repertoire.\" He expressed admiration for her \"engaged and amiable\" demeanor, her \"skill at negotiating an elaborate lyric,\" and her \"earthy inflections.\"\nWriting for Jazz Weekly, George W. Harris stated that the album finds Lincoln \"in vintage form,\" and described her sidemen as \"both flexible and in the pocket, just right for this kind of vocalist who can take you to the church hall or street corner in seconds flat.\" He commented: \"Her rich voice swings with Ted Williams' fluidity... and her vibrato is gorgeously supple... The sound quality is acceptable; the music quality is essential.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Talkin' to the Sun\" (Abbey Lincoln) – 4:55\n\"Love Having You Around\" (Stevie Wonder) – 6:34\n\"When Malindy Sings\" (Oscar Brown, Jr., Paul Laurence Dunbar) – 8:03\n\"Little Girl Blue\" (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) – 4:34\n\"Driva Man\" (Max Roach, Oscar Brown, Jr.) – 2:25\n\"Living Room\" (Max Roach, Abbey Lincoln) – 5:04\n\"Rainbow\" (Melba Liston, Abbey Lincoln) – 4:35\n\"Throw It Away\" (Abbey Lincoln) – 7:56\n\"Africa\" (John Coltrane, Abbey Lincoln) – 7:50\n\"Closing Remarks\" – 1:59\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAbbey Lincoln – vocals\nPhil Wright – piano\nJames Leary – double bass (tracks: 1–8, 10)\nArt Washington – double bass (track 9)\nDoug Sides – drums\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Cumberland Medical Center is a 72-bed, secondary care general hospital located in Crossville, Tennessee.  It is part of Covenant Health, and has been so since joining the eastern Tennessee-based healthcare system in 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nCumberland County's first medical facility opened in 1921, when Dr. May Cravath Wharton began operating a two-bed clinic in Pleasant Hill, Tennessee.  The following year, Uplands Cumberland Mountain Sanitorium was established as a 30-bed general hospital in Pleasant Hill and grew several times during the mid- to late 1930s.  However, as the medical needs of the community outpaced the capabilities of Cumberland General, plans for a new regional health center began to form.  Though delayed several years by World War II, ground broke on Cumberland Medical Center on November 5, 1948 in Crossville, Tennessee.  Construction would go on for approximately one and a half years.  Cumberland Medical Center officially admitted its first patient on March 19, 1950 at midnight.  The dedication ceremony that day included several speakers, including Senator Albert Gore.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nCumberland Medical Center opened with only two wings, \"A\" and \"B,\" consisting of two operating rooms, a small medical laboratory, and x-ray department.  In 1960, a \"C\" wing was added, giving some 17 additional patient beds. In 1969, the hospital underwent another expansion, increasing bed space to a total of 127 and adding an emergency department.  Yet more expansions in 1973 and then in 1977 increased total bed capacity to 159 and 216, respectively.",

        "content": "The UK Country Airplay chart is a weekly music chart based on the radio airplay of country music singles on radio stations in the United Kingdom. It serves as the UK equivalent to the American Billboard Country Airplay chart. \nAnnounced on 8 March 2024, the debut chart was revealed a few days later on 10 March to coincide with the final day of the 2024 C2C: Country to Country music festival, with the official top 20 being posted each week on the UK-based country publication Holler. The chart, which is the first genre-specific radio chart in the UK, aims to serve as a key measure of which songs are being enjoyed most frequently by listeners across the country and is produced in collaboration with music company Radiomonitor, and the UK branch of the Country Music Association.\nThe first number-one song on the UK Country Airplay chart was \"Creek Will Rise\" by Conner Smith. The current number one single is \"Tucson Too Late\" by Jordan Davis.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe creation of the chart was spearheaded by the increase in popularity of country music within the UK and was described by Milly Olykan, vice president of international relations and development for the CMA, as a “pivotal initiative in a move towards more mainstream moments for the genre” and noting how the consumption of country music in the UK increased by 40% in 2023. In a statement following the announcement of the chart, Olkyan explained  “This is an incredibly exciting time for country music in the UK. From the genre experiencing a 40% growth in consumption throughout the last year, to the volume of tickets sold to Country festivals and tours increasing at a record pace, it's apparent the Country is broadening significantly into the mainstream in the UK. This new radio chart will provide another exposure opportunity to further elevate Country artists and allow for greater engagement with fans. As the premier trade association supporting the growth of the Country Music industry, CMA's focus in the UK is to continue to identify how we can move towards more mainstream moments for the genre, and this is another pivotal initiative.” \nAlexa Hannaby, head of Big Machine Records in the UK and leader of the project, stated \"I'm thrilled for the launch of the UK Country Radio Airplay Chart, a significant milestone for Country music in the UK. This achievement is truly a testament to the incredible teamwork and collaboration between industry experts and Radiomonitor. Together, we're paving the way for increased recognition and exposure for country artists in the UK and I'm excited to see its impact unfold.\n\n\n=== First top 10 ===\nThe first ever top 10 was revealed on 10 March 2024:\n\n\"Creek Will Rise\" – Conner Smith\n\"The Painter\" – Cody Johnson\n\"Pretty Little Poison\" – Warren Zeiders\n\"Tucson Too Late\" – Jordan Davis\n\"Your Place\" – Ashley Cooke\n\"I Can Feel It\" – Kane Brown\n\"Burn It Down\" – Parker McCollum\n\"Wildflowers and Wild Horses\" – Lainey Wilson\n\"Where It Ends\" – Bailey Zimmerman\n\"23\" – Chayce Beckham\n\n\n== Eligibility ==\nEach weekly iteration of the chart will consist of the Top 20 songs being heard on the radio, taken from a pool of new releases, with anything that was made available more than three years ago discounted. This will help to ensure the chart is an accurate reflection of current trends and interests within the genre. Data is compiled from a plethora of UK country radio stations, including Absolute Radio Country, BBC Radio 2 - The Country Show with Bob Harris, CountryLine: The Big 615, Downtown Country Radio, and Smooth Country Radio.\n\n\n== Number ones ==\n\n\n== Most weeks at number one ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The twelve songs on the album were recorded in two days, supported by bassist Eric Vogel and Grammy-winning drummer Terence Higgins.\nJohanson's manager suggested Jesse Dayton to produce the album. Dayton had him play each track live about five times to figure out what worked and what didn't work.  By the time the musicians recorded the tracks live in the studio, Johanson had the live experience of working with Dayton to draw upon, allowing him to dial in on the sound he wanted.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Fuxue Confucian Temple of Jinan is located in the Lixia District of the Jinan Prefecture, Shandong Province, China, south of Daming Lake and near old city streets such as Furong Street. It was first built during the Xining period of the Northern Song Dynasty (1068–1077) and rebuilt in the second year of the Ming Hongwu era (1369). By the time of the Republic of China, it had been expanded and rebuilt more than thirty times. The architectural complex faces north and sits south, with a strict layout and grand scale. Major buildings include the Dacheng Gate, Lingxing Gate, Pan Reservoir, Dacheng Hall, Minglun Hall, and Zunjing Pavilion.\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Confucius Temple was occupied by primary schools, factories, and others, leading to the destruction of many buildings. In 1992, it became a protected cultural site of Shandong Province, and in 2005, major renovations began. Surviving ancient buildings were restored, and demolished parts were reconstructed. After restoration, the Confucius Temple regained its function for Confucian worship and became a core part of Jinan's historical and cultural protection area.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Confucius Temple is located in the western part of the old city of Jinan, south of Daming Lake. The current protected area of the Confucius Temple, while slightly smaller than its heyday, roughly extends from the south of Minghu Road to the north of the Confucius Temple's shadow wall, from the west of Xihuazhengzi Street, Fuxue West Court Street, and Fuxue West Pavilion Street to the east of Xiangmen Lane and Donghuazhengzi Street. The surrounding streets are mostly named after the Confucius Temple, such as Dong and Xi Huazhengzi Streets, named after the brick patterns used on the temple walls (commonly known as Huazhengzi), and the short street on the north side of the Donghuazhengzi Street is called \"Xiangmen Lane\" because it is located next to the east gate of the temple, and the short street on the east side of Xiangmen Lane is called Panbi Street because it is located outside the east wall of the temple.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Fuxue Confucius Temple of Jinan was established during the Xining period of the Northern Song dynasty (1068–1077) following the regulations of the Confucius Temple in Qufu, Shandong Province, and is one of the earliest Temples of Confucius. During the Jin period (1213–1216), the temple was destroyed by war and became even more dilapidated by the end of the Yuan Dynasty. It was rebuilt in the second year of the Ming Hongwu era (1369). In the tenth year of the Chenghua era (1474), the magistrate Cai Sheng added two pavilions and built Fangshu Screens. In the thirteenth year of the Chenghua era (1477), the censor Liang Ze expanded the main hall and two pavilions, and built Jimen, Lingxing Gate, and Minglun Hall. It was repaired several times afterward. Although it underwent repairs during the Qing Dynasty, the basic layout remained unchanged.\n\nIn 1946, the Second Experimental Primary School of Shandong Province was established, using the Confucius Temple as its campus. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, it was renamed Furong Street Primary School. In 1964, the school demolished buildings such as Minglun Hall and built a three-story office and teaching building, relocating the school gate to No. 248 Daming Lake Road. In 1965, the school was officially renamed Daming Lake Road Primary School.\nIn February 2003, during the first session of the 11th Jinan Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) , Cui Dayong, Deputy Director of the Municipal Bureau of Culture, submitted a proposal entitled \"Proposal to Relocate Daming Lake Road Primary School and Other Units for the Restoration of Fuxue Confucian Temple of Jinan\" to the conference. In September of the same year, nine employees of the Shandong Provincial Museum of Culture and History, including Cai Fengshu and Han Mingxiang, jointly wrote a letter to provincial leaders suggesting the restoration of the Temple. In 2004, relevant departments of Jining City began to formulate restoration plans. On September 10, 2005, the \"Millennium Restoration\" project of Confucian Temple finally commenced, restoring the remaining buildings such as the Dacheng Hall, Pan Reservoir, Dacheng Gate, screen walls, and dressing rooms, and rebuilding other structures. In October 2006, the restoration of the Dacheng Hall was basically completed. On June 9, 2007, the buildings south of the Dacheng Hall were basically completed and opened to the public for one day. By the end of 2007, with the relocation of Daming Lake Road Primary School completed, the demolition of the original teaching building north of the Dacheng Hall and the reconstruction of the temple buildings officially began. In February 2009, the construction of the Zunjing Pavilion's wooden structure was completed.\nAccording to long-term vision planning, reconstruction of ancient buildings such as Qisheng Temple, Jiaoxiao Temple, Wenchang Temple, Xueshu, Kuixing Tower, and Shepu will also be carried out north of the Confucian Temple; while south of the Confucian Temple, the original streets and lanes will be preserved to restore the old cultural atmosphere. After the demolition of buildings on the west side of the Confucian Temple, Minghuan Temple and Xiangxian Temple will also be rebuilt, forming a westward layout parallel to the main axis of the Confucian Temple.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\n=== Organization ===\nAccording to historical records, the scale of this Confucian Temple is large, with a length of 247 meters and a maximum width of 66 meters. The architectural complex is built around the north-south central axis, with the following buildings along the central axis: screen walls, Dacheng Gate, Lingxing Gate, Pan Reservoir and stone arched bridge, Ping Gate, Ji Gate, Dacheng Hall, Minglun Hall, Huanbi Pavilion, and Zunjing Pavilion.\nThe screen wall is located south of the temple gate, forming a character \"一\". Upon entering the temple gate and heading north, there is Lingxing Gate, flanked by square and round pavilions named \"Zhongju\" and \"Zhonggui\" respectively. Further north is the semi-circular Pan Reservoir with a stone arched bridge spanning its center. Beyond that is the Ping Gate, with \"Zhongying\" and \"Yuxiu\" two pavilions on the east and west sides respectively, and dressing rooms on the east and sacrificial rooms on the west.\nProceeding north is the Ji Gate. Near the eastern wall of the Ji Gate, there is a water pool, and within the pool stands the Fan Jump Pavilion, named \"Feiyue Pavilion\". Entering the Ji Gate leads to the core building of the Confucian Temple, the Dacheng Hall, flanked by east and west wing halls, forming a closed courtyard. The Dacheng Hall is built on a raised platform, with Imperial Tablet Pavilions on the east and west sides. North of the Dacheng Hall is the Minglun Hall, with two pavilions on each side: Zhidao Hall, Jude Hall, Yiren Hall, and Youyi Hall respectively. Further north is the Zunjing Pavilion, with a water pool in front, and within the pool stands a pavilion named \"Huanbi Pavilion\". To the east of the Zunjing Pavilion is the Shepu Hall, and to the north are the residences of the instructors and the gate of the Confucian school.\nThe water of the Pan Reservoir in the Confucian Temple is connected to the water system of Jinan City. The water of Daming Lake flows into the Confucian Temple from the northeast, passes through the water pool of the Fan Jump Pavilion into the Pan Reservoir, then flows out of the Pan Reservoir to the northwest outside the west corridor, around to the water pool in front of the Zunjing Pavilion, then flows eastward and is named \"Yudai River\". West of the Yudai River, there are buildings such as the Wenchang Pavilion.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n\n==== Dacheng Hall ====\n\nThe Dacheng Hall of the Jinan Confucian Temple is the largest single ancient building in Jinan City, and one of the largest single-eaved pavilion-roofed ancient buildings still existing in Shandong Province. Its scale ranks third among Dacheng Halls of Confucian temples across China. The hall is nine bays wide, with a width of 34.5 meters from east to west; four bays deep, with a depth of 13.9 meters from north to south; and a height of 13.86 meters, covering an area of approximately 480 square meters. The single-eaved pavilion roof is covered with yellow glazed tile, and the wooden structure follows the lifting beam style, with columns featuring distinct base, corner, and rising parts, retaining the characteristics of Song Dynasty architecture. Dougong are decorated with colorful paintings. Inside the hall, a method of reducing columns is used, with different heights for the ceilings, lower for the central and secondary bays, and higher for the end bays. The east, west, and north sides of the hall are surrounded by eaves walls, and the front eaves on the south side each have a six-panel diamond-patterned screen door, while the end bays have diamond-patterned windows.\n\nIn the center of the hall are statues of Confucius and the Four Sages, with several plaques inscribed by Qing emperors hanging from the ceiling, all destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. In 2005, a fragmentary plaque inscribed by Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty with the characters \"生民未有\" was accidentally discovered. In September 2009, a new statue of Confucius, 2.72 meters tall, was officially completed, and later the Four Sages and twelve sages were reinstalled, with statues of Confucius' disciples placed in the east and west corridors on the south side of the Dacheng Hall.\nThe Dacheng Hall was originally situated on a spacious terrace. With the passage of time, the building has deteriorated, the ridge beasts were smashed during the Cultural Revolution, and the foundation of the hall is now level with the ground, lacking its former grandeur. During the reconstruction, engineers employed the method of \"dismantling and raising\", which involved completely dismantling the main hall, carefully marking its components, raising the foundation, and then attempting to reuse the original materials as much as possible in the reconstruction. After reconstruction, the Dacheng Hall has been raised by 1.5 meters, restoring its former lofty height.\nOriginally, there were two imperial stele pavilions in front of the Dacheng Hall, one on each side, hexagonal in shape with yellow glazed tile roofs, built during the Kangxi period. The sites and remnants of these pavilions still exist, and some inscribed steles have been preserved. During the construction of the Dacheng Hall, two stone steles were unearthed in front of the hall.\n\n\n==== Other buildings ====\n\n\n== Inscriptions and stone carvings ==\nIn the 1950s, there were still 27 Ming and Qing stone steles preserved in the Confucian Temple, including seven plaques in the Dacheng Hall, one plaque in the Minglun Hall, and several other stone carvings. During the Cultural Revolution, most of these cultural relics were destroyed. By the time of the survey in 1982, only a few survived, including the \"Reconstruction of the Steles of the Confucian Temple of Jinan\" from the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty and the \"Prohibition of Teaching and Guidance for Jinan Fuxue Professors and Tutors\" from the Daoguang period.\nIn addition, in 1991, during the repair of buildings at Daming Lake Road Primary School, an important stone carving was unearthed, namely the \"Portrait of the Venerated Sage\" stele. This stele was originally erected near the Dacheng Hall. The inscription in seal script on the stele reads \"Portrait of the Venerated Sage,\" and it is recorded that \"Wu Weiyue imitated the brushwork of Wu Daozi to depict the image of the Venerated Sage.\" In the center, there is an intaglio carving of Confucius teaching, and on the lower right side, there is an inscription in clerical script stating \"Brushwork of Wu Daozi.\" This stele is currently housed in the Jinan Museum.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTemple of Confucius, Qufu\nConfucius\n\n\n== References ==",

The historic stone house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 9, 1983, for its significance in architecture. It was listed as part of the Early Stone Houses of Bergen County Multiple Property Submission (MPS).\nAccording to the nomination form, the house was built between 1760 and 1803 by Jacob Ackerman. In 1803, it was purchased by Henry P. Hopper, who had married Elizabeth Ackerman. His son, Peter H.

        "content": "Edwin Lee (died 8 June 1870) was an English medical writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLee was entered the profession as an articled pupil of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. He became a student at St. George's Hospital in 1824, and during his apprenticeship attended the medical schools of Paris. In 1829 he was elected member of the College of Surgeons, and soon afterwards was appointed house-surgeon to St. George's Hospital, an office which he resigned before 1833. Subsequently, he competed for the house-surgeoncy of the Birmingham Hospital, but was defeated by one vote. He then passed some time on the continent attending medical institutions and investigating points of practice which at that time were not much known in England. Among these subjects was lithotrity, upon which he gave public demonstrations in London and some of the larger provincial towns. For his dissertation upon the advantages of this method of operating as compared with lithotomy the College of Surgeons in 1838 awarded him the Jacksonian prize. In 1844 he became a candidate for the assistant-surgeoncy to St. George's Hospital, but withdrew in consequence, as he alleged, of the gross unfairness of the proceedings. Upon the occasion of another vacancy, in 1848, he refused to stand; but protested against the system of election by advertisements in the 'Times' and 'Morning Chronicle,' and by a pamphlet addressed to the governors of the hospital. The College of Surgeons declined to admit him to the fellowship, whereupon he attacked Sir Benjamin Brodie and the governing body. Failing to obtain settled practice he divided his time between London, which he generally visited during the season, and one or other watering-place in England or on the continent. Latterly he resided much abroad. By 1846 Lee had received the M.D. degree of Göttingen. He was subsequently elected member of various foreign medical associations, including those of Paris, Berlin, and Naples, and was for some years fellow of the Royal Medico-Chirurgical Society of London. He died on 8 June 1870.\nLee was a man of great industry. He was best known by his handbooks to continental health resorts. His earliest work on the subject was ‘An Account of the most frequented Watering Places on the Continent … and of the Medicinal Application of their Mineral Springs; with … an Appendix on English Mineral Waters,’ 8vo, London, 1836. ‘Additional Remarks on the Use of English Mineral Springs’ followed in 1837, and ‘Practical Observations on Mineral Waters and Baths’ in 1846. Similar information Lee published under a variety of titles. ‘The Baths of Nassau, Baden, and the Adjacent Districts. First Part. Thermal Springs,’ was issued in 1839, and the portion treating of Nassau reappeared in 1863 (5th edit. 1869). ‘The Principal Baths of Germany,’ 2 vols. 8vo, is dated 1840–1. Rhenish Germany was similarly treated in 1850 (5th edit. 1870); Homburg in 1853 (new edit. 1861); France, Germany, and Switzerland collectively (3rd edit. 1854, another 3rd edit. 1857 in 2 vols., 4th edit. 1863); Vichy in 1862; Switzerland and Savoy in 1865, and collectively with France in 1867; the Engadine (St. Moritz and St. Tarasp) in 1869; Baden and Würtemberg (1 vol.), Spa (1 vol.), France (1 vol.), and Rhenish Prussia (1 vol.), in 1870. A work by Lee on English mineral springs (1841) was reissued as ‘The Baths and Watering Places of England’ in 1848, and was followed by books on Brighton (1850), on the Undercliff and Bournemouth (1856), and on the southern watering-places—Hastings, St. Leonards, Dover, and Tunbridge Wells (1856). He translated a French account of Nice (1854); wrote of Hyères and Cannes (1857 in French, translated 1867); of Mentone (1861); and of the health resorts of southern France collectively (1860, 1865, 1868). He won also several valuable prizes, including the town committee prize for an essay on ‘Cheltenham and its Resources’ (printed in 1851); the Fiske fund prize (United States) for a dissertation on ‘The Effect of Climate on Tuberculous Disease’ (published in 1858, and reissued with additions in 1867); that awarded by the Milan Society for the encouragement of arts and sciences, for an essay on ‘Le Magnétisme Animal: ses applications à la Physiologie et à la Thérapeutique’ (issued in English and in a greatly enlarged form in 1866); and another essay-prize given by the Toulouse medical society about 1860 on ‘Des Paralysies sans lésion organique appréciable,’ an English translation of which appeared in 1866.\nLee's writings (exclusive of memoirs contributed to medical journals and ephemeral pamphlets on the position of his profession) are, besides those mentioned: \n\n‘A Treatise on some Nervous Disorders,’ 8vo, London, 1833; 2nd edit. 1838.\n‘Observations on the Principal Medical Institutions and Practice of France, Italy, and Germany; with … an Appendix on Animal Magnetism and Homœopathy,’ 8vo, London, 1835; 2nd edit. 1843.

Seattle Fish Guys has garnered a positive reception, especially for its poke, and is considered among the city's best seafood establishments.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSeattle Fish Guys is a \"gleaming, upscale\" fish market and restaurant in Seattle's Central District, according to The Seattle Times. The business operates in the \"nondescript\" Verse Seattle building at the intersection of 23rd and Jackson. It has sold bivalves (including mussels), clam chowder, crab and shrimp cocktails, fish, poke, and smoked lox. Ingredients in bowls include kimchi, macaroni salad, octopus, brown or white rice, salmon, seaweed salad, and tuna. The crab rolls (or Dungeness crab \"subs\") have Japanese mayonnaise, Sriracha, and scallions on a toasted bun. The restaurant's aioli has garlic.\nSeattle Fish Guys also stocks flowers and spice rubs, and has created take-home meal kits for special occasions; one for Lunar New Year included steamed black cod with black bean sauce and mochi donuts.\n\n\n== History ==\nCo-owners Desiree Chinn and Sal Panelo opened Seattle Fish Guys in 2016. The restaurant's grand opening celebration was held on September 4, and featured free samples and a mussel eating contest.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe magazine Seattle Metropolitan says of Seattle Fish Guys: \"One of the Central District's favorite destinations for a convivial lunch is also an after-work godsend for picking up dinner.\" Aimee Rizzo of The Infatuation said of the poke in 2020, \"Between the soy-marinated tuna, spicy salmon, furikake rice, and smoky macaroni salad, this is a bowl that's better than the sum of its parts—even though each part is excellent.\" She and Kayla Sager-Riley included Seattle Fish Guys in a 2023 overview of the city's best poke and a 2024 overview of the city's best seafood. In 2023, the South Seattle Emerald said the shop was among chef J. Kenji López-Alt's favorite South End eateries.\nAlyssa Therrien included the business in the Daily Hive's 2021 list of Seattle's \"most poppin'\" poke establishments, and Megan Hill included Seattle Fish Guys in Eater Seattle's 2022 overview of fifteen \"great places\" to eat in the Central District. Noms Magazine ranked the business eighth in a 2023 list of Seattle's thirteen best seafood restaurants, and recommended the crab sub, the idako (marinated baby octopus), and the poke bowl. Allecia Vermillion included the restaurant in Seattle Metropolitan's 2024 overview of the city's best seafood.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nJack's Fish Spot\nList of seafood restaurants\nPike Place Fish Market\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

        "content": "Edion Peace Wing Hiroshima (エディオンピースウイング広島) is a football stadium in Hiroshima, Japan, which has a seating capacity of 28,520. It has been the home of Sanfrecce Hiroshima and Sanfrecce Hiroshima Regina since 2024.\n\n\n== History ==\nSanfrecce Hiroshima had played their home games at the multi-purpose Hiroshima Big Arch stadium since 1992, but there had been ideas for a new, football-specific stadium to be built since the early 2000s. In February 2003, Mayor Tadatoshi Akiba promised that a stadium would be built, however nothing initially came to fruition.Following the success of the football team in the early 2010s, winning the 2012, 2013 and 2014 J1 League titles, plans to build a new stadium were once again brought to the fore. In August 2012, Sanfrecce Hiroshima and their supporters association submitted a request to Hiroshima Prefecture and Hiroshima City for the construction of a new stadium. This was followed in January 2013 by approximately 370,000 people signing a petition supporting the cause.In September 2013, a list of nine potential locations for a new stadium was drawn up by the review committee.\nCentral Park Freedom/Lawn Square (Naka Ward)\nFormer Hiroshima Municipal Stadium site (Naka Ward)\nHiroshima Minato Park (Minami Ward)\nDejima Higashi No. 2 open storage area (Minami Ward)\nPrefectural Hiroshima Nishi Air Base site (Nishi Ward)\nPrefectural General Ground (Nishi Ward)\nHiroshima Regional Park (Asaminami Ward)\nItsukaichi Landfill (Saeki Ward)\nPresentation of site for exchange facilities such as trade fairs and conventions (Minami Ward)In March 2016, Sanfrecce Hiroshima announced its own plan to build a stadium on the Hiroshima Municipal Stadium site, but Hiroshima City and the club agreed to reconsider later in the year. In February 2019, it was decided that the stadium would be built in the central park, within walking distance of the A-Bomb Dome and adjacent to Hiroshima Castle.\n\nIn March 2021, a consortium of eight entities led by Taisei Corporation was selected as the contractors and work got underway in February 2022. The site was officially opened on 1 February 2024 with a small ceremony at the stadium. The construction cost is estimated at ¥27.1 billion.\nThe inaugural game was a club friendly between Sanfrecce Hiroshima and Gamba Osaka on 10 February 2024, which the home team lost 1–2. The first league game was played on 23 February 2024 against Urawa Red Diamonds, with the hosts winning 2–0 and Yuki Ohashi scoring the first goal in the new stadium.\n\n\n== Structure and facilities ==\nEdion Peace Wing Hiroshima has a site area of approximately 49,900 square metres, with the stadium itself having a capacity of 28,520. The building is approximately 42 metres high and is constructed of steel reinforced concrete and some steel frame construction. The stadium has a football-specific layout, with only about 8 metres separating the pitch and stands. For comparison, Sanfrecce's previous stadium's pitch was 30 to 40 metres away. \nThe stadium's white saddle roof arches high over the south stand and slopes down to the north stand opposite. With indentations in the corners on the south side and a pronounced depression in the north part, inspired by the \"wings of hope\" that symbolises Hiroshima.\n\n\n=== Stands ===\nThere are four stands in the north, south, east, and west, each with a different design, that surround the pitch on all sides. Along the sides, the stands consist of two tiers, with a narrow tier in-between. A tall, single-tier stand is located behind the south goal and is dedicated to the home fans, with a capacity of 6,200. The north stand, which has municipal housing in the background, is for visitors and has a limited capacity of 2,200 in consideration of noise. The seats are irregularly arranged in colours of ultramarine, blue, and grey. They were provided by manufacturer Iris Ohyama.\nA large 9 by 32 metre screen is installed on the north stand, which is the same size as the Japan National Stadium. The south side has a clock and timing device measuring 9 by 16 metres. There is also a 380 metre long belt shaped screen in front of the fourth-floor seating around the stadium.\n\n\n=== Pitch ===\nThe entire field is 121 by 84 metres, with a natural grass area of 110 by 71 metres. The pitch itself measures 105 by 68 metres and is located on a north–south axis.\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\nThe venue has VIP boxes, business seats, catering facilities as well as a museum, restaurants and shops to attract visitors outside of match days. The area to the east of the stadium is to be equipped with green spaces, trees and fountains. It retains its recreational function and is accessible to all residents. The project also includes the construction of pedestrian bridges over the adjacent streets and the creation of a small marina on the nearby arm of the Ōta River.\nAdditionally, there is an 8 by 2 metre mural called 'Peace Wall', drawn by Yoichi Takahashi, the original author of Captain Tsubasa.\n\n\n== Naming rights ==\nThe name of the stadium according to the ordinance is Hiroshima Soccer Stadium. In order to secure funding, the naming rights were put out to tender in March 2020 for companies that have a head office, branch office, or equivalent business office in Hiroshima prefecture. Electronics retailer EDION Corporation acquired the naming rights for a fee of ¥100 million per year. The agreement runs for 10 years, starting on 1 February 2024 and ending on 31 January 2034.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Train ===\nApproximately 15 minutes walk from Shin-Hakushima Station, approximately 20 minutes walk from Yokogawa Station, and approximately 30 minutes walk from Hiroshima Station, all on the JR West Sanyo Main Line (Hiroshima Station also being a stop for the Sanyo Shinkansen Line).\nApproximately 10 minutes walk from Kenchō-mae Station on the Hiroshima Rapid Transit Astram Line, approximately 15 minutes walk from Shin-Hakushima Station.\n10 minutes walk from Hiroshima Electric Railway Genbaku Dome-mae Station tram stop, 10 minutes walk from Kamiya-cho-nishi Station tram stop.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nApproximately 10 minutes walk from Hiroshima Bus Center\n\n\n=== Car ===\nApproximately 20 minutes from San'yō Expressway Hiroshima Interchange\n\n\n== See also ==\nLists of stadiums\nList of football stadiums in Japan\nList of stadiums in Japan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEdion Peace Wing Hiroshima website",

        "content": "The Oratorio di San Quirino is a Baroque style, former-Roman Catholic oratory, that is a small church or chapel, located at Strada agli \nOspizi Civili, alongside the east bank of the Parma river,  in central Parma, Italy. The oratory has been deconsecrated and is now used for cultural events and concerts.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe oratory was initially founded in 1331 by Garfuccio de' Garfi, and known as the oratory of Sant'Angelo dai frati Carmelitani, since it was affiliated to the Carmelite monks at the nearby monastery and church of Santa Maria del Carmine, which is also deconsecrated. The dedication was changed in 1335 to Saint Quirinus. The fraternity associated with the oratory commissioned the reconstruction in the present style in 1734 with designs by Edelberto dalla Nave. By the 19th century, the oratory had fallen in disuse, and in 1903 was deconsecrated. The interior, while in many spots bare, still has frescoes by Giovanni Bolla in the interior. Stucco statuary by Pietro Reti adorn the interior niches. The altars include works by Clemente Ruta (Birth of the Virgin) and Pietro Rubini.\n\n\n== References ==",

He entered the priesthood under Ryoji at Uriren Jofukuji Temple and studied under Rensho at Ota Honen-ji Temple in the same province. He studied a wide range of Buddhism, primarily Pure Land Buddhism, but also Tendai, Esoteric Buddhism, Zen, and Kusha. He established rituals for transmission of the Dharma for the training of Jōdo-sect followers, formally establishing Jōdo-shū as an independent sect from Tendai. He was also well-versed in Shinto, Confucianism, and Japanese poetry.\nHis disciples included Seisō and Ryōchi, and together with Seisō, who became the eighth patriarch of the sect, he is regarded as the leader who promoted the Jōdo sect's Chinzeigyō from a doctrinal and academic perspective. He is also known for founding the Edo Koishikawa Denzu-in Temple.\n\n\n== References ==",

Benjamin Franklin received a letter from Leith on how to make Parmesan cheese.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLeith second son of John Forbes Leith and Jean Morrison, was born in 1746 in Aberdeenshire. He studied medicine in the university of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. 12 September 1768. His thesis was read 31 August 1768, and was published at the University Press. It is on the delirium of fever, is dedicated to William Cullen and John Gregory, his instructors, and shows some subtlety of distinction and of argument. He practised at Greenwich, and was elected F.R.S. in 1781, and 26 June 1786 licentiate of the College of Physicians of London. In 1806, on the death of his elder brother, he inherited Whitehaugh, Aberdeenshire, went to reside there, and there he died, after breaking his clavicle, 6 September 1819. He married Marie d'Arboine in 1776, and had six children.\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1893). \"Leith, Theodore Forbes\".

        "content": "The Pančevo executions (Serbo-Croatian Latin: Pokolj u Pančevu; Serbian Cyrillic: Пoкoлј у Панчеву) were the summary execution of 36 Serb civilians in Pančevo from 21 to 22 April 1941, during World War II. The executions were carried out by the German army, in particular elements of the Panzergrenadier Division Großdeutschland, with the assistance of the Waffen SS, in particular elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich. The executions were also supported and facilitated by local Germans, in particular members of the Kulturbund. The executions came about in response to an alleged ambush by local Serbs on elements of the German army. In reality, the ambush was a false-flag operation, orchestrated by the local Germans.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPančevo is a town on the banks of the Danube, approximately 17 kilometres (11 mi) north east of Belgrade. It had an ethnically mixed population of Serbs and Germans throughout much of its history. Relations between the two ethnic groups was cordial, however when Nazi Germany invaded Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, relations deteriorated significantly after members of the Kulturbund, a German fascist political organization, acted as a fifth column for invading German forces. During the day on 20 April 1941, the Kulturbund ambushed a column of refugees and Yugoslav army personnel fleeing from Banatsko Novo Selo. The ambush resulted in fifteen individuals being shot. In retaliation, the Yugoslav army shot nine local Germans.On the evening of 20 April 1941, German forces entered Pančevo and were ambushed by unknown assailants operating from the Serbian cemetery. The German army searched the cemetery and found nothing. The ambush had in fact been a false flag operation, carried out by local Germans.\n\n\n=== Executions ===\nOn the morning of 21 April 1941, the German army and Waffen-SS arrested 100 men from various parts of Pančevo as a result of the previous nights ambush. Of the 100, 40 were selected to appear before a military tribunal, which was conducted by the town commander, Lt. Col. Fritz Bandelow of the Panzergrenadier Division Großdeutschland. Following the tribunal, 36 Serbs were sentenced to death by the presiding judge, SS-Sturmbannführer Rudolf Hoffmann. The executions were carried out by members of the German army, with assistance from the Kulturbund and Waffen-SS. Half were executed by hanging while the other half were executed by firing squad. The dead bodies were put on public display for three days following the executions.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nPančevo was liberated by Allied forced as part of the Belgrade offensive in 1944. In January 1945, the remains of the 36 Serb civilians executed was discovered in a mass grave. Forensic evidence noted that the Germans had unearthed the grave and burnt the bones of the victims in an attempt to remove any trace of the execution, prior to their withdrawal.\n\n\n=== Photos ===\nThe executions were extensively photographed by the German war photographer, Gerhard Gronefield for the magazine, Signal. In total, fifty images were taken, however Gronefield did not submit the photographs to Signal. It was not until 1963 that some of the photos were published in a book, however it did not elicit any public outcry. The photographs were later exhibited as part of an exhibition titled The war of annihilation. The German news magazine Der Spiegel used the photographs as part of a lead article on War crimes of the Wehrmacht. The article prompted eyewitnesses to the executions to come forward, with many more photos being submitted and circulated.

        "earliest_creation_date": "2007-12-19 17:31:05",
        "content": "Długosz House is a historic building in Kraków's Old Town, located at 25 Kanonicza Street, at the corner with Podzamcze Street, at the foot of Wawel hill. Erected in the 14th century, it housed a royal bathhouse. It was repeatedly rebuilt and transformed. Since the first half of the 15th century, it served as a residential house for cathedral canons, and it owes its name to one of them – Jan Długosz. It was not until the 19th century that its purpose changed, and during this century, Stanisław Wyspiański lived there. Currently, it serves as the seat of the rectorate of the Pontifical University of John Paul II.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Royal bathhouse ===\nThe masonry building, which constitutes the oldest part of the preserved structure, was erected in the first half of the 14th century. Located near the Wawel Castle, it neighbored the Side Gate. By the end of that century, it served as a royal bathhouse, supplied with water from the Rudawka stream – an artificial watercourse flowing along today's Podzamcze Street, encircling the building from the south and west.\n\n\n=== Noble residence ===\nMost likely due to the gradual drying up of the Rudawka stream, maintaining the bathhouse at this location became impractical. In 1390, on August 9th, King Władysław Jagiełło gifted the building to Krystyn of Ostrów, who established his residence there. He expanded the acquired house by adding the adjacent one, purchased from the townsman Tomek, known as Lewek, and his wife Morzka. Additionally, in 1408, he acquired a brick kitchen from the Archbishop of Gniezno, Mikołaj Kurowski. This kitchen was situated outside the city fortifications, so during the adaptation works, it was necessary to incorporate the defensive wall into the house (various parts of the residence were attached to it), thus rendering it devoid of its military function. This was the first instance in Kraków of attaching fortifications to a townhouse.\n\n\n=== Chapter house ===\nIn 1413, with the consent and royal confirmation in a document dated August 25th, Krystyn transferred the building to the cathedral chapter in exchange for tithes from the villages of Kamyk and Sławkowice, granted by Bishop Wojciech Jastrzębiec from his own estates, for the endowment of the altar of Hedwig of Silesia, founded by the nobleman in the Wawel Cathedral. Henceforth, the building, known as the chapter house, was to serve as accommodation for the canons. It was given to Mikołaj Hinczowic of Kazimierz and Jan of Rudzica, who in either 1415 or 1430 carried out extensive renovations at considerable expense. The building, previously referred to as the \"castle bathhouse\" or \"royal bathhouse\", was henceforth known as the \"House of Hińczy\". Additionally, successive canons residing there annually paid two grzywnas for the anniversary, a commemorative mass for Mikołaj.\n\n\n=== Długosz House ===\nThe house, vacant after the death of Jan of Radochońce, was transferred to Jan Długosz by the chapter's decision on 4 February 1450. Perhaps Jan Elgot, his relative, contributed to making this decision. The canon initially lived alone, with the chapter's custodian also entitled to use the house whenever he was in Kraków. In 1453, Długosz was joined by his namesake brother. The building proved too small for the two permanent residents, so a year later, renovations were carried out. A second floor was added to the existing house, and two-story wings were added to the south and west, connected at an angle to form an L-shape. From then on, the entire complex formed a horseshoe with a courtyard in the middle.\nThe fire of 1455 spared this tenement, unlike most of the buildings on Kanonicza Street, which burned down. In June 1461, the Długosz brothers had to leave the house as they were banished, like many supporters of Jakub of Sienno, during the dispute between the chapter and King Casimir IV Jagiellon over the appointment of the Kraków bishopric. Their residence on Kanonicza, during the tumult in which Andrzej Tęczyński was killed on July 16, became a place of brief refuge for the murdered man's son, Jan Rabsztyński, who was also threatened with death. He reached there through the back of the Franciscan monastery, and from this building, he managed to make his way to the royal castle. The house of the proscribed brothers was plundered later that same year by the Kurozwęcki brothers, Stanisław and Dobiesław, acting with the king's consent (December 19). The Długosz brothers returned to Kraków in 1463, receiving ten grzywnas from the chapter for the repair of the building at that time.\nIn the following years, the younger of the brothers occupied the eastern wing of the house, facing Kanonicza Street. Meanwhile, Jan Długosz the elder resided in the newly added section, where he worked on his works, Annales seu cronicae incliti Regni Poloniae (from 1455) and Liber beneficiorum dioecesis Cracoviensis (from 1470). Perhaps it was also one of the places where he imparted knowledge to the sons of Casimir Jagiellon, whom he tutored starting from 1467. After his brother's death in 1471, he shared the building with Jakub of Szadek, a professor at the Jagiellonian University whom he knew well. In 1479, Długosz received a nomination as the Archbishop of Lviv and resigned from his canonry, yet he continued to reside in the chapter house. It was there that he passed away on 19 May 1480. Immediately after Długosz's death, Jakub of Szadek took over the house, and after some time, he was joined by Grzegorz Lubrański.\n\n\n=== Early modern times ===\nAmong the subsequent canons who resided in the building, a notable figure was Maciej Miechowita, a professor and rector of the university, author of the Chronica Polonorum, a continuation of Długosz's chronicle. Miechowita lived there for a while, from 1514, sharing the residence with Maciej Drzewicki. He embellished the house, where he amassed a sizable library and a collection of works of artistic craftsmanship, coins, scientific and musical instruments, maps, and paintings.\nWładysław Łuszczkiewicz associated the renovations of the building with the time of Miechowita (and the canons who occupied the house immediately after him), during which Renaissance elements were introduced, such as cornices above the windows or the portal of the main gate from Kanonicza Street, adorned with a Latin inscription. Although it is generally accepted that reconstruction took place at the beginning of the 16th century, the portal is dated to the second half of that century. Then, in 1571, renovations were carried out on the premises. The external walls were reinforced with buttresses, new window frames were installed, the interiors were decorated with paintings, a kitchen was arranged, and a new bathroom was built. The next renovation took place only in 1775 and included the galleries on the courtyard side and the replacement of the roof. It is possible that it was related to the repairs after the damage caused during the Bar Confederation conflicts.\nAfter the Third Partition of Poland and the incorporation of Kraków into Austria by imperial decree in 1797, the chapter was deprived of most of the buildings on Kanonicza Street. Only eight buildings remained in its possession, including Długosz House, which continued to serve residential purposes. In 1825, it was placed under the administration of the chapter's procuratorship, but already the following year Canon Ludwik Łętowski moved into the building. Finally, in 1839, the house was designated as the seat of the procuratorship, which was located in the eastern wing on Kanonicza Street. Subsequently, it housed successive deputy procurators and chapter notaries.\n\n\n=== Wyspiański's house ===\n\nThirty-four years later (1873), Franciszek Wyspiański rented part of the building. It consisted of three rooms on the ground floor, in the southwest corner. Before moving in with his wife Maria and two sons, the sculptor had to carry out renovations, combined with adaptation for residential purposes. In the large, barrel-vaulted chamber in the southern wing, which had previously served as a coach house, he set up his studio, while in the western wing, he converted two rooms (former stables) into a bedroom for his wife and a kitchen. Some sources suggest that the residential function was fulfilled by a wooden, single-story cottage located near Długosz House (or in its annex), which was connected to it by Wyspiański.\nThe living conditions were quite typical for a significant part of Kraków's contemporary buildings – water available only from wells, lack of sanitary facilities, difficulties with heating the rooms. Over time, the inconveniences began to affect the Wyspiański family, especially the small size of the living area, so Franciszek divided his studio in half with a curtain, keeping one part for himself and allocating the other part for students and as a place to gather materials for work. Długosz House, after a successful period in the artist's life, became a place of creative crisis, alcoholism, depression, and family tragedies – the sudden death of his younger son, Tadeusz (1875), his wife's illness with tuberculosis, and her death (1876). His mother and sister tried to help Wyspiański run the household, moving in while Maria was still alive, which, however, increased the cramped living conditions. After four years (1880), the older son, Stanisław, left, passing under the care of his uncle and aunt, the Stankiewiczes. In the same year, the sculptor also moved from Długosz House to a building on Kopernik Street.\nLiving in the immediate vicinity of Wawel, with a magnificent view of the historic complex of the hill, strongly influenced Stanisław Wyspiański's later work, as did the time spent with his father in his studio, which was also a place for playing with school friends, as recalled later by Stanisław Estreicher and Henryk Opieński. The artist dedicated a poem to this place and the role it played in his life, written in 1903 under the title At the Foot of Wawel, my father had a studio...\n\n\n=== Anniversary of Długosz's death ===\n\nThe four-hundredth anniversary of the chronicler's death in 1880 aroused interest in the building, then still rarely referred to as \"Długosz House\", more often as \"Under the Madonna\", from the image on the facade. Texts discussing its history appeared. In connection with the anniversary celebrations, the chapter renewed the building and also decided to commemorate the chronicler in this place. During the First Congress of Polish Historians (May 18–21, 1880), a stone, fifteenth-century commemorative plaque from the demolished Psalterists' house (Psalterium), founded by Długosz, was embedded in the facade of the southern wing, facing Wawel. In the same year, on July 12, the chapter and the conservator of monuments, Józef Łepkowski, placed an additional plaque there, commemorating the fact that the greatest Polish chronicler of the late Middle Ages lived and worked in this building. The interest in the historic house, which persisted after 1880, was manifested in the depiction of its views, in drawings or photographs. In this way, the building gained a rich iconographic documentation.\n\n\n=== From the late 19th century ===\n\nUntil his death in 1900, Professor Władysław Ignacy Wisłocki, the custodian of the Jagiellonian Library, lived in Długosz House with his family. At the end of the 19th century, the chapter relinquished the building to the episcopal curia. In 1900, a neo-Gothic building for the seminary of the diocese was erected at the back of the house, in place of the garden. This marked the biggest changes in the interior of Długosz House, which was adapted for the needs of the curia and the seminary's economic facilities (a kitchen was arranged in its annex). A renovation of the building took place in 1906.\nThe interwar period brought plans to change the purpose of the building. In 1927, the CEO of Radio Kraków, Bronisław Winiarz, proposed to establish a museum dedicated to Stanisław Wyspiański there as a branch of the National Museum. However, this idea was not implemented at that time, just as it was in 1932 when it was reconsidered.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, historical documentation of Długosz House was developed based on earlier literature and archival materials (Andrzej Fischinger, 1966), and architectural research was also conducted to determine the successive phases of its construction (Waldemar Niewalda and Jerzy Kossowski, 1969). After 1980, renovation work on the building began, and there was once again a proposal to establish a museum there, this time dedicated to Franciszek Wyspiański. The comprehensive restoration of the house was completed in the 1990s, with major work completed by 1990. In 1991, the building was handed over to the then-Academy of Theology, and it was consecrated by Pope John Paul II. The university's rectorate is located there.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\n\tDetails from the facade of Długosz House\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== General description ===\nDługosz House is located at 25 Kanonicza Street, on the corner with Podzamcze Street. It is a building that has been reconstructed several times, with its interiors extensively transformed, resulting in the significant loss of its original character, and the street level around it has been raised. However, compared to the other buildings on Kanonicza Street, it has partially retained its medieval form.\nConstructed from rough stone and brick, the walls were scarped in 1571. It is entirely one-story, forming a horseshoe shape with a courtyard in the middle, closed to the north by the wall of the adjacent building. The southern wing, the result of Długosz's expansion, protrudes further forward towards Wawel than the southern facade of the eastern wing, the older part of the building. The house is covered by a gable roof over the eastern wing and a Polish roof over the Długosz part, introduced in 1775, adorned with vegetal polychrome running along the molding dividing the roofing halfway up its height.\nThe oldest parts of the walls (the former bathhouse) have survived on the ground floor and in the basement, in the corner of the eastern wing. Additionally, Gothic elements are incorporated in various parts of the house, and on the facade facing Kanonicza Street, two large Gothic windows have been preserved, along with a small window from the 15th century above them. Renaissance elements of the building include friezes above the windows and a portal from the second half of the 16th century, decorated with an inscription with the motto Nil est in homine bona mente melius (There is nothing better in a man than a good mind). Inside, architectural stone details from this period and parts of the ceiling frieze have been discovered. Moreover, later galleries from the courtyard side and a carved Jastrzębiec coat of arms on the barrel vault in the vestibule have been preserved.\n\n\n=== Facade painting ===\n\nOn the southern facade of the eastern wing, there is a Baroque painting of the Mother of God with the Child, painted on wood and of natural size. It dates back to the 17th or 18th century. The painting was restored by the painter Lisowski in 1828, then by Wojciech Eliasz in 1863 (at the expense of Ignacy Kruszewski, who was imprisoned in Wawel at that time), and finally by Jan Głuszkiewicz in 1890. The painting bears traces of sixteen bullet holes of unknown origin. These are associated with the times of the Swedish Deluge, the Bar Confederation, or the street fights on 26 April 1848, during the Springtime of the Peoples.\n\n\n=== Plaques on facades ===\nThe oldest of the plaques originates from the Psalterium in Wawel, the house of the college of clergy (sixteen psalterists and a cleric) founded by Jadwiga and Jagiełło in 1393. Jan Długosz renovated this building (or erected a new one in the place of the destroyed one) in 1480. A plaque was placed above the entrance, and only it has survived from the building, which was demolished in 1856 by the Austrians, who were adapting the hill into a citadel. At the expense of the chapter, the relocated plaque was transferred to one of the buildings on Kanonicza Street, and in 1880, during the First Congress of Polish Historians, it was embedded in the facade of the southern wing of the Długosz House, facing Wawel, in place of one of the windows on the upper floor.\n\nThe lower part of it is occupied by an inscription, made in raised, late Gothic letters, describing the foundation:Pro Collegio Psalteristar(um) ecc(lesia)e craeovien (sis) per Wladislau(m) secundu(m) rege(m) et Heduigim reginam(m) Polonie fundato Johannes Longini Cano(n)icus Cracovien(sis) ad honore(m) Dei omnipote(n)tis fabricavit me anno mille(simo)°cccc°octuagesimo\n(Translation: For the Psalterists' College of the Kraków church founded by Władysław II, the king, and Jadwiga, the queen of Poland, Jan Długosz, a canon of Kraków, built me in honor of the Almighty God in the year 1480.)The upper part is a bas-relief depicting the Madonna seated on a throne with the Child on her lap, in front of whom kneels the founder, with folded hands in prayer and eyes directed towards the Virgin Mary. Behind him stands St. John the Baptist, the patron recommending him, holding a book and a lamb in his left hand, and placing his right hand on the kneeling figure's shoulder. The identification of the founder is indicated by the shield with the Wieniawa coat of arms placed at his feet, as well as the attire of the canon – a rochet or alb with wide sleeves, an almuce, and a biretta on his head.\nSuch a representation and the form of the inscription were typical for foundation plaques. What distinguishes them from many other monuments of this kind is the absence of a model of the Psalteria in the hands of the canon. Perhaps this was an expression of the founder's humility or the fact that the building was not erected by him, but only rebuilt. None of the plaques on other buildings erected by Długosz use such a representation pattern.\nDespite some damage, the depiction of the chronicler on the plaque from the Psalteria house drew considerable attention, being the only one made during his lifetime. It was even considered a portrait of Długosz, but later research cast doubt on this judgment. It seems that in this case, it is a stylized image, which conveys the character of the model through external means (clothing, coat of arms), with a conventional expression of his seriousness and dignity. Perhaps the artist, the creator of the plaque, introduced certain realistic elements in the features of the founder's character, especially on the face – full, with a strongly outlined chin, large eyes, and prominent nose, from which two deep grooves run. The assessment of the credibility of this likeness is hindered by the fact that there are no other images of Długosz made during his lifetime. Surely, the sculptor used some real, characteristic features of the founder's physiognomy, although their faithful reproduction was not important to him. The likeness on the plaque is therefore a work on the border between conventionality and portraiture.\n\nBelow the plaque from the Wawel Psalteria, a tablet was placed, which briefly presented this memento of the chronicler in Latin:Diruta Domo Collegii Psalteristarum in monte Wawel MDCCLVI olim a Joanne Dlugosz Can(onico) Ecclesiae Cath.(edralis) Cracov.(iensis) fundata lapis hic unicus ex illa superstes quattuor saeculis post huc translatus est anno Domini MDCCCLXXX.\n(Translation: After the demolition in 1856 of the House of the Psalterists' College, once founded on Wawel Hill by Jan Długosz, a canon of the Krakow Cathedral, this stone, the only one remaining from it, was transferred here 400 years later in the year of Our Lord 1880.)On the same facade, slightly below the line of the second-floor windows and at a certain distance from the relic of the Psalteria, another plaque was unveiled on 12 July 1880, this time in Polish, commemorating the place of Długosz's life and work:Ta część domu dobudowana przez braci Długoszów roku 1450, tu Jan Długosz mieszkał lat 30, tu pisał dzieje Polski i tu umarł 1480 r.\n(Translation: This part of the house, built by the Długosz brothers in 1450, is where Jan Długosz lived for 30 years, where he wrote the history of Poland, and where he died in 1480.)Another commemorative plaque, placed on the house of Długosz from the side of Podzamcze Street, was dedicated to Stanisław Wyspiański. Made of bronze and designed by Bronisław Chromy, it was installed in 1967, on the sixtieth anniversary of the death of the Young Poland artist, in the southern facade of the eastern wing. It was funded by students of the Wyspiański Technical School of Clothing. The plaque features his bust, below which is a stanza from the poem At the foot of Wawel, father had a workshop...\nOn 28 November 2015, during the ceremony closing the Year of Jan Długosz, a new commemorative plaque dedicated to the chronicler was unveiled on the building (from the side of Kanonicza Street). It was designed by Andrzej Zwolak, a professor at the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts, and funded by the Papal University. It bears a quote from the Chronicles – \"Love of the Homeland usually surpasses all other loves\" – in Latin.\n\n\tPlaques from the facade of Długosz House\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Clergy residents of the house ==\nThe following list is provided based on the work of K. Hoszowski, supplemented with information from other sources. Due to gaps in archival material, it is not complete. For some canons, only the date of moving in or out of the house is known, sometimes only the year under which they were recorded as occupying this property. The symbol † next to the end date indicates that the clergyman died while residing in the house; in other cases, leaving the house was related to moving to another building or resigning from a position in the chapter after assuming another ecclesiastical dignity.\n\n\n=== Canons living in the house from the first half of the 15th century to 1839 ===\n\n\n=== Vice-prosecutors and notaries of the chapter residing in the house since 1839 ===\nLudwik Haselquist (vice-prosecutor until 1842), Sylwester Grzybowski (vice-prosecutor until 1850), Józef Godlewski (vice-prosecutor until 1861, from 1850 to 1852 notary), Jan Pietrzykowski (notary until 1861, vice-prosecutor until 1872), Teofil Miodowicz, Józef Krzemiński (notary from 1861 to 1867), Juliusz Bukowski (notary until 1876), Ignacy Polkowski (notary from 1877).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAdamczewski, Jan (2003).

        "content": "John Haddy James (6 July 1788 – 17 March 1869) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJames was the son of a retired Bristol merchant. He was born at Exeter on 6 July 1788. He attended the Exeter grammar school, and at sixteen was apprenticed (in 1805) to Benjamin Johnson, a surgeon, and from 1806 until 1808 to Mr. Patch, surgeon to the Devon and Exeter Hospital. From 1808 to 1812 he was a student at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, residing one of the years in Abernethy's house, and then becoming house-surgeon. He qualified M.R.C.S. in 1811, became assistant-surgeon to the 1st life-guards, and was present at Waterloo. Quitting the service in June 1816, he was elected at the same time (after two previous failures) surgeon to the Devon and Exeter Hospital, and commenced as a general practitioner in Exeter, his residence being in the Cathedral Close. At the hospital he gave lectures on anatomy and physiology, along with Barnes, and began the pathological museum, the catalogue of which occupied much of his leisure. He was a strong advocate of provincial as against exclusively metropolitan medical education, and became one of the original members of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association. At its Liverpool meeting in 1839 he was chosen to give the retrospective address in surgery, and was made president of the Exeter meeting in 1842. He became a town councillor of Exeter in 1820, sheriff in 1826, and mayor in 1828, retiring from municipal business when the old corporation was dissolved in 1835. He was a man of great vigour, bodily and mental, dressed in the old fashion, and professed tory and staunch church principles. In professional matters he was cautious, opinionative, and conservative, a careful, although not an artistic, operator, a most assiduous note-taker (he left eleven manuscript folio volumes of cases written by himself), and gifted with a good memory, which made his large experience available. In 1843 he was nominated one of the first set of honorary fellows of the College of Surgeons under its new charter. In 1858 he resigned the surgeoncy of the Devon and Exeter Hospital (his son succeeding him), but retained until 1868 his favourite duty of curator of the museum, for which he had a house built in the grounds by private subscription in 1853. He died on 17 March 1869 at Southernhay, Exeter, after a lingering illness of five years.\nJames was twice married, first in 1822 to Elizabeth Wittal, who died in 1839, and again in 1840 to Harriet Hills of Exmouth, who survived him. He was the father of nine children by his first wife, only one of whom (his eldest son, a surgeon) died before him.\n‘James of Exeter’ was well known in the profession at large, partly by the spread of his local fame, and partly as a writer on inflammation, and as one of the few surgeons who had tied the abdominal aorta for aneurism of the internal iliac (the patient died in less than three hours, see Med.-Chir. Trans. 1829, vol. xvi.) His writings on inflammation began in 1818, when he won the Jacksonian prize for an essay upon it, printed in 1821; 2nd edit. 1832. He constantly quoted John Hunter and Xavier Bichat, distinguished between the reparative and other effects of inflammation, and maintained that the extent of the process was limited by the quantity of plastic lymph effused. He published a number of other papers, ‘On the Results of Amputation,’ ‘On Hernia,’ ‘On the Scars after Burns,’ &c. (for complete list see Brit. Med. Journ. 1869, i. 319). His literary activity revived in his closing years (1865–9), during which he recurred to the subject of inflammation, made a qualified defence of bleeding, and wrote on ‘Chloroform versus Pain.’\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Creighton, Charles (1892). \"James, John Haddy\".

The wife of J.T. Latham decided to name it New Colony since it was their new home. A local Baptist church was founded in 1889 and several families surnamed Carwile, Elgins, Washington, Crowson, and Martin helped to charter it. Zachariah H. Carwile donated land for another church in 1904. Four years later, it was destroyed by a tornado, but it was rebuilt within a year. A cemetery was located behind the church, and Carwile's grave is the oldest dating back to his death in 1917. It had several homes and businesses in the 1930s. Throughout the 20th century, New Colony was a farming community. It had 65 residents and a woodworking shop as the only business in 2000.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nNew Colony is located on Texas State Highway 59, 4 mi (6.4 km) northeast of Linden in east-central Cass County.\n\n\n== Education ==\nNew Colony had its own school in the 1930s. Today, the community is served by the Linden-Kildare Consolidated Independent School District.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Aith Lifeboat Station is located at Aith, on the island of Shetland, and is the most northerly of the 238 Royal National Lifeboat Institution Lifeboat Stations. A lifeboat was first stationed here by the RNLI in 1933.\nSince 1998, the station has operated a Severn-class All-weather lifeboat, 17-14\tCharles Lidbury (ON 1232), only the fifth lifeboat to have served at Aith.\n\n\n== History ==\nDespite valiant attempts by Lerwick Life-Saving Company, and even the Stromness lifeboat stationed 120 miles away, wrecks such as that of the Aberdeen fishing trawler Ben Doran in March 1930, with the loss of all 9 crew, prompted the RNLI to station a lifeboat in Lerwick, and to look for a location to station a second lifeboat on the west of Shetland.\nIt was decided to station a boat at Aith, as the village could provide sufficient crew, and because Aith Voe was one of the most sheltered mooring locations on the west coast. James Tait, DSM, was appointed Coxswain, another James Tait appointed Second Coxswain, and William Tait appointed Bowman. Charles Mowat, Assistant Mechanic at Lerwick, was appointed to be Aith Mechanic.\nThe first boat on station in January 1933, and was a 45ft 6in Watson-class lifeboat, built in 1926 by S. E. Saunders of Cowes, with a 80 h.p. engine delivering a speed of 8kts. She had previously served for seven years at Longhope, and was named K. T. J. S. (ON 698), in reference to her benefactors, Mr King, Mr Turnball, Mr Jesset and Mrs Sandford.\nAfter a year, the RNLI announced that the Aith station was permanent, and a house was constructed for the Mechanic. A new boat was provided to Aith in 1935, a 51-foot Barnett-class lifeboat, constructed at Groves and Guttridge, of Cowes, and costing just over £9000. She was the gift of Miss Maggie Rankin, made in memory of her brothers, both Marine Engineers from Greenock, and was named The Rankin (ON 776) on 12 May 1935. In 25 years of service, she was launched 52 times, and saved 61 lives.\n\n\n== Notable rescues ==\nJust before 6:00am on the morning of 19 February 1967, the James and Frances Macfarlane (ON 956) was launched to the aid of the Aberdeen trawler Juniper, which had run aground in Lyra Sound, between Lyra Skerry and the west side of Papa Stour. Considerable skill, navigation and seamanship in force 8 conditions was required to bring the lifeboat to the side of Juniper, and to effect the rescue of the 12 crew. The lifeboat, crew and survivors landed in Aith at 9:35am.\nFor this service, Coxswain John R. Nicholson was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal, the rest of the crew being awarded \"The Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\". Coxswain Nicholson would later receive the 1967 Maud Smith Award.\n\n\n== Station Honours ==\nThe following are awards made at Aith\n\nRNLI Silver Medal\nJohn R Nicholson, Coxswain - 1967\nThe Maud Smith Award 1967(for the bravest act of lifesaving during the year by a member of a lifeboat crew)\nJohn R Nicholson, Coxswain - 1968\nThe Thanks of the Institution inscribed on Vellum\nAndrew Smith, Acting Second Coxswain - 1968\nJames Mason, Acting Bowman - 1968\nFrank Johnston, Motor Mechanic - 1968\nWilbert Clark, Acting Assistant Mechanic - 1968\nWilliam Anderson, crew member - 1968\nKenneth Henry, crew member - 1968\nA.

        "content": "The Northern Operational Group of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (Ukrainian: Оперативна група УПА-Північ, romanized: Operatyvna hrupa UPA-Pivnich), also known as UPA-North (Ukrainian: УПА-Північ, romanized: UPA-Pivnich), was one of the three operational groups of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. It operated in Volhynia, Zhytomyr Oblast, Kyiv Oblast, and in the southern Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\n\n== History ==\nUPA-North was established in 1943, alongside the Western and Southern operational groups. A fourth group, the Eastern Operational Group, was conceived but never formally established.\nPrior to the creation of UPA-North, there had already been two organisations known as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army operating in Volhynia and Polesia. The older organisation, created in the spring of 1942, was a group of 300-500 soldiers commanded by Taras Bulba-Borovets, better known as the Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army. The later organisation was the Ukrainian Insurgent Army belonging to Stepan Bandera's wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, which began operating in February 1943. Efforts were made in March 1943 to unify the two groups, but were unsuccessful, owing to the Banderites launching an insurgency against German occupational forces. In the summer of 1943, Dmytro Klyachkivsky decided to attack supporters of Borovets and Andriy Melnyk. This process led to the successful unification of Ukrainian forces in Volhynia and Polesia under the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.\nThe Northern Operational Group was heavily involved in the massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia. A directive from the period called on soldiers of the operational group to \"destroy all traces of the Poles\" by \"destroying all Polish churches and all other Polish places of worship. Destroy all farm homes, so there is no evidence that anyone ever lived there.\"\nKlyachkivsky, UPA-North's first commander, died in battle with Soviet troops on 12 February 1945, and he was succeeded by Mykola Kozak. In September 1945, he was succeeded by Petro Oliinyk, who served until his own death in 1946. After him was Ivan Lytvynchuk, who died on 19 January 1951. By the time Oliinyk had become commander, however, UPA-North had effectively ceased to exist as a result of Soviet counter-insurgency efforts.\nUPA-North continued to operate in a greatly-reduced form in southern Belarus until late 1953, when the group was completely crushed by Soviet troops.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe Northern Operational Group drew Ukrainians from primarily working-class backgrounds, and has been characterised as more reflective of a \"workers' and peasants' army\" than Soviet partisans by Ukrainian historian Ivan Patryliak. Several Ukrainians in Belarus also joined UPA-North, with the total number of Belarusian members being as many as 15,000. Belarusians had a separate unit within the UPA, commanded by Oleksandr Stepaniuk from 1949.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Northern Operational Group comprised four different military districts:\n\n1st Military District (also known as Zahrava), under the command of Ivan Lytvynchuk, oversaw units in northern Rivne Oblast.\n2nd Military District (also known as Bohun), under the command of Petro Oliinyk, commanded troops in southern Rivne Oblast.\n3rd Military District (also known as Turiv), under the command of Yurii Stelmashchuk, commanded troops in Volyn Oblast and the Byelorussian SSR's Brest Region.\n4th Military District (also known as Tiutiunnyk), under the command of Fedir Vorobets, commanded troops in Zhytomyr Oblast and western Kyiv Oblast.\nUPA-North possessed a slightly different organisation from the other operational groups; while UPA-South lacked any sub-groups below military districts and UPA-West had \"tactical groups\", UPA-North had two sub-groups for military districts, \"raion\" and \"nadraion\".\n\n\n== References ==",

The son, who was mainly brought up by his grandparents and by his uncle, T. B. Keetley, a medical practitioner of Grimsby, was educated at Browne's school there, and acted as ‘surgery help’ or unarticled apprentice to his uncle during the last years of his school life. He then attended the lectures on botany and anatomy at the Hull school of medicine. He entered St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1871, matriculated at the London University, and in 1874 obtained the two gold medals at the intermediate examination in medicine, one for anatomy, the other for organic chemistry, materia medica, and pharmaceutical chemistry. He took no degree. He was admitted M.R.C.S. England, and F.R.C.S. in 1876. He became L.R.C.P. in 1873. After serving in 1875 as house-surgeon to the Queen's Hospital, Birmingham, and taking general practice at Bungay in Suffolk, he was from 1876 to 1878 an assistant demonstrator of anatomy in the medical school of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.\nIn 1878 he was elected assistant surgeon at the West London Hospital, and with this hospital he was associated until his death. During his thirty years' service, and mainly by his advice, the hospital grew from a small suburban venture into a great charity, to which was attached a postgraduate medical school of the first importance. At the outset Keetley introduced into the wards and operating theatre the antiseptic methods of modern surgery before they had been adopted to any great extent by the other hospitals in London. He advocated the operation of appendicotomy and wrote a valuable handbook on orthopædic surgery (London, 1900). In 1882 he was foremost in founding, and was the first president of, the West London Medico-Chirurgical Society. He also originated and organised with Mr. Herbert Chambers an army medical civilian reserve, which was afterwards merged into the territorial force as the Third London General Hospital corps.\nA slight but incurable deafness and want of business aptitude hampered Keetley's professional success. A keen athlete in early life, he was well known as a football player, boxer, and oarsman; he was a skilful artist and caricaturist with pen and pencil, and had a gift for impromptu rhymes. He died on 4 December 1909 at Brighton, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.\nHe married Anna, daughter of Henry Holmes Long of the East India Company, but had no children.\nKeetley, who was co-editor of the ‘Annals of Surgery,’ vols. i.–xiv. (London and New York, 1885–91), published: \n\n‘The Student's Guide to the Medical Profession,’ 1878; 2nd edit. 1885.\n‘An Index of Surgery,’ 1881; 4th edit. 1887.\n‘Orthopædic Surgery; a Handbook,’ 1900.\n‘Kallos. A Treatise on the Scientific Culture of Personal Beauty and the Cure of Ugliness,’ 1883; this work deals with the influence of Hellenic culture on the world's ideal of beauty, and in it Keetley anticipated some of the ideals of the later eugenics school.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1912). \"Keetley, Charles Robert Bell\".

        "content": "Daniel Kenrick (fl. 1685), also called Daniel Kendrick, was an English physician and poet.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKenrick was the son of Samuel Kenrick of Leigh, Gloucestershire. He was born about 1652, and entered as a servitor at Christ Church, Oxford, on 31 March 1666, whence he proceeded B.A. 1669, and M.A. 1674. At the age of thirty-two, when his portrait was engraved by Robert White, Kenrick was practising as a doctor at his native town of Worcester, and was much esteemed there as ‘a man of wit and a jolly companion.’ Several poems by ‘Dr. Kenrick’ appear in ‘The Grove, or a Collection of Original Poems, by W. Walsh, Dr. J. Donne, Mr. Dryden, Mr. Butler, Sir John Suckling, and other eminent hands,’ London, 1721. Kenrick's ‘talents,’ it is declared in the preface, ‘seem equal in panegyrick, satire, and lyric. There is a fire and sprightliness of thinking which runs through all his copies, and to this perhaps he owed that haste in his writing which made him sometimes negligent of Harmony both in Rimes and Numbers.’ We gather from the same source that Kenrick was on terms of intimacy with Mrs. Behn and Purcell the musician, and that he died before the publication of ‘The Grove’ in 1721. There are some verses signed by Kenrick in the fifth vol. of Dryden's ‘Miscellany Poems,’ entitled ‘Upon a Giant Angling.’ These, however, are said by Granger, ‘on the information of Dr. John Wall,’ to have been freely borrowed from a work called ‘The Mock Romans,’ London, 1653, while in Pratt's ‘Cabinet of Poetry’ (1808) these same lines are assigned to Dr. William King. The preface to ‘The Grove’ declares that Kenrick took degrees in divinity as well as physic. He may therefore be identical with Daniel Kenrick, D.D., who preached the assize sermon at Worcester in 1688.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Seccombe, Thomas (1892). \"Kenrick, Daniel\".

Bittar has discussed his own style, saying \"I like to create discrepancies, to cover the tracks. And if I can do it with a touch of humor, I do it.\"\nHe was a Golden Buzzer Winner in 2023 in France's Got Talent.

        "content": "The Lady in Red is a musical in three acts with music by Robert Winterberg and both book and lyrics by Anne Caldwell. It was an Americanized version of Winterberg's earlier German-language operetta Die Dame in Rot (1911) with entirely new lyrics and dialogue by Caldwell and some new music by Winterberg in addition to some of the music from the earlier 1911 work. However, most of Winterberg's original score had been replaced by songs by a variety of American songwriters, many of them uncredited. Composer George Gershwin contributed one new song to this show, \"Something About Love\", which contained lyrics by Lou Paley.\nThe Lady in Red premiered at Broadway's Lyric Theatre on March 12, 1919.  This new version of Winterberg's operetta was created as a starring vehicle for Adele Rowland who portrayed Kitty St. Claire. Directed by Frank Smithson and produced by John P. Slocum, the production ran on Broadway for a total of 48 performances, closing on June 21, 1919.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n​The Lady in Red​ at the Internet Broadway Database",

        "content": "Sorensenella is a genus in the harvestman subfamily Sorensenellinae in the family Triaenonychidae. It is endemic to New Zealand and currently includes three species and several subspecies. Members of this genus have large pedipalps armed with strong spines. The pedipalps are larger in males.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe genus Sorensenella was erected by R.I. Pocock in 1903. The type species is Sorensenalla prehensor and is held at the Natural History Museum, London. Carl Freidrich Roewer erected the genus Akaroa in 1932, but Ray Forster synonymised this under Sorensenella in his monograph on the New Zealand Laniatores. Forster spelled the genus as Soerensenella, but Sorensenella is the original spelling.\nSorensenella contains the following species and subspecies:\n\nSorensenella prehensor Pocock, 1903\nSorensenella prehensor prehensor Pocock, 1903\nSorensenella prehensor nitida Forster, 1954\nSorensenella prehensor obesa Forster, 1954\nSorensenella bicornis Pocock, 1903\nSorensenella bicornis bicornis Pocock, 1903\nSorensenella bicornis parva Forster, 1954\nSorensenella bicornis waikanae Forster, 1954\nSorensenella rotara Phillipps & Grimmett, 1932\n\nForster's revision includes keys to species for most of the genera it covers, but not for Sorensenella. However, Forster did include the species and subspecies of Sorensenella in a larger key to New Zealand Opiliones published in two parts.\nForster also erected the subfamily Sorensenellinae to accommodate Sorensenella Pocock, 1903 and Karamea Forster, 1954 from New Zealand, and Roeweria Lawrence, 1931 (now Lawrencella Strand, 1932) and Speleomontia Lawrence, 1931 from South Africa.\n\n\n== General appearance ==\nIn Sorensenella, the dorsal (upper) surface has one or two spinous tubercles (conical projections) located on the sides of the carapace and level with or forward of the eyemound (a raised, rounded structure with two eyes). These are pointing at or near right angles to the body. The eyemound has a small spine on the apex. Behind the eyemound, the carapace has several pairs of tubercles, while the free tergites (the rearmost portion each have a row of weak tubercles. The pedipalps are strongly armed with spines and are larger in males than females. Body colouring is typically in shades of brown, grey or black, The chelicerae and pedipalps are commonly red-brown or other shades of brown and are a lighter tone and glossier than the rest of the body. Sorensenella most closely resembles the New Zealand-endemic genus Karamea, but lacks the prominent, forward-directed eyemound spine of the latter.\n\n\n== Geographic range ==\nSoerensenella is only found in New Zealand. In the North Island, it is more commonly seen in central and northern regions, with no records south of Waikanae. In the South Island it is found in the Canterbury region. Its range does not appear to overlap with that of Karamea.\n\n\n== Phylogenetics ==\nMolecular studies using Sanger and ultra conserved element sequencing showed Sorensenella is part of a clade that includes the majority of New Zealand triaenonychid genera, as well as several genera from Australia, New Caledonia and South America. Sorensenella forms a subclade with its nearest relative Karamea, and these genera are estimated to have diverged from one another during the Cretaceous.  While these studies affirm the close relationship between Soerensenella and Karamea, they do not support Forster's inclusion of Roeweria (now Lawrencella) and Speleomontia from South Africa in Sorensenellinae.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Floyd Karkeek (9 September 1802 – 25 June 1858) was an English veterinary surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nKarkeek was born at Truro on 9 September 1802, and obtained his diploma as a veterinary surgeon on 31 January 1825. He became a leading authority in the west of England on scientific farming, and did much to encourage it in Cornwall by reading papers at the meetings of agricultural societies, and by acting as judge at various cattle-shows. He was for twenty years secretary to the Cornwall Agricultural Association, and was from 1838 to 1841 one of the editors of ‘The Veterinarian.’ He died at Pentreve, Truro, on 25 June 1858 from the effects of a carriage accident, and was buried in the St. Mary's burial-ground. He married, 12 March 1836, at Clifton, Bristol, Jane (1815–1870), daughter of Paul and Grace Quick, and left issue.\nKarkeek published: \n\n‘An Essay on Artificial and other Manures,’ 1844.\n‘An Essay on Fat and Muscle.’ This gained a prize from the Royal Agricultural Society; appeared in vol. v. of its ‘Journal’ (1845), and was published separately, London, 1844.\n‘On the Farming of Cornwall,’ an elaborate report, which also gained a prize from the Royal Agricultural Society; appeared in its ‘Journal,’ vol. vi., 1845, and was reprinted in 1845.\n‘Diseases of Cattle and Sheep caused by Mismanagement;’ another prize essay, ‘Journal of Royal Agricultural Society,’ vol. xi. (1850), and separately, London, 1851. Karkeek also published two essays on like subjects in the ‘Journal of the Bath and West of England Society,’ which were both reprinted.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Archbold, William Arthur Jobson (1892). \"Karkeek, William Floyd\".

        "content": "Bill Eversole (born March 3, 1963) is an American former professional stock car racing driver who competed in the NASCAR Busch Series and the ARCA Re/Max Series.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\nIn 2001, Eversole made his ARCA Re/Max Series debut at Kentucky Speedway, driving the No. 10 Ford, where he started 31st and finished eleven laps down in 25th place. He then made two more starts that year with Venturini Motorsports, finishing 31st at the first Michigan International Speedway event due to engine issues, and finishing four laps down in sixteenth at the second Michigan race. He then made only one start the following year in 2002, driving the No. 08 Ford for Steve Murillo at Michigan, where he 39th after running only eight laps due to rear end issues.\nIn 2003, Eversole joined Brad Kemp Motorsports and drove the No. 08 Chevrolet for the full schedule. He finished seventh in the final points standings with nine top-tens and went on to win rookie of the year honors at the end of the year. Afterwards, he made only three starts in 2004, getting a best finish of sixth at the first Michigan race. It was also during this year that he attempted to make his NASCAR Busch Series debut at Michigan, driving the No. 72 Chevrolet for MacDonald Motorsports, where he qualified in 26th but finished in 37th in the race. He also attempted to make his second Busch start at Kansas Speedway later in the year, this time driving the No. 56 Chevrolet for MacHill Motorsports, but ultimately failed to qualify.\nIn 2005, Eversole drove for Norm Benning Racing at the season opening race for ARCA at Daytona International Speedway, where he started thirteenth but finished in 35th due to being involved in a multi car crash midway through the race. Afterwards, he drove the No. 08 for Hardcore Motorsports for all but the final three races on the schedule, getting three top-tens with a best finish of fifth at the Illinois State Fairgrounds dirt track to finished fifteenth in the final points standings. For the following year, Eversole only attempted the two Michigan ARCA races, driving the No. 7 Dodge for Bobby Gerhart Racing, failing to qualify for the first event and finishing nineteenth in the second event. The second Michigan race is his most recent start as a driver, as he has not competed in the series since then.\n\n\n== Motorsports results ==\n\n\n=== NASCAR ===\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

        "content": "Lanier is an unincorporated community in Cass County, Texas, United States. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 43 in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area in what is known as Lanier today was first settled in the early 1870s and was three miles south of where the community currently stands. It was named after Lanier, Georgia, where one of the first settlers was born. It had a store and 30 residents in 1884. The population went up to 50 in 1896 and had two churches. The population declined and its original post office closed shortly after. The Jefferson and Northwestern Railroad completed a track to Linden in 1912 and bypassed Lanier, causing its residents to move three miles north to its present location. Another post office was established at Lanier in 1913 and remained in operation until 1929. The population ranged from a low of 25 in 1925 to 150 in 1929. It soon returned to 25 in 1933. In 1983, it had 40 residents served by a cemetery, one business, and two churches, and remained at that level in 1990. Lanier gained three more residents in 2000.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nLanier is located on Texas State Highway 59, 5 mi (8.0 km) south of Linden in Cass County.\n\n\n== Education ==\nToday, the community is served by the Linden-Kildare Consolidated Independent School District.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Feuerkogel is a mountain located in Gmunden District and the state of Upper Austria, in the central part of the country, 200 km west of the capital Vienna. The summit of Feuerkogel is 1,592 meters above sea level. Feuerkogel forms the eastern end of the Höllengebirge, which stretches between Lake Attersee and Lake Traunsee and protrudes towards the southern shore of Lake Traunsee. Höllengebirge belongs to the Northern Limestone Alps.\nThe terrain around Feuerkogel is mountainous to the south, but to the north, it is hilly. The highest point nearby is Alberfeldkogel, 1,707 meters above sea level, 1.3 km west of Feuerkogel. The nearest major community is Ebensee, 4.3 km east of Feuerkogel.\n\n\n== Vegetation ==\nIn the surroundings of Feuerkogel, primarily consists mixed coniferous forest. Around Feuerkogel, it is quite densely populated, with 65 inhabitants per square kilometer. The area is part of the hemiboreal climatic zone.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe average annual temperature in the area is 6 °C. The warmest month is July, with an average temperature of 17 °C, and the coldest is January, with -8 °C. The average annual precipitation is 1,801 millimeters. The rainiest month is August, with an average of 213 mm of precipitation, and the driest is March, with 89 mm of precipitation.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nSince 1927, a cable car has been running from Ebensee up to the mountain to the Feuerkogel hotel. The cable car facilitates hiking access to get up to the mountain and thus enables tours to Großer Höllkogel or crossing the Höllengebirge to Hochleckenhaus, including the intermediate station Rieder Hütte. As early as 1936, there was a ski lift for about 8 people. Today, however, there are lift facilities totaling 12 kilometers to the ski slopes. A very demanding 6 km long ungroomed descent leads directly from the mountain down to the built-up area at Ebense.\n\n\n== Arrangement ==\nOn the occasion of the 80th birthday of the cable car, a big party and a traditional Nostalgia ski race were held between March 3 and 4, 2007. The sporting highlight is the Feuerkogel Mountain Race, which takes place every August. It is the most popular mountain race in Austria. In 1997, the European Mountain Running Championships were held.\n\n\n== Wind measurements ==\nOn December 26, 1999, the highest wind speed ever measured in Austria, 220 km/h, was recorded on the summit of the Feuerkogel. Due to its altitude, the wind measuring station on the Feuerkogel continues to register record-breaking values. During Cyclone Kyrill in January 2007, Austria experienced its highest wind speed from the cyclone, measured at 207 km/h. This event further emphasizes the ongoing record-breaking wind speeds observed by the Feuerkogel's wind measuring station, attributable to its high elevation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nUtsikt från Feuerkogel (in German).",

        "content": "Karl Schädler (/ʃˈɛdlər/, German: [kˈaɾl ʃˈɛdlɜ]; 26 January 1850 – 21 December 1907) was an engineer and political figure from Liechtenstein who served in the Landtag of Liechtenstein.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nSchädler was born on 26 January 1850 in Vaduz to the son of his father by the same name Karl Schädler and his mother Katharina Walser as one of nine children, including his brothers Albert Schädler and Rudolf Schädler. He lived in the city throughout his childhood before attending secondary school in Freiburg im Breisgau and Schwyz. He studied civil engineering at the University of Zurich and the University of Stuttgart respectively.\nFrom 1872 to 1881, he worked at a railway construction company in Württemberg, and then from 1882 to 1890, he operated an independent building contractor in both the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. From 1890 to 1893, Schädler oversaw the construction of a railway line in Venezuela and also various tunnels and bridges. He returned to Liechtenstein in 1893, and due to his ventures in engineering, he had amassed a considerable fortune.\n\n\n== Political career and patronage ==\nUpon his return to Liechtenstein in 1893, Schädler, similarly to his brothers before him, became active in politics. In 1894, he was elected into the Landtag of Liechtenstein, where he served until his death in 1907. In 1907, he, along with fellow Landtag members Jakob Kaiser and Fritz Walser pressed to create a new press law, but this was turned down by Governor of Liechtenstein Carl von In der Maur. Throughout his time in the Landtag, Schädler advocated for the expansion of civil rights in Liechtenstein. The Christian-Social People's Party, formed in 1918, considered some of his ideas as the founding principles of the party.\n\nIn 1898, he was a founder of the Vaduz rifle club and its first president from 1898 to 1907. In 1894, he bought the spa and health resort in Gaflei, which he ran alongside his brother Rudolf until 1907. During this time, he expanded the business to include 100 beds and built a new building. It also included the building of a new road from Gaflei to the resort, which allowed it to become one of the most occupied tourist destinations in Liechtenstein during and in the years after Schädler's lifetime. From 1906, he was an honorary member of the Vaduz fire brigade. \nSchädler died on 21 December 1907, aged 56 years old. In his will, he bequeathed a large portion of his wealth into educational and poor aid developments in Liechtenstein, including, but not limited to the expansion of the Vaduz state school, a church in Balzers, funding for the poor houses in Triesen, Eschen, and Vaduz and the formation of a foundation to support the education of people in his family. In 1908, a monument was set up in Gaflei in his honour.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n Venezuela: Order of the Liberator (1894)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "CompuGroup Medical SE & Co. KGaA (also known as CGM) is a publicly listed software company based in Koblenz that develops and offers software for the healthcare sector. It produces application software to support medical and organizational activities in doctors' practices, pharmacies, medical laboratories and hospitals. According to its own figures, the company employed more than 9200 people worldwide in 2022and has over 1.6 million users in 56 countries.\nCompuGroup Medical shares have been included in the TecDAX stock market index since September 2013.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1984, Jürgen Riebling, Peter Kirchdorfer, Ursula Spitta, Max-Georg Prahl and Walter Schäfer founded Compudent GmbH, which became a public company in 1986. In 1992, Frank Gotthardt took over all the ordinary shares and merged Compudent with his company \"Gotthardt Computer GmbH\" in Koblenz, whereby the name \"Compudent AG\" was retained. Initially, dental information systems were offered, followed by software in 1993. In 1997, the company was renamed Compugroup Holding AG.\nIn 2004, the company entered the Czech Republic with doctor information systems for registered doctors and dentists. In the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland the company soon entered the field of hospital information systems. The company also developed information systems for physicians in France, Spain and Italy. In Germany, several products were added to the portfolio: medical archiving solutions, hospital information systems, multimedia communication services, drug information systems, laboratory information systems, a referring physician portal and administration software. In addition, web-based patient files were launched and intelligent assistance systems for doctors were developed.\nIn order to realize plans for internationalization, the owner decided in 1997 to change the name from Compudent AG to CompuGroup AG, which was implemented around the turn of the millennium. In 2010, the CompuGroup Holding was renamed CompuGroup Medical and united with the subsidiaries that had emerged in the meantime under this umbrella brand. In 2016, the transition from a stock corporation under German law to a Societas Europaea under European law took place.\nIn February 2020, CompuGroup Medical announced that it had signed a purchase agreement for part of the IT healthcare portfolio of healthcare software company Cerner in Germany and Spain. The main products of the acquired portfolio are medico and Soarian Integrated Care, leading hospital information systems in Germany, Selene, a leading hospital information system in Spain, and Soarian Health Archive, an archive solution for healthcare facilities.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nIn 2017, the company had around 4,600 employees at locations in 19 countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the USA.

        "content": "Pebanista is an extinct genus of platanistid \"river dolphin\" that lived during the Early to Middle Miocene in Peru. As a member of the Platanistidae, Pebanista is most closely related to the extant Ganges and Indus river dolphins (Platanista) of South Asia and shares no close relation to the modern Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) that inhabits the same region today. Like its close relatives, Pebanista possesses enlarged crests that would have covered the melon in life, possibly helping to focus their biosonar while hunting in murky waters. Pebanista further stands out as being the largest \"river dolphin\" yet discovered, reaching lengths between 2.8–3.47 m (9 ft 2 in – 11 ft 5 in) at minimum, much larger than the biggest recorded freshwater cetaceans of today. Given its relatively robust if elongated snout, it is thought that Pebanista was an active predator, profiting from the rich prey selection available to it in the enormous Pebas wetlands that covered South America during the early parts of the Miocene. Only a single species of Pebanista is known: P. yacuruna.\n\n\n== History and naming ==\nPebanista was described based on MUSM 4017, a nearly complete skull recovered from the early to middle Miocene strata of the Pebas Formation in Peru. More specifically, the fossil was discovered in 2018 near the Rio Napo in the province of Loreto in sediments that indicate that it dates to the latest Early Miocene. The specimen is currently housed at the Museo de Historia Natural de la Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos. The team that described Pebanista, headed by Aldo Benites-Palomino, also highlight two additional fossils that may be referrable to this genus or a related form. Namely MUSM 3593, a fragment of a snout tentatively referred to as cf. Pebanista, and MUSM 4759, a tympanic bulla only identified as Platanistidae indet. While the latter also stems from the Pebas Formation, the former was discovered in strata of the Ipururo Formation.\nThe name Pebanista is composed of Pebas, in reference to the name of the formation and ancient wetland system that this animal once inhabited, and the genus name of the modern South Asian river dolphins Platanista. The name was specifically chosen to reflect both the close relationship between Pebanista and Platanista as well as its specific geographic origin, highlighting the great distance between the two taxa. The species name meanwhile derives from the yacuruna, mythical water beings of the Quechua people of the Peruvian Amazon.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe snout or rostrum of Pebanista; formed chiefly by the bones of the premaxillae, maxillae and vomers; is elongated (longirostrine) and flattened top to bottom (dorsoventrally). In this regard the taxon bears close resemblance to other extinct platanistid dolphins like Prepomatodelphis, Pomatodelphis and Zarhachis, whereas the rostrum of extant Platanista has flattened sides (transverse compression). Additionally, the rostrum of Pebanista doesn't simply lack transverse compression, but actually shows a much greater transverse robustness than any other platanistid. Several tooth sockets are preserved in the holotype specimen, indicating that the animal had proportionally larger teeth than its relatives.\nPossibly the most distinct trait of the two extant Platanista species are the enlarged supraorbital crests, thin and pneumatic structures that encase large parts of the melon, a key organ used by toothed whales to echolocate. A similar crest can be found in Pebanista, showing the same transverse flattening of the bony plates that sets them apart from more basal forms such as Pomatodelphis and Zarhachis. At the same time, the crests of Pebanista are more robust than what is seen in Platanista, somewhat like an intermediate between it and the marine forms. Another major difference lies in the structural origins of the crests. In Pebanista the supraorbital crests are formed by the frontal bones, while in Platanista it is the maxillae that form these structures. Pomatodelphis and Zarhachis meanwhile show a mix between the two conditions, with both the frontals and the maxillae participating in forming the crests. The dorsomedial margin of the crests, the upper edges that faces inward towards the midline of the skull, show several prominent open spaces referred to as vacuities or cavities. Benites-Palomino and colleagues hypothesize that these cavities may have been an early stage in the development of fully excavated supraorbital crests as seen in today's Platanista species.\nThe supraorbital crests arch over the medial part of the skull and form the lateral border to the circumnarial basin, with the back of said basin being restricted by the nuchal crest. This gives the back of the skull a more rectangular appearance. The circumnarial basin is a large depression in the upper surface of the skull that surrounds the bony nares, which in Pebanista are shifted towards the left side, contributing to the asymmetry among the facial bones. This is regarded a notable feature that helps identify Pebanista as a platanistid. This asymmetry is not simply limited to the nares either. The highest point of the skull, the vertex is shifted towards the left as well, as are the premaxillae and several facial bones. Only a single orbit is preserved in the holotype, however, based on this it appears to have been proportionally shorter, which is only shared by species of Platanista and not seen in other members of the family. The ventral surface of the skull prominently displays the pterygoid bones, which obscure the vast majority of the palatines sans narrow regions exposed towards the side of the skull. The temporal fossae, which stretch across the lateral surface of the skull on either side, are noted to be longer than they are high and extend so far back that they enter the occipital region. Vice versa, the occipital shield might project slightly forward into the anterior parts of the skull, however, it is likewise possible that this condition was simply caused by the skull being distorted during preservation.\n\n\n=== Size ===\n\nThe skull of Pebanista has a bizygomatic width of 28.1 cm (11.1 in) and a preserved condylobasal length of 69.8 cm (27.5 in). Given the fusion among the individual skull bones, it is inferred that the holotype skull was that of an adult animal. Based on the bizygomatic width, the type specimen was estimated to have had a total body length of approximately 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in). Furthermore, the size of the much less complete referred specimens may indicate even greater lengths were possible. MUSM 3593, a snout fragment, could have belonged to an animal 3.47 m (11.4 ft) long.\nHowever, it is noted by Benites-Palomino and colleagues that regression equations using bizygomatic width, as used in calculating these results, could underestimate the lengths of taxa with highly elongated snouts. Alternatively, the condylobasal length  of the skull could be used in order to determine total body length, but since this value is not known in full for Pebanista it has been proposed that the range indicated by the bizygomatic width should be treated as the minimum. Regardless, even these lower estimates exceed the size of any modern river dolphin, which grow up to a maximum legnth of only around 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in).\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\n\nAll phylogenetic analyses conducted in the type description recovered Pebanista to be a member of the Platanistidae, a family of toothed whales that include the modern Indus and Ganges river dolphin alongside a variety of marine forms. The initial analysis, conducted using equal weighting of characters, was poorly resolved, its clades often weakly supported and with several polytomies. Later analyses were conducted using implied weighting of characters, greatly improving the resolution of the results. These analyses recover two well supported clades within Platanistidae, one formed by Pomatodelphis and Zarhachis, and another formed by Pebanista and Platanista. This means that Pebanista is the closest known relative to the only extant members of the family.\n\n\n== Evolutionary History ==\n\nOf the once diverse clade Platanistoidea, only two species are still alive today, the Ganges river dolphín (Platanista gangetica) and the Indus river dolphin (Platanista minor), both of which are largely restricted to their namesake river systems in South Asia. During the Oligocene and Miocene members of this group were much more widespread, occurring across the world in marine strata and developing a wide range of forms that occupied different niches. Platanistids are thought to have reached their peak during the Early Miocene amidst global cooling, but began to decline towards the Middle Miocene when sperm whales, beaked whales and delphinoids began to emerge.\nToothed whales are known to have transitioned from marine environments into freshwater habitats multiple times throughout their evolutionary history, with four distinct groups of such \"river dolphins\" persisting into the Holocene (although Lipotidae have recently gone extinct while Pontoporiidae are not strictly freshwater animals). The salt- to freshwater transition of the Iniidae (South American river dolphins) is hypothesized to have occurred at some point towards the Late Miocene given the appearance of Ischyrorhynchus in rivers and deltas of Argentina during this time period, while marine forms persisted until the Pliocene. Platanistids meanwhile appear to have first ventured into freshwater during the Early to Middle Miocene, as evidenced not only by Pebanista but also based on the discovery of Platanista-like earbones recovered from La Venta (Colombia) and the Fitzcarrald Arch (Peru) that could represent close relatives.\n\n\n== Paleobiology ==\n\nDuring the Early and Middle Miocene large areas of what is now the Amazon Rainforest used to be covered by an extensive wetland system. This wetland, known as the Pebas System or Pebas Megawetlands, was subject to at least two marine incursions and featured both freshwater and brackish environments that housed a highly diverse ecosystem. In addition to Pebanista, the fossils of giant crocodilians, turtles, fish, various ungulates and sloths are all known from localities corresponding with the wetland system. The presence of gharials, a group of longirostrine crocodilians, is highlighted in particular given the many parallels to platanistids. Both Pebanista and Gryposuchus, one of the many native gharials, descend from marine ancestors before diversifying further inland, growing to sizes much larger than their extant kin (which are all restricted to South Asia). The increase in size may be related to the abundance of prey items these animals would have found within the wetlands, allowing Pebanista to maintain a body size similar to its marine relatives. The anatomy of Pebanista does support the hypothesis that it was an active raptorial animal, possessing enlarged teeth, a robust snout and prominent skeletal features that serve as insertion points for powerful musculature.\nThe supraorbital crests show some areas of varying density, with the outer section being denser than those more medially (aided by the presenve of cavities along the medial edge). Given that the supraorbital crests arch across the upper surface of the skull and are concave along their inner surface, thus covering the melon, it has been suggested that the crests served as a tool to focus the sound waves emitted by the animals biosonar. As suggested by Benites-Palomino and colleagues, the anatomy of the supraorbital crest in Pebanista may be a step towards what we now see in Platanista. In the extant species, the crest is even more developed, with echolocation serving such a dominant function in locating prey in murky water that modern Platanista are nearly blind.\n\n\n== References ==",

The genus contains a single species, K. gratus, known from a partial cranium.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\n\nThe Kermitops holotype specimen, USNM 407585, was discovered by Nicholas Hotton III and field scientists from the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in April 1984. The type locality is represented by the lower sediments of the Clear Fork Formation near Lake Kemp in Wilbarger County, Texas, United States. The specimen consists of most of the skull roof, a partial braincase, and the mandibles. Most of the palate is not preserved, except for some incomplete vomerine teeth. The marginal teeth are not readily observable.\nIn 2024, So, Pardo & Mann described Kermitops gratus as a new genus and species of amphibamiforms based on these fossil remains. The generic name, \"Kermitops\", combines a reference to Kermit the Frog—the famous amphibian character from the Muppets—with the Greek suffix \"-ops\", meaning face. The specific name, \"gratus\", means \"gratitude\" in Latin, honoring Nicholas Hotton III and the others who aided in collecting the holotype specimen.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nIn their 2024 description, So, Pardo & Mann performed multiple phylogenetic analyses; the fossil skull preserves an ossified element that may represent the basioccipital, and the coding of this character as \"present\" or \"absent\" altered their results. In their Bayesian inference analyses, Kermitops was consistently recovered as the sister taxon to Plemmyradytes. The cladogram with the basioccipital scored as \"present\" is displayed below:\n\n\n== References ==",

Qcne (talk) 21:40, 22 March 2024 (UTC)\n Comment: Blogs, wikis and photos are not reliable sources. S0091 (talk) 21:48, 21 March 2024 (UTC)\n\nColeraine Bridge, also known as the Coleraine Bann Bridge, Bann Bridge or Town Bridge, is a stone bridge, dating from 1844, in Coleraine, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It is the oldest of the three bridges that span the River Bann in Coleraine, the others being the Sandelford Bridge built 1975 to the south, and the Bann Bridge built 1924 to the north.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is a three arch stone bridge built between 1841 and 1844, designed by architect John Lynn, from designs held by the county surveyor Stewart Gordon and constructed by George Maxwell out of dressed Scottish granite. The bridge was opened in 1844 and is one of the finest stone-built bridges in Northern Ireland. The previous bridge was a stone and wooden structure which lasted between the 17th century to around 1840, the piers of said bridge can be seen under the arches at very low tide. Until the mid 1970s all the through traffic crossed the Coleraine Bridge causing serious congestion in the town until 1975 when the Sandelford Bridge which carries the A29 Ring Road opened.\nIn 2001 the Waterside Millenium Footbridge was constructed alongside the existing bridge on the downstream side for the added safety of pedestrians and cyclists as the old bridge was too narrow for footpaths on either side. It carries the A2 road across the Lower Bann River.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Christopher Langton (1521 – 1578) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLangton was born in 1521 at Riccall in Yorkshire, was educated on the foundation at Eton, and went as a scholar 23 August 1538 to King's College, Cambridge. He was admitted a fellow of King's College a week later than all the other scholars of his year, 2 September 1541, and graduated B.A. 1542. He received his last quarterage as a fellow at Cambridge at Christmas 1544, and in 1547 he describes himself as 'a lerner and as yet a yong student of physicke' (Dedication of Brefe Treatise), and in 1549 he was studying 'Galen de Usu partium.' His copy of the Paris edition of 1528, with his name, the date, and notes in his handwriting on several pages, is in the Cambridge University Library. He published, 10 April 1547, in London, 'A very Brefe Treatise, orderly declaring the Principal Partes of Plysick, that is to say, thynges natural, thynges not naturall, thynges agaynst nature,' with a dedication to Edward, duke of Somerset. He describes the ancient sects in physic, and then treats of anatomy, pathology, and therapeutics according to the method of his age. He commends Pliny, quotes Hippocrates, Ætius, Paulus Ægineta, Celsus and Galen, but of mediaeval writers only Avicenna. His English style is simple, and resembles that of More, being as full of idiomatic expressions, but much easier and more refined than that of the English treatises of the surgeons of his time. He shows a fair knowledge of Greek, and wrote a good Greek hand, as his copy of Galen proves. In 1550 published, through the same printer, 'Edward Whitchurch, of Flete Street, An Introduction into Phisycke, wyth a Universal Dyct.' It is dedicated to Sir Arthur Darcye, of whose favours he speaks, and begins with an address supposed to be spoken by Physic in person. Parts of it are mere alterations of his former treatise, and the additional matter is not important. He was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians of London on 30 Sept. 1552, having taken his M.D. degree at Cambridge, but was expelled for breach of the statutes and profligate conduct 17 July 1558, Dr. Caius being then president. On 16 June 1563, having been detected in an intrigue with two girls, he was punished by being carted to the Guildhall and through the city. Machyn (Diary, Camden Soc.), who saw him, describes his appearance in the cart. His professional ability must have been considerable, for in spite of this public disgrace he continued to have practice. Lord Monteagle gave him a pension, both Sir Thomas Smith and Sir Richard Gresham were his patients, and the latter left him a small legacy (will printed in Burgon, Life and Times of Sir T. Gresham, ii. 493). He published one other book, a 'Treatise of Urines, of all the Colours thereof, with the Medicines,' London, 1552. He died in 1578, and was buried in London at St. Botolph's Church, Bishopsgate.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1892). \"Langton, Christopher\".

        "content": "Introduction to Leadership Skills is the first level leadership development course for youth in the Boy Scouts of America.\n\n\n== Introduction to Leadership Skills for Crews ==\nIntroduction to Leadership Skills for Crews is the first level leadership development course for Venturers in the Boy Scouts of America's Venturing program for older youth (14–21). It replaced the Venturing Leadership Skills Course in 2014.  While the course is expected to be put on by a crew (ideally by the officers and adult advisors), many councils/districts put on ILSC courses (hopefully led mainly by experienced Venturers) for their Crews. This is done mainly because many crews are too small to effectively put on the course themselves.\n\n\n=== Format ===\nILSC helps crew members with leadership positions to learn about their new roles and how to most effectively reach success in that role. It is intended to help Venturers in leadership positions within their crew understand their responsibilities and to equip them with organizational and leadership skills.\nThe program is an introductory course that prepares participants to attend National Youth Leadership Training, National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience, and optionally Kodiak. The course is designed to be conducted in a retreat setting running from Friday evening through Saturday night. Some groups will offer a weekend version by adding such activities as Project COPE or more examples.\nThe ILSC course is divided into three modules:\nUnit Organization\nTools of the Trade\nLeadership and TeamworkOnce completed, Venturers are presented with a \"Trained\" strip patch, which is worn on their uniform, left sleeve, below their office patch (or where one will be). Even if the Venturer is not an officer, they still wear the patch.\nAfter completing ILSC, Venturers are encouraged to continue their leadership development by attending National Youth Leadership Training or a Kodiak leadership development trek. ILSC is considered the first stage of the overall Venturing youth leadership development program called Nature of Leadership.\n\n\n== Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops ==\nIntroduction to Leadership Skills for Troops (ILST) is a unit-level training program within the Boy Scouts of America led by the Scoutmaster and the Senior Patrol Leader. It is designed to improve the leadership skill of all boy leaders within a Boy Scout troop. This training is one of several programs available within the youth leadership training program.\n\n\n=== Program content ===\nIntroduction to Leadership Skills for Troops replaced Troop Leadership Training (TLT) in 2010. TLT was preceded by the Scoutmaster Junior Leader Training Kit (No. 3422) superscript 3, in use from 1990 to 2003.  TLT is broken into three one-hour modules. The three sessions focus respectively on what a new Patrol Leader or Senior Patrol Leader must know, must be, and must do. When a Scout completes all three modules, he is qualified to wear the \"Trained\" patch on his shirtsleeve under his badge of office. The manual contains leadership position cards that define each position in the troop. Completion of TLT prepares the youth to attend National Youth Leadership Training.The three one-hour modules are divided into three topics: It is organized into three one-hour modules, which can be taught individually or all in one session.\n\nModule One—Introduction to Leadership (Know) – Conducted within a week of a Scout's acceptance of his new position, this session focuses on what a boy leader must know. The manual directs the Scoutmaster to refer to the Scoutmaster Handbook, chapter 3, \"The Boy-Led Troop.\", and chapter 4. \"The Boy-Led Patrol.\"\nModule Two—How to Fulfill Your Role (Be) – This session on how to fulfill the role's responsibilities focuses on what a leader must be. The program includes the Scoutmaster's \"vision of success,\" a discussion of the \"Teaching EDGE\" method of instruction, and an evaluation of the troop's progress.\nModule Three—What Is Expected of Me? (Do) – This session focuses on what a leader must do. Topics include a review of the troop leader position descriptions, motivating Scouts to lead, what constitutes success in the boy's leadership role, and a coaching session with the Scoutmaster.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nScoutmaster's Junior Leader Training Kit. 1990.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 140 in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nHuffins was most likely settled in the 1870s. A post office was established at Huffins in 1881 and remained in operation until 1905. Mail was then sent to Viola after its closure. It was named for local landowner R.M. Huffines. Thus, both the town and his family were referred to as either Huffins or Huffines in local newspapers well into the 20th century. In 1884, the community had 50 residents served by a church, two cotton gins, and some saw and gristmills. The population went down to 35 in 1890. In 1983, Huffins had 90 residents served by a church, a cemetery, and a town hall. Its population went up to 140 in 2000.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHuffins is located at the intersection of Farm to Market Roads 251 and 1841, 8 mi (13 km) southeast of Atlanta in southeastern Cass County.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHuffins had its own school in 1884.

        "revision_id": 1215344910,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Friedman et al. v. Rogers et al., 440 U.S. 1 (1979) was a Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a Texas law, the Texas Optometry Act, which prohibited optometrists from using trade names for commercial purposes and which requires that 4/6 of the members of the Texas Optometry Board be members of the Texas Optometric Association is constitutional. In its decision the Supreme Court overruled the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas's ruling in that prohibition against trade name was an unnecessary and unjustified stifling of First Amendment Commercial speech. The decision further upheld a State's Tenth Amendment right to control and regulate their professional licensing boards and organizations.\n\n\n== Historical Context ==\nThroughout many industries and professional practices within the United States, there is a divide between those who consider themselves \"true professionals\" and those who are \"commercial professionals\". \"True professionals\" are against the use of commercial advertising or promotion, and \"commercial professionals\" are those who are for advertising. Dr. N. Jay. Rogers was a licensed optometrist in the State of Texas, and board member of the Texas Optometric Association, who was a staunch supporter of \"commercial professionals\", and was actually the lead spokesman for an organization of over 100 other commercial Optometric offices under the trade name of Texas State Optical. Rogers' complaint arose both the fact the Texas Optometry Act required 4/6 of the board members to be part of the Texas Optometric Association, which Rogers couldn't join due to his commercial affiliations, and that it prohibited the practice of optometry under a trade name.\n\n\n=== Lower Court ===\nRogers filed suit with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Beaumont Division. He filed suit against the rest of the board members, collectively represented by Dr. Richard Friedman, specifically he sued the Board to receive declaratory and injunctive relief from the enforcement of the specific parts of the statute at issue. The case was heard by an en banc panel of District Court Chief Judge Joseph Fisher, District Court Judge William Steger, and Fifth Circuit Judge Irving Goldberg presiding. In its memorandum opinion, the Court affirmed the part of the statute which required board members to be a part of the Texas Optometric Association, however it did side with Rogers in that the prohibition of using trade names was a violation of proper commercial speech protected by the First Amendment. saying,\"...even if a trade name is not an integral part of advertising per se, there is a first amendment right to the use of a trade name as part of the consuming public's right to valuable information.\"The District Court therefore struck down the specific section prohibiting trade names, and Friedman appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n== Supreme Court Decision ==\nOn November 8, 1978, the Supreme Court held oral arguments and its ruling was announced on February 21, 1979. In a unanimous decision the Court ruled in favor of Friedman, thereby affirming and reversing in part the District Court's decision, which ultimately meant Friedman had prevailed in the entire case. Although it was a unanimous decision in favor of Friedman, Justice Harry Blackmun, joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall, filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n=== Majority Opinion ===\nJustice Lewis Powell Jr. wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by every other Justice but those who dissented. The opinion reviewed the District Court's interpretation of two prior cases, those being Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350 (1977), and Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U. S. 748 (1976). In examining the District Court's decision, the Court concluded that the District Court had interpreted the cases wrongfully, stating,\"Here, we are concerned with a form of commercial speech that has no intrinsic meaning. A trade name conveys no information about the price and nature of the services offered by an optometrist until it acquires meaning over a period of time by associations formed in the minds of the public between the name and some standard of price or quality. Because these ill-defined associations of trade names with price and quality information can be manipulated by the users of trade names, there is a significant possibility that trade names will be used to mislead the public\" (footnote omitted)The Court found that although the use of trade names was commercial speech for its use in advertising, it found that,\"the State's interest in protecting the public from the deceptive and misleading use of optometrical trade names is substantial and..[w]e are convinced that § 5.13(d) is a constitutionally permissible state regulation in furtherance of this interest.\" It is's decision the Court did not emphasize the rule requiring membership in the Texas Optometrics Association very often, and really only mentioned it to affirm the District Court's decision on that part.\n\n\n=== Justice Blackmun's Concurrence/Dissent ===\nJustice Blackmun's Concurrence/Dissent opinion, joined by Justice Marshall, agreed with the majority in upholding the requirement of membership in the TOA, however it dissented in the bigger trade name issue. His argument is summed up by his stating that, \"This inescapable conclusion is one of profound importance in the measure of the First Amendment rights that are asserted here. It follows, it seems to me, that Texas has abridged the First Amendment rights not only of Doctor Rogers, but also of the members of the intervenor plaintiff Texas Senior Citizens Association by absolutely prohibiting, without reasonable justification, the dissemination of truthful information about wholly legal commercial conduct.\"Justice Blackmun's opinion in essence said the majority was over exaggerating any potential \"deception\" caused by the use of trade names, and that the Court had essentially silenced the lawful dissemination of information and advertising.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "James H. Baugh (February 6, 1832–August 15, 1891), born in Missouri, was a Colorado pioneer. In 1859, he followed the Pike's Peak Gold Rush to present-day Colorado, which was in Kansas Territory at the time and became Colorado Territory in 1861. Baugh homesteaded 160 acres near Clear Creek in present-day Wheat Ridge, Colorado where he operated a farm and an orchard. He built irrigation ditches from Clear Creek for his potato, oat, and wheat fields and orchard trees. Baugh was an active community member and political figure, which helped the town grow. Two of his homes, Pioneer Sod House and the James H. Baugh House, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nIn 1877, Baugh moved to Longmont, Colorado, where he continued to farm and married later in life. His daughter, Hattie, was born soon after he died.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJames H. Baugh, born in Missouri on February 6, 1832, was the son of Louisa and James F. Baugh, a farmer. He lived in St. Charles County, Missouri with his parents and siblings in 1850. Baugh was the oldest child on the 1850 census. His younger siblings were Julius C., Harvey S., Francis L., John B., Robert E. Baugh, Sarah, and Joseph.\n\n\n== Colorado pioneer ==\n\n\n=== Clear Creek Valley ===\n\nBaugh arrived in Denver on June 1, 1859, at the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek. He settled and began farming on August 15, 1859, .25 miles (0.40 km) from Clear Creek and along the Old Prospect Trail in present-day Wheat Ridge, Colorado. He was among the first settlers in the Clear Creek Valley of Kansas Territory, which became Colorado Territory in 1861. The Old Prospect Trail ran from Denver to Golden, Colorado and mining camps. \n\nBaugh built a log cabin in 1859 on a 160-acre parcel of homesteaded land. The cabin, which he expanded in 1877 and ca. 1892 to a Victorian farmhouse, is located at 44th Avenue and Robb Street. Baugh was a bachelor for many years. He hired laborers to work his farm.\nBaugh was politically active, influencing legislation and the community's growth. During his years in the Clear Creek Valley, he sat on a grand jury, was a petit juror, and led an effort to relocate a road. He also sat on the school board and was a delegate for Jefferson County to the 1868 State Democratic Convention.  Baugh spoke out against high taxation of farmers and high railroad taxes. He was a charter member of the local chapter of the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry. It was the first grange in Colorado Territory. He was a member of the Society of Colorado Pioneers. \n\nBaugh built what is called Pioneer Sod House between 1863 and 1870,  Since the sod house was built with tall prairie grass, it is likely that the house was built before 1864 when the prairie grass was gone.\nBaugh ran a farm and orchard on the land, using water from irrigation ditches from Clear Creek, and raised chickens. He grew potatoes, oats, wheat, and vegetables. He sold his produce in mining camps and Denver.\nBaugh was unable to pay property taxes in 1876 and he left the Wheat Ridge area in 1877 Also unable to pay the 1880 property taxes, the county treasurer put his farm up for sale to pay taxes. Baugh rented out his farm at that time. He subdivided his 160-acre parcel of land in 1888 and 1889 and sold the farmhouse in 1889 to Samuel Longenecker.\n\n\n=== Longmont ===\nBaugh moved to the Longmont, Colorado area in 1877. He lived in Weld County, Colorado in 1880. On December 22, 1889, Baugh married Mary J. Brown in Denver, and they lived on a farm near Longmont. Baugh died August 15, 1891, on his farm in Longmont. Mary gave birth to their daughter Hattie a few days after Baugh died in 1891. Hattie Baugh Gibson inherited her father's homestead parcels.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\"Baugh, James H., House, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form\" (PDF).

        "content": "K2-25 is a young red dwarf star located in the Hyades cluster. There is a single known Neptune-sized planet in a 3.5 day orbit.\n\n\n== Hyades cluster ==\nUsing proper motion measurements in a search for low-luminosity members of the Hyades cluster, William van Altena first identified the star vA 50 (later known as K2-25) as a probable cluster member. Membership in the Hyades cluster was later confirmed.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nK2-25 is a red dwarf that is only 26% the mass of the Sun and less than 1% of the luminosity. As a member of the Hyades cluster, it is only 650 million years old as compared to the Sun's 4.5 billion.There is clear evidence for starspot activity in both the Kepler data and radial velocities as well as the associated activity indicators.\n\n\n== Planetary system ==\nThe star has one known planet, K2-25b, with searches of the Kepler space telescope data for transits of additional planets being negative. Analysis of transit-timing variations from the Spitzer Space Telescope as well as the MEarth Project also found no evidence of additional planets.\n\n\n=== Discovery ===\nBrightness measurements of K2-25 taken by the Kepler space telescope during its extended K2 mission led to the discovery of the transiting planet K2-25b.\n\n\n=== Characteristics ===\nK2-25b is a Hot Neptune type planet in an eccentric 3.48 day orbit.Due to its proximity and the activity levels of its host star, K2-25b should be losing some of its atmosphere to space; however, observations of two transits by the Hubble Space Telescope to search for escaping neutral hydrogen were negative.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia  entry for K2-25b",

        "content": "Ladies First is a musical in three acts with music by A. Baldwin Sloane and both book and lyrics by Harry B. Smith. It was based on Charles H. Hoyt's 1897 play A Contented Woman. Directed by Frank Smithson and produced by Harry Frazee, it premiered at Broadway's Broadhurst Theatre on October 24, 1918. In the middle of its New York run it transferred to the Nora Bayes Theatre where it closed on March 15, 1919, after 164 performances.\nLadies First was created as a starring vehicle for Nora Bayes who played the role of Betty Burt. It was originally titled Look Who's Here during tryout performances prior to its Broadway run. The musical included two interpolated songs by George Gershwin as the composer: \"The Real American Folk Song (is a Rag)\" (lyricist Ira Gershwin under the pseudonym Arthur Francis) and \"Some Wonderful Sort of Someone\" (lyricist Shuyler Greene).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n​Ladies First​ at the Internet Broadway Database",

This potential leprous origin as well as their treatment, until the eighteenth century, mean they are often compared to the Cagots of southwestern France and northern Spain, or the crétins des Alpes of the Swiss Alps, there is however no mention of physical or mental particularities specific to the Caquins.\n\n\n== Legal restrictions ==\nThe Caquins were subjected to a variety of laws restricting their actions in society, this included restricting what work they could undertake, any while they could own land they were prohibited from building.\nOn 12 February 1425, John V, Duke of Brittany in his constitutions forbade the Caquins to engage in trade and demanded their separation from others. However, on 16 April 1447, the duke allowed the Caquins to take leased land in the bishopric of Vannes, as well as elsewhere.\nOn 18 December 1456, Peter II, Duke of Brittany, issued a long ordinance on fouages (the tax paid by each feu), where he declared that the Caquins were exempted from this tax.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

        "content": "The Coronets were a British vocal group active in the mid-1950s.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe group was formed in June 1953 by Bill Shepherd and Valerie Tyler, who were both members of the George Mitchell Minstrels at the time, and who hit upon the idea for a new group while on a train from Birmingham to London.  The inspiration for the group's name was the Coronation and they commissioned a quintet of coronets for wearing in performance.\nThe group's break came when they were featured for four months on the Midday Music Hall radio programme towards the end of 1953, making their television debut in October on the Shop Window programme, and were invited to provide a song for a Goons film.\nThe Coronets were mostly back-up singers on the Columbia label, and performed on cheap budget label cover versions, but did record a number of singles under their own name.  One of them - \"Brown Eyes - Why Are You Blue?\" - saw the group record each vocal part twice, to make a 10-part harmony.\nOriginal bass singer Gerry Laine was replaced by Mike Sammes in 1954.  In September 1955, Marion Gay had to step away from the group, as she was pregnant; Irene King was recruited from The Keynotes as a replacement.\nBy 1957, Sammes was more interested in American harmonies and a more contemporary sound, and formed the Mike Sammes Singers, and Shepherd had become the musical director at Pye Nixa; as a result the Coronets ceased to exist.   Shepherd managed a varying line-up known as \"the Coronet Singers\", which later became known simply as the Bill Shepherd Singers.\nThe group had two singles which made the New Musical Express singles charts, both in 1955; one single which did not make the NME charts, \"Don't Go To Strangers\", backing Ronnie Harris, was at number 9 in the first Record Mirror chart on 22 January 1955, and peaked at 8 a week later.\n\n\n== Charting singles ==\nDon't Go To Strangers (Ronnie Harris with the Coronets): Record Mirror no. 8, January 1955\nThat's How A Love Song Was Born (Ray Burns with the Coronets): NME no. 14, August 1955\nTwenty Tiny Fingers: NME no. 20=, November 1955\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Izz al-Din al-Kawrani (Egyptian Arabic: عز الدين الكَوْراني) was an Egyptian politician and military leader, and one of the leaders of the campaign to invade Makuria (Nubia) in 1287 by order of Sultan Qalawun of Egypt. His campaign achieved a landslide victory, and this victory is one of the reasons for the end of the rule of the Christian Nubian kingdoms in Sudan.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nHe comes from the al-Kawrani family, which is an Egyptian family that follows the Shafi'i school. Al-Kawrani means “Kawar | كور,” and “Kawar” is a geographical term that refers to the people of villages in Egypt, and some suggest that Izz al-Din is originally from the villages of Upper Egypt.\nA number of political and military figures appeared from this family during the reign of the Qalawunid dynasty, the most prominent of whom was Alaa al-Din Ali bin al-Kawrani, who was the governor (wali) of Gharbia, then became the governor of Cairo in the year 764 AH, and his son Husam al-Din Hassan bin Alaa al-Din Ali bin Mamdoud al-Kawrani, who became the governor of Menoufia in the year 765 AH. In the year 768 AH, he became governor of Cairo, put down the rebellions in the Levant, and attained the highest military rank in the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate, which was Muqadam Alaf.\n\n\n== Conquest of Makuria ==\n\nOn the 6th of Dhu al-Hijja of the year 686 AH, emir Alam al-Din Sanjar al-Masrouri, known as al-Khayyat, governor of Cairo, emir Izz al-Din al-Kawrani, and emir Izz al-Din Aidmar headed to invade Nubia. Sultan Qalawun sent with them a group of soldiers from the provinces of Upper Egypt and al-Qaragholamiya, and wrote to emir Izz al-Din Aidmar al-Sayfi al-Selahdar, the governor of Qus, to march with them with his equipment and those of the Royal Mamluks with him who are centered in the al-a'mal al-Qusyia and the soldiers of the markaz Qus (Qus center).\nAl-Khayyat marched on the western coast with half of the army, and Aidmar marched on the second half of the eastern shore, which is the side in which the city of Dongola (the capital of the Kingdom of Makuria) is located. When the army reached the outskirts of Nubia, the king of Makuria, Samamoun, evacuated the country. He was clever and cunning, and he was powerful.\nSamamoun sent a letter to his deputy, whose name was Jiris, and the owner of this state was known in Makuria as the owner of the mountain (Sahib al-Jabal), ordering him to evacuate the lands under his hand in front of the advancing army, and they (Makurians) kept leaving, with the Egyptian soldiers behind them, until they reached the king of Makuria at Dongola, and Samamoun came out and fought emir Izz al-Din Aidmar fiercely, and the king of Makuria was defeated and many of those with him were killed, and several Muslims were martyred.\nThe Egyptian army followed the king of Makuria on a fifteen-day march from Dongola until they overtook Jiris and captured him. They also captured the king’s cousin, who was one of their greats, so emir Izz al-Din appointed the king’s sister’s son to the kingdom of Makuria and appointed Jiris as his deputy. He sent soldiers with them and assigned them a piece of land that they would carry every year, and he returned with spoils, including many slaves, horses, camels, cows, and livestock.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is believed that it had been installed remotely.\nThe SPI flash memory on the motherboard is the implanting location. CORE_DXE is the firmware laced component which is used during the first phases of the UEFI boot sequence. It hooks EFI Boot Services functions and inject more malware into a svchost.exe process during boot.\nIt resides on a low level portion of the hard drive. It operates in memory only which makes it undetectable on the HDD.\n\n\n== References ==",

As the population of Leeds grew, the grounds and graveyard were split from the church and divided up by roads and railway lines. Although it has been converted into a public park, the gravestones have been kept to adorn the slopes of the railway lines that bisect the land.\nIn 1912 part of Penny Pocket Park became the responsibility of Wade's Charity (formally Thomas Wade Trust), who retain ownership, though it is leased to and maintained by Leeds City Council.\n\n\n== References ==",

It has been referred to by NASA and other space agencies as hosting an active galactic nucleus, a quasar, and a Seyfert galaxy, each of which overlap in some way. Z-229-15 has a supermassive black hole at its core, giving it high levels of luminosity. Z 229-15 matter gets so hot that it releases a large amount of energy across the electromagnetic spectrum on a regular basis.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nZ 229-15's classification has been up for speculation for many years. Z 229-15 has been widely called a quasar, and if this is true would make Z 229-15 positively local. Many space agencies, notably NASA, have called it a Seyfert galaxy that contains a quasar, and that, by definition, hosts an active galactic nuclei. This would make Z 229-15 a very uncommon galaxy in scientific terms.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Dulcineia Catarina Moura de Sousa Coito (born 20 September 1980) is a Portuguese professor teaching at the Higher Institute of Business and Tourism (ISCET) in Porto. She has a PhD in economics from the University of Beira Interior, where she is a researcher at the Research Centre in Business Sciences (NECE). In March 2024 she was elected to the Portuguese parliament as a representative of the Democratic Alliance for the Guarda District.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMoura was born on 20 September 1980. She obtained a post-graduate degree in territorial marketing and a PhD in economics from the University of Beira Interior. Her doctorate thesis was titled \"Determining factors of innovative performance in Portuguese companies: cooperation, absorptive capacity and public policies\" and aimed to better understand whether firm cooperation and absorptive capacity foster success in seeking public financial support for innovation activities and, by doing so, how they contribute to innovation output. She concluded that as the level of absorptive capacity in Portuguese firms increases, so the demand for public financial support from the European Union to stimulate innovation also increases. \n\n\n== Career ==\nMoura is a researcher as a member of the Scientific Council of the NECE – Research Centre in Business Sciences (at the University of Beira Interior). Her professional career has concentrated on regional development, tourism promotion and cross-border cooperation projects. She is the executive coordinator of Território do Côa - Associação de Desenvolvimento Regional, which promotes tourism to the Côa River valley of Portugal. Moura is also a higher education teacher at ISCET in Porto, and also works as a business consultant and as a guest speaker to regional and tourist promotion initiatives, with the aim of promoting innovation and fostering entrepreneurial skills. She is the author or co-author of several books and regularly contributes articles to local and regional newspapers in the Guarda area.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nMoura is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Portugal (PSD), in which capacity she became a deputy in the municipal assembly of Guarda and represented Guarda in the Assembly of the intermunicipal community of the Beiras e Serra da Estrela. In January 2024 she was chosen as head of the Democratic Alliance (AD) list of candidates for the three seats in the Assembly of the Republic allocated to the Guarda District. Despite the AD winning over one-third of the votes in the constituency, she was the only representative of the Alliance to be elected. Her campaign had focused on a mix of national and local issues. \n\n\n== References ==",

        "revision_id": 1219881461,
        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "The Horns of Moses are an iconographic convention common in Latin Christianity whereby Moses was commonly presented as having two horns on his head, later replaced by rays of light. The idea comes from a translation, or mis-translation, of a Hebrew term in Jerome's Latin Vulgate Bible, and many later vernacular translations dependent on that. Moses is said to be \"horned\", or radiant, or glorified, after he sees God who presents him with the tablets of the law in the Book of Exodus. The use of the term \"horned\" to describe Moses in fact predates Jerome, and can be traced to the Greek Jewish scholar Aquila of Sinope, whose Greek translations were well known to Jerome. The Hebrew qāran' may reflect an allegorical concept of \"glorified\", or rings of light. Horns tend to have positive associations in the Old Testament, and in ancient middle eastern culture more widely, but are associated with negative forces in the Book of Revelation in the New Testament.  These considerations may have influenced the translators in their choices, for Aquila as a positive, or for Jerome, as a negative.\nMoses with horns probably first appears in visual depictions in the eleventh century. These portrayals continue to compete with unhorned depictions of Moses through the medieval and Renaissance periods. Many are clearly positive depictions, as a prophet and precursor to Jesus. Other depictions of Moses, horned and unhorned, are likely to have had antisemitic connotations, especially in the later medieval period, for example, on the Hereford Mappa Mundi. Associations between Jews and devils were established, and a belief that Jews possessed horns developed, including through the badges or hats featuring horns they were mandated to wear; it may have been hard for the images of a horned Moses and the \"horned\" Jew to have been kept apart in the popular imagination. Horned Moses iconography may also have reinforced the idea that Jews have horns.\nMichelangelo's horned Moses of c.1513–1515 comes at the end of the tradition of this depiction, and is generally seen as a positive depiction of the prophet, if containing an animalistic or demotic element. Awareness of flaws in the Vulgate translation spread in the later Middle Ages, and by about 1500 it was realized in scholarly circles that \"horned\" was a mistranslation. Horns were often replaced by two bunches of rays of light, springing from the same parts of the head, as seen in the 1481–1482 Moses frescoes in the Sistine Chapel or on the 1544 Mosesbrunnen fountain in Bern, Switzerland. These remained common until the 19th century. Artists often ignored the idea that Moses' rays were given to him when he received the tablets of the law, and by the 19th century some images of the infant Moses in scenes of the Finding of Moses and Moses in the Bullrushes feature the rays. \n\n\n== Etymological origin ==\nDepictions of a horned Moses stem from the description of Moses' face as \"cornuta\" (\"horned\") in the Latin Vulgate translation of the passage found at Exodus chapter 34, specifically verses 29, 30 and 35, in which Moses returns to the people after receiving the commandments for the second time. The Catholic Douay–Rheims Bible (1609) translates the Vulgate as, \"And when Moses came down from the Mount Sinai, he held the two tables of the testimony, and he knew not that his face was horned from the conversation of the Lord.\" This was Jerome's effort to faithfully translate the difficult, original Hebrew text, which uses the term קָרַן‎, qāran (based on the root, קֶרֶן‎ qeren, which often means \"horn\"); the term is now interpreted to mean \"shining\" or \"emitting rays\" (somewhat like horns).  The Anglican King James or Authorised Version of only a few years later has no horns, but a shining face \"… when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him\". \n\n The usual view in recent centuries has been that Jerome made an outright error, but it has recently been argued that Jerome regarded qeren as a metaphor for \"glorified\", based on other commentaries he wrote, including one on Ezekiel, where he wrote that Moses' face had \"become 'glorified', or as it says in the Hebrew, 'horned'.\" The use of the term \"horned\" in fact predates Jerome, and was contained in existing translations he is known to have worked with, especially that of Aquila from Hebrew to Greek; other translations used included the alternative \"glorified\". Medjuck argues that \"horned\" is a metaphorical or allegorical concept relating to glory in both Jerome's translation and Jewish tradition, which Jerome was familiar with. Another interpretation was that qeren also represented 'rings of light' as when Moses became enlightened after his journey. The Greek Septuagint, which Jerome also had available, translated the verse as \"Moses knew not that the appearance of the skin of his face was glorified.\" Medieval theologians and scholars believed that Jerome had intended to express a glorification of Moses' face, by his use of the Latin word for \"horned.\" The understanding that the original Hebrew was difficult and was not likely to actually mean \"horns\" developed during the Renaissance.\nCultural historian Stephen Bertman argues that Jerome is known himself to have held antisemitic views, and may have made the choice to associate Moses with \"horns\" consciously for theological reasons. Bertman argues that for Aquila, as a Jew, \"horns\" as presented in the Old Testament, would have generally positive associations, but that Jerome could have expected his readers to have in mind the New Testament association of horns with dragons, wild beasts and the antichrist in Revelations. Given that Moses was the holder of the old, now replaced, law, it may have been preferable to Jerome to portray him in a negative light. Furthermore, implying that Moses' face was \"glorified\" would imply an association with Jesus, and place the Old Law on a parallel with the new. Thus Bertman concludes Jerome may simply have been acting on his own biases and theological preferences.\n\n\n== In medieval art ==\nAlthough Jerome completed the Vulgate in the late 4th century, it is usually said that the first known applications in art of the literal language of the Vulgate on this point are found in numerous images in the Old English Hexateuch (British Library, Cotton MS Claudius B.iv.) a heavily illustrated manuscript of the Old English translation made before about 1050. Mellinkoff argues that English art of this period was innovative, so new a interpretation and depiction of Moses would be in keeping with other new ideas found from the period. She also argues that it is important that the depiction occurs in a vernacular text, as it is a literal depiction of the Old English translation, gehyrned, or \"horned\", and that Old English artists were not \"scholarly\", that is they were not necessariy familiar with scholarly traditions that may have led them to depict Moses differently. However, it has often been suggested that the pictures in this are derived from a much earlier manuscript then in Canterbury, and now lost.  Herbert Broderick, in a monograph on the illustrations in the manuscript suggests that this ancient prototype had illustrations drawing on ideas about charismatic leadership current in Hellenistic Egypt, and the horns were in these images, as horns of power and holiness.\nFor the next century or so, evidence for further images of a horned Moses is sparse, although surviving images of him are generally few.  Around 1120 he reappears in English manuscripts such as the Bury Bible and Shaftesbury Psalter, as well as an Austrian bible.  These early images respect the timing of the change in Moses' appearance, showing him without horns before he comes down Mount Sinai.  Afterwards, such images proliferated and can be found, for example, in the stained glass windows at Chartres Cathedral, the Sainte-Chapelle, and Notre Dame Cathedral, even as Moses continued to be depicted many times without horns. \n\n In the Christian art of the Middle Ages depicting Moses with horns, this is sometimes done to depict him in glory, as a prophet and precursor of Jesus, but also in negative contexts, especially about Pauline contrasts between faith and law; the iconography was not clear-cut. Art historian Debra Strickland identifies the horned Moses on the Hereford Mappa Mundi as an overtly antisemitic example, which she argues is associated with the redefining the Exodus story as a defence of the 1290 Expulsion of the Jews from England. Sometimes Moses appears in a negative context with or instead of the figure of Synagoga.\nArt historian Ruth Mellinkoff speculated that while the horns of Moses in origin were in no way associated with those of the Devil, the horns may nevertheless have developed a negative connotation with the development of anti-Jewish sentiment in the later medieval period.  Bertman agrees that the medieval perception of Moses with horns would have acted to create associations between Moses and devils. Associations between Jews and devils in Christian antisemitic imagery were strong, and Jews were sometimes portrayed as having horns. The Jewish hats mandated in France and elsewhere, were known as the pileus cornutus (horned hat) and the badges enforced by Phillip III of France seem to have incorporated a horn. It is also possible that Moses' horned figure served as a means to reinforce the belief that Jews had horns. In any case, such associations in the popular imagination would, in Bertman, Mellinkoff and Strickland's view, have overriden theological or other concerns. In the end, Moses was a Jew, could be associated with contemporary counterparts, and the same negative ideas could be applied to both.\nReligious plays functioned as an important means for theological ideas to be disseminated. Stage depictions of Moses may have commonly featured him with horns. Although stage directions for him to be horned are found in only one preserved play, it may also be that it was such a normal expectation that it would have been considered unnecessary to state; and stage directions themselves are relatively uncommon. The most commonly known plays to feature Moses are based on Augustine's text Contra Judaeos, Paganos,\net Arianos Sermo de Symbolo (Sermon on the Creed against the Jews, Pagans and Arians) in which Moses and other Old Testament prophets serve as witnesses to persuade Jews of their error in persisting with their beliefs.\n\n\n== Renaissance and later art ==\n The most well-known interpretation of Moses with horns dates to this time, in Michelangelo's Moses. Its qualities have been extensively discussed, including by Sigmund Freud. The figure is usually viewed in broadly positive terms, while containing a demotic element. Art historian Jennifer Koosed has argued that the statue is the culmination of the horned Moses tradition, mixing animal and human qualities to present the divine.\nBy the 16th century, the prevalence of depictions of a horned Moses steeply diminished.  As Renaissance Biblical scholarship developed, awareness that \"horned\" was a mistranslation gradually spread, and the horns were dropped in art, often replaced by two bunches of rays of light, springing from the same parts of the head, Moses is depicted numerous times in the Life of Moses fresco cycle in the Sistine Chapel of 1481-82, all without horns, but in the last three scenes, after he receives the Commandments, he is given rays of light; the Descent from Mount Sinai is the first of these. \nThe Staff of Moses, which is first mentioned in the Bible during the account of the Burning bush episode, and in iconic settings the tablets with the commandments, become his usual attributes with or without the rays or horns, and together with an imposing figure and long white beard, usually make him recognisable even in crowded scenes. Another well known example is the 1544 statue on the Mosesbrunnen fountain in Bern, Switzerland, with the rays of light added in gilded metal.  The presentation of Moses with rays of light reflected the usual view in rabbinical literature by this time.\nThe presentation of Moses with rays of light remained common until the 19th century, for example appearing in the Bible illustrations of Gustave Doré (1866). The Bible says that Moses' appearance had changed when he returned from his lengthy encounter with God on Mount Sinai, a change represented in art by the \"horns\" or rays.  Logically, in narrative images  he should only have been shown with these visible from this point in his life onwards, but artists did not always follow this and he is often shown with them in earlier episodes.  By the 19th century some images of the infant Moses in scenes of the Finding of Moses and Moses in the Bullrushes show the rays (an idea with support from the Midrash).\nA rather late horned Moses is the statue by Charles Henry Niehaus in the hall of the Library of Congress in Washington D.C..\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMoses (Michelangelo)\nHereford Mappa Mundi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Secondary sources ==\n\n\n== Primary sources ==",

        "content": "The chief minister of the  National Capital Territory of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, was arrested on 21 March 2024 around 09:00 pm IST after not responding to nine summons from the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the Delhi liquor policy money laundering case, becoming the first sitting chief minister in Indian history to be arrested.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn June 2022, a batch of complaints alleging a “multi-crore scam” in the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy, one of which was filed with the Delhi Police  by former Delhi Congress president Anil Kumar  Chaudhary.\nKejriwal and his allies had been accused by political rivals, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), of selling liquor licences and receiving kickbacks from private vendors. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had alleged that it had evidence of AAP receiving millions of dollars from a liquor group. Several high-ranking members of the AAP had previously been arrested in connection with the scam, including Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia in March 2023.\n\n\n== Arrest ==\nKejriwal was arrested on 21 March 2024 following a raid on his home by the Enforcement Directorate. As he was being taken away, supporters and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers were protesting outside his residence. Kejriwal was arrested just after release of Electroal bond data, which linked Bharatiya Janata Party took  protection money of worth 60 crore from the alleged liquor Scam kingpin Sarath Chandra Reddy's Aurobindo Pharma Limited. Kejriwal was remanded until 28 March 2024, and remains in the custody of the Enforcement Directorate (ED). He had skipped nine summons from the ED before that. The Delhi High Court dismissed Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's petition against his arrest.\n\n\n== Reaction ==\n\n\n=== Domestic ===\nThe arrest caused numerous protests in Delhi on 26 March 2024, with AAP supporters marching to the Prime Minister's residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg while BJP supporters demanding Kejriwal's resignation marched to the Secretariat Building, New Delhi.\nDelhi Cabinet Minister Raaj Kumar Anand resigned as minister of social welfare and also tendered his resignation from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He said that did not want his name to be associated with “corruption” after Delhi High Court's rejection of Kejriwal's bail.\nProminent opposition leaders have voiced strong opposition to Kejriwal's arrest, framing it as part of a broader authoritarian trend under the current government. Rahul Gandhi, for instance, described the government's actions as those of a \"scared dictator\" aiming to create a \"dead democracy.\"\n\n\n=== International ===\n United Nations:\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said We very much hope that in India, as in any country that is having elections, that everyone's rights are protected, including political and civil rights, and everyone is able to vote in an atmosphere that is free and fair.\n United States:\nUnited States Department of State spokesperson Matthew Miller said, \"We continue to follow these actions closely, including the arrest of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. We are also aware of the Congress party's allegations that tax authorities have frozen some of their bank accounts in a manner that will make it challenging to effectively campaign in the upcoming elections.\" A spokesperson for the United States Department of State said that the US was closely following reports of Kejriwal's arrest and that they \"encourage a fair, transparent, and timely legal process for Chief Minister Kejriwal\".\nIn response, Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that India's legal processes were \"based on an independent judiciary\" and that they were \"committed to objective and timely outcomes.\"\n Germany:\nA spokesperson for the German Federal Foreign Office said Germany \"takes note\" of Kejriwal's arrest and expected that the \"standards relating to independence of judiciary and basic democratic principles\" will also apply to this case.\nIn response, the MEA said that the remarks were seen as \"interfering in our judicial process\" and \"undermining the independence of our judiciary\".\nAmnesty International, an international human rights group said that the arrest of Kejriwal and the \"freezing of Indian National Congress’ bank accounts\", a few weeks before India's general elections showed \"the authorities’ blatant failure to uphold the country’s international human rights obligations\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nDelhi liquor scam\nList of scandals in India\n\n\n== References ==",

He served in this postion while concurrently running for Mayor of Campinas in 2016 and Federal Deputy in 2018.\nPochmann held the role until 2020 when he was replaced by former senator Aloizio Mercadante.\n\n\n=== Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ===\nIn July 2023, he was appointed to preside over the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\n\n==== Controversy over appointment ====\nAccording to some journalists, the choice of Pochmann caused discomfort among the team at the Ministry of Planning and Budget, who had perfered a technocratic rather than political appointement, like that of Luciana Servo at IPEA.\nControversies emerged between Tebet and Lula over the nomination, as Tebet was not consulted. Tebet said in a statement that \"Minister Pimenta, not knowing that in the meeting we had with the president we had not mentioned the name, announced it preliminarily. And it has already been placed. The name will be made official at the right time, after the conversation we will have next week with President Lula . We will accept any name that comes.\"\nThe Buenos Aires Times reported that Pochmann’s leftist economic views are considered \"too extreme even by members of Lula’s economic team, who worry about damage to IBGE’s credibility...after Pochmann’s years at IPEA, [which] were controversial and caused several economists who did not agree with him to leave the organisation.\"\n\n\n==== Tenure ====\nIn August 2023, with a ceremony at the ministry's headquarters in Brasília, he assumed the presidency of IBGE.\nIn November, Pochmann said in a lecture to employees that he intended to change the research dissemination model, not going through press conferences by the mainstream media.\n\n\n== Elections ==\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Awards ===\n\n\n=== Works ===\nHaving published over 50 books, Boitempo Editorial noted these works:\n\nO emprego na globalização (2001)\nO emprego no desenvolvimento da nação (2008)\nMargem Esquerda n°15 (2010)\nNova classe média?

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 50 in 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area in what is known as Gum Springs today was first settled as early as 1850 due to the hot springs in the area. These, along with the gum trees in the area, gave the community its name. It was a shipping point for farmers and had two churches in the 1930s, alongside many farms. Only one church and a cemetery remained in the 1980s and the population was recorded as 50 in 2000.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nGum Springs is located on Texas State Highway 8, 9 mi (14 km) north of Linden in north-central Cass County.\n\n\n== Education ==\nGum Springs had a school for African Americans in the 1930s. Today, the community is served by the Linden-Kildare Consolidated Independent School District.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Sophisticated Abbey: Live at the Keystone Korner is a live album by jazz vocalist Abbey Lincoln. It was recorded during March 1980 at the Keystone Korner in San Francisco, California, and was released in 2015 by HighNote Records. On the album, Lincoln is joined by pianist Phil Wright, double bassist James Leary, and drummer Doug Sides.\nAnother recording from the same engagement, titled Love Having You Around: Live at the Keystone Korner Vol. 2, was released by HighNote in 2016.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIn a review for Jazzwise, Kevin Le Gendre wrote: \"In this centenary year of Billie Holiday's birth, the release of a concert performance that brings any kind of attention to Lincoln, the singer who upheld her spirit perhaps more than anyone, is welcome... None of her sidemen are really 'name' players yet they provide simpatico and sensitive support, responding well to her leisurely time for the most part, and swinging without excess bluster.\"\nAnders Griffen of The New York City Jazz Record described the album as \"an outstanding set,\" and stated: \"This appearance at Keystone Korner marks the beginning of Lincoln's music reclaiming the vanguard of her livelihood... the whole group... displays tremendous rapport... With great live sound in an intimate setting, a nuanced program and a killing band, this is truly an unearthed gem.\"\nDusted Magazine's Derek Taylor noted that the album finds Lincoln \"regaling a receptive audience and adopting the after-hours chanteuse style of her greatest influence, Billie Holiday,\" and commented: \"The music here works as a decent placeholder of where she was prior, plying her trade on the small stage to commensurate applause with nothing to prove and a legacy already secure.\"\nWriting for Audiophile Audition, John Sunier remarked: \"In this somewhat eclectic session, Abbey runs through a set list of original material, standards, and songs that appear to have a close association with her causes. Backed by a sympathetic trio, she sings and talks her way with warmth and intimacy through the numbers... This is a welcomed addition to the Abbey Lincoln discography.\"\nThe editors of NPR Music included the album in their list of best historical releases of 2015, as did David Johnson of Indiana Public Media.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Painted Lady\" (Abbey Lincoln) – 5:32\n\"Long as You're Living\" (Julian Priester, Tommy Turrentine, Oscar Brown, Jr.) – 4:30\n\"Spoken Introduction\" – 0:24\n\"Somos Novios (It's Impossible)\" (Armando Manzanero) – 5:15\n\"Sophisticated Lady\" (Duke Ellington, Mitchell Parish, Irving Mills) / \"There Are Such Things\" (Stanley Adams, George W. Meyer, Abel Baer) / \"Con Alma\" (Dizzy Gillespie, Abbey Lincoln) – 9:58\n\"Whistling Away the Dark\" (Henry Mancini, Johnny Mercer) – 4:59\n\"Spoken Introduction\" – 0:40\n\"People In Me\" (Abbey Lincoln) – 5:29\n\"The Nearness of You\" (Hoagy Carmichael, Ned Washington) / \"For All We Know\" (J. Fred Coots, Sam M. Lewis) – 6:14\n\"Golden Lady\" (Stevie Wonder) – 4:42\n\"God Bless the Child\" (Billie Holiday, Arthur Herzog Jr.) – 6:23\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAbbey Lincoln – vocals\nPhil Wright – piano\nJames Leary – double bass\nDoug Sides – drums\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Janetta R. FitzHugh (April 16, 1866 – May 16, 1950) was a women's suffragette. She was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where she helped to found the Fredericksburg Civic Betterment Club in 1911 and was elected president. Her early work with the club focused on sanitation and public health. She was better known, however, for her work in the suffragette movement.\n\n\n== Suffragette movement ==\nBy 1911, FitzHugh expanded her work into the suffragette movement. That year, she and her friend, the novelist and suffragist Mary Johnston, donated several books on hygiene and morality to the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia's library. The following year, she was elected president of the new Equal Suffrage League chapter in Fredericksburg. She held the office until the passage of the 20th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which allowed women to vote. Under her leadership, membership grew from about two dozen to several hundred by 1918. The Library of Virginia has digitized many records related to the Equal Suffrage League.\nShe attended the National American Woman Suffrage Association's conventions as a Virginia delegate in 1912, 1914, and 1917. In 1913, she attended the Woman Suffrage Procession in Washington, DC, as a Virginia delegate. In 1915, Janetta and several other women asked Virginia Governor Henry Carter Stuart at his office for a women's suffrage bill that stalled in the state legislature. The bill passed.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nIn 1920, FitzHugh helped organize the Virginia League of Women Voters. Janetta did not marry and lived with her family. She died of cancer in Fredericksburg in 1950.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Muhamet Pirraku (1944–2014), was Albanian historian and publicist from Kosovo.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPirraku was born on October 12, 1944, in Flamuras, Drenas. Pirraku completed his elementary education in Flamuras and Komoran, secondary education in Drenas. He pursued higher education at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Prishtina, specializing in History. Subsequently, he earned his master's degree from the University of Zagreb in 1976. Pirraku obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Prishtina in 1988, focusing on “Albanian Culture from the 18th Century to 1878.”\nEngaged in political activities advocating for Kosovo's self-determination and Albanian unity, Pirraku was associated with the intellectual group “Çeta e Bajo e Çerçiz Topulli.” Despite facing political challenges, he continued to disseminate literature, philosophy, and historical works within Albania and among the Albanian diaspora in Europe and the United States.\nPirraku faced restrictions on publishing and scholarly activities due to his political views. He endured bans and obstacles for over 15 years, including a decade of complete prohibition. From August 1981 to August 1982, he was imprisoned in various detention centers in Pristina, Mitrovica, and Sarajevo, during which his handwritten historical notes, scientific papers, diaries, and poetry were confiscated.\nDespite challenges, Pirraku pursued creative endeavors, working as a skilled mason and designer in the early 1980s. He continued contributing to political and historical discourse, leaving a lasting impact on Albanian intellectual life. His legacy includes numerous anonymous publications, studies, and two significant works dedicated to Isa Boletini and Hasan Prishtina. Muhamet Pirraku's dedication to preserving Albanian heritage and advancing historical knowledge remains evident in his enduring influence and commitment.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nKultura Kombëtare Shqiptare deri në Lidhjen e Prizrenit (Albanian National Culture up to the League of Prizren) Prishtinë, 1989, OCLC 21409391\n Ripushtimi jugosllav i Kosovës 1945 (Yugoslav Reoccupation of Kosovo 1945), Prishtinë, 1992,\nKalvari i shqiptarësisë së Kosovës (The Calvary of Albanianism in Kosovo), Tivari 1945, Prishtinë, 1993,\nMulla Idris Gjilani dhe Mbrojtja Kombëtare e Kosovës Lindore 1941- 1951 (Mulla Idris Gjilani and the National Defense of Eastern Kosovo 1941-1951), Prishtinë, 1995, OCLC 51215098\nFeja, kultura dhe tradita islame ndër shqiptarët (Religion, Culture, and Islamic Tradition among Albanians) (coauthor & editor), Prishtinë, 1995,\n Lëvizja Gjithëpopullore Shqiptare për Faljen e Gjaqeve 1990-1992.

        "content": "\n== Definition of Terrorism ==\nAccording to the Terrorism Act 2000, terrorism is “… the use or threat of action… designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public or a section of the public… and is made to advance political, religious, racial, or ideological cause…\" which must “… involve serious violence against a person, damage to property, endangers life, creates a risk to health, and is designed to interfere with an electronic system.”The Terrorism Act does not set out a strict definition of Extreme Right-Wing (ERW) terrorism. However, Protect UK, a national counter-terrorism security office, states that this type of violence involves \"those involved in ERW activity use violence in furtherance of their ideology\" and \"represent a cohesive body, rather than a fragmented movement made up of groups and individuals with a range of ideologies.”According to the British Parliament, key ideologies of extreme right-wing terrorism are white supremacy, cultural nationalism, and the identarian movement, while key targets include non-white ethnic and religious groups, the LGBTQ+ community, and politicians and public figures.\n\n\n== 20th century ==\nERW groups have been a recurring phenomenon in the United Kingdom since the early 20th century. One of the earliest examples of Fascism in the UK can be found as early as 1923 with the formation of British Fascisti by Rotha Lintorn-Orman.After the emergence of British Fascisti, it was not until 1932, when Oswald Mosley, who held traditional British values, founded the British Union of Fascists(BUF) and later the Union Movement, that ERW groups started to become more prevalent. Mosley believed that fascism was the only possible way to save Britain from socio-economic ruin and a communist takeover.\n\n\n=== 1950-60s ===\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, the landscape of ERW groups continued to evolve with the emergence of organisations such as the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL) and the National Front (NF). The rise of ERW ideologies during this period can be attributed, in part, to the dismantling of the British Empire, due to a sense of national decline.The LEL, founded by A.K. Chesterton in 1954, believed that Jews were behind the dismantling of the British empire, which they saw as the national \"pride and joy.\" They aimed to “force upon existing parties favourable to national and imperial survival”  and hoped to see a return of the “British world… at home and abroad.” Throughout its time, LEL was involved in many non-violent protests, which involved heckling speakers.National Front\nThe NF, which was founded in 1967, by Chesterton, through the merging of the LEL and the British National Front and capitalised on the opposition to the immigration rules introduced by Edward Heath, leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party and prime minister, which saw a boost to their membership, to an estimated 17,500 by 1972. Its popularity was further boosted by the infamous Rivers of Blood speech given by Enoch Powell in 1968. Throughout its active years, the NF were involved in several violent incidences, notably the 1974 Red Lion Square disorders, over the amnesty of illegal immigrants and the 1977 ‘Battle of Lewisham’, which aimed to intimidate local minority residents. However, by the late 90s, its popularity began to decline following the emergence of the British National Party (BNP), receiving just 2,716 votes in the 1997 General Election.British National Party\nThe BNP, founded in 1982 by John Tyndall, was one of the most successful and fastest-growing ERW parties in the twenty-first century. It promoted ethnic nationalism and believed that “being British is more than merely a passport,” as such, it is noted by some, such as Matthew Goodwin, that this is what separates the BNP from other parties in British politics. Throughout the noughties, the BNP established itself as an alternative for working-class voters who were angry at the “political establishment” for its ignorance towards their concerns over immigration. This success led to the party gaining local councillors in the 2002,2003, 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008 Local Elections.\n\n\n== 21st century ==\nThe 2010s saw the rise of the English Defence League (EDL), National Action (NA) and Britain First (BF). At the start of this decade, it was determined that domestic terrorism, such as ERW terrorism, was not a threat to the UK. However, by 2019, the likelihood of such an attack by these groups was high.English Defence League\nThe EDL, founded in 2009, oversaw early “rapid and unprecedented” growth. Its ideology is driven by its opposition to Islam and the supposed “threat” it poses to “our way of life, our customs, and our rule of law.” The successful use of social media allowed for its rapid online growth. However, by the mid-2010s, the EDL's popularity had declined.\nBritain First\nBF, founded by Jim Dowson in 2011, shared views similar to that of the EDL, which included the opposition to multiculturalism and Islam, with the intention of “protecting British and Christian morality.” Throughout its time, BF was largely digital. However, in response to videos of young Muslims intimidating women, gay men and those drinking alcohol, BF became more confrontational in its resistance against Muslims and Islam.National Action\nFounded in 2013 by Christopher Lythgoe, NA is the first group proscribed by the UK government. NA is described as a Neo-Nazi organisation that stirs up “hatred, glorifies violence and promotes vile ideology.” A turning point in ERW ideology in the UK. It focussed mainly on attracting young people through targeted propaganda. In 2016, 22 members were arrested and charged for being members of this group. Though, in the years following many figures linked to this group were arrested on suspicion of plots to commit extremist acts. A couple of examples include the plot to kill Rosie Cooper, in a bid to “replicate” that of Jo Cox and the possession of terrorist manifestos.\n\n\n=== Incidents ===\nIn June 2016, Thomas Mair murdered Labour MP Jo Cox as she walked towards her constituency office.\nIn June 2017, Darren Osbourne carried out a terrorist attack on Muslim worshippers at Finsbury Park Mosque, killing 1 and injuring 12. Ethan Stables was committed to planning a terrorist attack on a Gay Pride event. Jack Renshaw was charged with preparing an attack on Labour MP Rosie Cooper.\nIn April 2019, Stephen Bishop was jailed for plotting to bomb a London mosque.\n\n\n== Current threat ==\nIn the past decade, the threat posed by the ERW has evolved and continues to grow. Before 2014, ERW activity was confined to a small, established group that promoted anti-immigration and white supremacist views. These groups tended to present a low risk to the national security but in recent years multiple attacks have been carried out by people who hold ERW views. An official report, published in 2019, highlighted that the UK had the highest number of ERW terrorist attacks and plots in Europe.\n\n\n== CONTEST ==\nTo counter such incidents and ideologies, the UK government released the counterterrorism strategy CONTEST. The CONTEST plan highlights that there is a “growing threat” from ERW terrorism and that these groups intend to “exploit any anxieties around globalisation, conflict and migration,” so it aims to prevent those who held such views from becoming more radical.The Four P's\nProtect aims to strengthen the protection against a terrorist attack. This involves reducing the physical risk to people, reducing the vulnerability of public venues, transport and infrastructure and reducing the ability of terrorists to access materials of concern.Prepare aims to minimise the impact of an attack and reduce the likelihood of further attacks. This includes the use of training, testing, exercising and ensuring there is an efficient cross-organisational system in place. The objectives include deploying an effective and multi-agency response to save lives and mitigate harm.Prevent aims to stop people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism, through supporting rehabilitation and disengagement of those already involved in terrorism. Early intervention allows for de-radicalisation. In the year ending March 2022, 6,406 referrals were made to prevent. However, critics state that prevent is “incapable of achieving its goal” and stigmatises Muslim communities.Pursue aims to reduce the threat to the UK and UK interests through the detection and investigation of terrorist networks and the disruption of their activities. So, the UK government works with overseas intelligence agencies to share vital information and for exchange of investigative best practices to counter the threat.\n\n\n=== Criticisms ===\nCritics state that CONTEST needs \"urgent work\" as engagement with prevent is voluntary. For example, the attacker of Sir David Amess, was referred to prevent but is said to have very little engagement with the programme.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Gammelgården Museum of Scandia is an open-air museum in Scandia, Minnesota, United States. It is devoted to Swedish immigration history. The museum's mission is to preserve, present, and promote Swedish immigrant heritage. The museum receives around 5,000 visitors each year.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe museum site is on 11 acres (4.5 ha) of land and consists of six historic buildings that are furnished with artifacts dating back to the 1850s. Two buildings, the Parsonage House, (built in 1868) and the Parsonage Barn (built in 1879) are original to the site. Three others, the oldest Lutheran church building in Minnesota (built in 1856),  the Immigrant House, one the first homes in Scandia (built in 1855), the Stuga (built in 1930), were moved to the site. The site also features the Välkommen Hus (Visitor Center).One-third of the approximately 5,000 visitors to the city's Swedish immigrant heritage museum and surrounding park annually travel from Sweden. This can be attributed, in large part, to \"The Emigrants\", a book series from the 1950s by Swedish journalist Vilhelm Moberg that depicts a Swedish family's journey to Chisago County. Lynne Blomstrand Moratzka, the former director of the Gammelgården Museum stated that Swedish tourists, \"read those books and they figure it's their own family's story, so they want to see Minnesota.\"\n\n\n== Programs ==\nThe museum offers guided tours that take visitors on a journey back in time to experience what immigrant life was like in the 1850s. Visitors can also explore the museum's exhibits on their own, which include artifacts, photographs, and documents that tell the story of Swedish immigration to Minnesota.\nThe museum also offers a variety of educational programs and activities, including children's programs, seasonal celebrations, and group tours. Additional museum facilities in a gift shop, picnic areas and playground on site.\n\n\n=== Lucia Dagen ceremony ===\nTraditional Lucia Dagen ceremony at museum features candlelit celebrations in buildings formerly used as a barn and parsonage, a guest house and a residence-turned-granary, as well as The Gammelkyrkan, the oldest Lutheran church building in Minnesota. The girl playing Lucia wears a white dress symbolizing virginity and a red sash for martyrdom, carrying candles on her head to bring light into dark rooms. St. Lucia Day, December 13 tradition marks the start of the Christmas season, connecting immigrants to their heritage and pre-immigrant life.\n\n\n=== Naturalization Ceremonies ===\nThe museum also holds naturalization ceremonies for immigrants, where Scandia Elementary fourth-graders are welcomed to observe the ceremonies and lead everyone in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe inception of the Gammelgården Museum in Scandia dates back to 1971 when the congregation of Elim Lutheran Church discovered the availability of its former pastor's house and barn from the 1850s. Recognized as the oldest Lutheran pastor's house in Minnesota, the church's 1856 log sanctuary, repurposed as a hay barn, was also accessible for relocation and restoration on the 11-acre site.Several members of the church came together to form a committee, leading to the establishment of Gammelgården in 1972, meaning \"old farm\" in Swedish. Over the years, additional buildings have been incorporated into the site, including a welcome center that was unveiled in 2002.On October 6, 2012, the visiting King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf presented his country's prestigious \"Order of the Polar Star\" on Lynne Moratzka, the then director of the Gammelgården Museum in honor of her contributions to Swedish-American culture and heritage during ceremony at the American Swedish Institute of Minneapolis.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of museums in Minnesota",

        "content": "Branitz Palace is a baroque palace with interiors designed by Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau in Cottbus, Brandenburg, Germany. It was built in the 1770s and most of the furnishings date from around 1860. The palace is located in Branitz Park, near the center of Cottbus. It is located in the district of Sandow in Cottbus and borders on the district of Branitz. Branitz Palace is surrounded by a representative pleasure ground, which is divided into several differently themed gardens. The castle is classified as an architectural monument and is included in the list of architectural monuments in Cottbus.\n\n\n== Palace complex ==\n\n\n=== Palace ===\nBranitz Castle was built in 1770 and 1771 for August Heinrich Count von Pückler (1720-1810). The Pückler family had already come into possession of the village of Branitz in 1696. In 1785, the family moved their ancestral seat to Muskau Castle in Bad Muskau and Branitz was leased out. Hermann von Pückler-Muskau eventually had to sell Muskau Castle and its park for financial reasons and moved to Branitz in 1845. There he began to create a landscape park based on the English model. From the following year, Branitz Palace underwent extensive renovations by architects from the Berlin Bauakademie. The plans were drawn up by the architects Rudolf Wilhelm Gottgetreu, Eduard Titz and Ferdinand von Arnim.\nHermann von Pückler-Muskau used Branitz Castle as his retirement home. He died in the castle on February 4, 1871 and was buried in the lake pyramid in Branitz Park. Heinrich, Count von Pückler, a step-cousin of Hermann, subsequently lived in the castle. In 1934, Branitz Park and the castle were transferred from the then still independent municipality of Branitz to Cottbus. After the Second World War, the Princes of Pückler were expropriated and Branitz Castle became public property. Since then, the castle has been used as a museum. From 1946 to 1961, the building housed the Cottbus City Museum and then the Cottbus District Museum until 1990. Today, the museum exhibits the Pückler family home and a collection of paintings by Cottbus landscape painter Carl Blechen. The salons have been restored since 2013, and Prince Pückler's oriental dreams with their colorful paper wallpapers and oriental collection have been open to the public again since 2022.\nLike the park, the palace has been part of the Prince Pückler Museum Park and Palace Branitz Foundation established by the city of Cottbus since 1995, which has been a foundation under public law of the state of Brandenburg since 2018. It is an architectural monument of the city of Cottbus in the list of monuments of the state of Brandenburg. Efforts are currently underway to include Branitz Park and the palace in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Branitz Park and Branitz Castle have been part of the European Garden Heritage Network since May 2019.\n\n\n=== Mews and cavalier house ===\n\nThe mews are located in the castle courtyard to the north of the castle. The building was constructed in the second half of the 18th century during the construction of the palace and was also included in the renovations in the mid-19th century. The stables are relatively lavishly furnished for a stable, with a wooden, finely designed ceiling construction and blue and gold paintwork. Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau kept his favorite noble horses in the stables. His relationship to these animals is also evident in the design of the building. Further building work was carried out in 1877 and the stables were renovated between 1991 and 1993. Today the stables are used for various special exhibitions.\nThe Kavaliershaus was built some time before the palace was built, probably in the first quarter of the 18th century, and housed the court household. In 1857 and 1858, it was included in the palace renovation. The coat of arms of Pückler can be found on the north gable of the Kavaliershaus.The western gable features a zinc cast replica of the Madonna statue created by Friedrich Drake in 1829. The Kavaliershaus has housed a restaurant since 1988.\n\n\n=== Park forge and estate farm ===\n\nThe estate farm is located slightly to the north of the castle. The complex was built between 1852 and 1858 during the castle renovation under Hermann von Pückler-Muskau and consists of the estate inspector's house, the stable and residential buildings and a barn. The stables were historically used as sheep pens. Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau managed his estates from the estate inspector's house. Farm animals were also kept in the stables belonging to the estate farm, while Pückler's favorite horses were housed in the luxuriously furnished stables. All buildings were renovated between 2000 and 2003.\nThe Parkschmiede (Park forge) was built between 1849 and 1851, modeled on the Little Palace in Babelsberg Park. It marks the historical main entrance to the park. In addition to its use as a forge, the building was also the gatehouse for Branitz inner park. Today, the building is used for the collections, photo library, archive and library of the Fürst Pückler Museum.\n\n\n=== Other structures ===\nThere were and are numerous other outbuildings around the palace, such as the park inspector's house (privately owned), the Branitz gatehouse, the former hunter's house and the park economy building. In total, there are 30 park buildings in the inner and outer park.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGeorg Dehio: Handbuch der deutschen Kunstdenkmäler: Brandenburg.

        "content": "\"Branhamism\" (also known as \"Branhamology\") refers to the unique theology and key doctrines taught by William Marrion Branham, including his eschatological views, annihilationism, oneness of the Godhead, predestination, eternal security, and the serpent's seed.  Branham's followers refer to his teachings collectively as \"The Message\". \nMost of Branham's teachings have precedents within sects of the Pentecostal movement or in other non-Pentecostal denominations. The doctrines Branham imported from non-Pentecostal theology and the unique combination of doctrines that he created as a result led to widespread criticism from Pentecostal churches and the Charismatic movement. His unique arrangement of doctrines, coupled with the highly controversial nature of the serpent seed doctrine, caused the alienation of many of his former supporters.\nThe Full Gospel tradition, which has its roots in Wesleyan Arminianism, is the theology generally adhered to by the Charismatic movement and Pentecostal denominations. Branham's doctrines are a blend of both Calvinism and Arminianism, which are considered contradictory by many theologians; the teachings have been described as \"jumbled and contradictory and difficult to categorize\". As a result, the theology he developed in the later years of his life seemed \"complicated and bizarre\" to many people who admired him personally during the years of the healing revival. Many of his followers regard his sermons as oral scripture and believe Branham had rediscovered the true doctrines of the early church.\n\n\n== Divine healing ==\n\nThroughout his ministry, Branham taught a doctrine of faith healing that was often his central teaching during the healing campaign. He believed healing was the main focus of the ministry of Jesus Christ and believed in a dual atonement; \"salvation for the soul and healing for the body\". He believed and taught that miracles ascribed to Christ in the New Testament were also possible in modern times.\nBranham believed that all sickness was a result of demonic activity and could be overcome by the faith of the person desiring healing. Branham argued that God was required to heal when faith was present. This led him to conclude that individuals who failed to be healed lacked adequate faith. Branham's teaching on divine healing were within the mainstream of Pentecostal theology and echoed the doctrines taught by Smith Wigglesworth, Bosworth, and other prominent Pentecostal ministers of the prior generation.\n\n\n== Restorationism ==\n\nOf all of Branham's doctrines, his teachings on Christian restorationism have had the most lasting influence on modern Christianity. Charismatic writer Michael Moriarty described his teachings on the subject as \"extremely significant\" because they have \"impacted every major restoration movement since\". As a result, Moriarty concluded Branham has \"profoundly influenced\" the modern Charismatic movement. Branham taught the doctrine widely from the early days of the healing revival, in which he urged his audiences to unite and restore a form of church organization like the primitive church of early Christianity.\nThe teaching was accepted and widely taught by many of the evangelists of the healing revival, and they took it with them into the subsequent Charismatic and evangelical movements. Paul Cain, Bill Hamon, Kenneth Hagin, and other restoration prophets cite Branham as a major influence. They played a critical role in introducing Branham's restoration views to the Apostolic-Prophetic Movement, the Association of Vineyard Churches, and other large Charismatic organizations. The Toronto Blessing, the Brownsville Revival, and other nationwide revivals of the late 20th century have their roots in Branham's restorationist teachings.\nThe teaching holds that Christianity should return to a form mirroring the primitive Christian church. It supports the restoration of apostles and prophets, signs and wonders, spiritual gifts, spiritual warfare, and the elimination of non-primitive features of modern Christianity. Branham taught that by the end of the first century of Christianity, the church \"had been contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit\". As a result, he believed that from a very early date, the church had stopped following the \"pure Word of God\" and had been seduced into a false form of Christianity.\nHe stated the corruption came from the desire of early Christianity's clergy to obtain political power, and as a result became increasingly wicked and introduced false creeds. This led to denominationalism, which he viewed as the greatest threat to true Christianity. Branham viewed Martin Luther as the initiator of a process that would result in the restoration of the true form of Christianity, and traced the advancement of the process through other historic church figures. He believed the rapture would occur at the culmination of this process. Although Branham referred in his sermons to the culmination of the process as a future event affecting other people, he believed he and his followers were fulfilling his restoration beliefs.\n\n\n== Annihilationism ==\n\nAnnihilationism, the doctrine that the damned will be totally destroyed after the final judgment so as to not exist, was introduced to Pentecostalism in the teachings of Charles Fox Parham (1873–1929). Not all Pentecostal sects accepted the idea. Prior to 1957, Branham taught a doctrine of eternal punishment in hell. By 1957 he began promoting an annihilationist position in keeping with Parham's teachings.\nHe believed that \"eternal life was reserved only for God and his children\". In 1960, Branham claimed the Holy Spirit had revealed this doctrine to him as one of the end-time mysteries. Promoting annihilationism led to the alienation of Pentecostal groups that had rejected Parham's teaching on the subject.\n\n\n== Godhead ==\n\nLike other doctrines, the Godhead formula was a point of doctrinal conflict within Pentecostalism. As Branham began offering his own viewpoint, it led to the alienation of Pentecostal groups adhering to Trinitarianism. Branham shifted his theological position on the Godhead during his ministry. Early in his ministry, Branham espoused a position closer to an orthodox Trinitarian view.\nBy the early 1950s, he began to privately preach the Oneness doctrine outside of his healing campaigns. By the 1960s, he had changed to openly teaching the Oneness position, according to which there is one God who manifests himself in multiple ways; in contrast with the Trinitarian view that three distinct persons comprise the Godhead.\nBranham came to believe that trinitarianism was tritheism and insisted members of his congregation be re-baptized in Jesus's name in imitation of Paul the Apostle. Branham believed his doctrine had a nuanced difference from the Oneness doctrine and to the end of his ministry he openly argued that he was not a proponent of Oneness doctrine. He distinguished his baptismal formula from the Oneness baptism formula in the name of Jesus by teaching that the baptismal formula should be in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. He argued that there were many people named Jesus but there is only one Lord Jesus Christ. By the end of his ministry, his message required an acceptance of the oneness of the Godhead and baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n\n== Opposition to modern culture ==\n\nAs Branham's ministry progressed, he increasingly condemned modern culture. According to Weaver, Branham's views on modern culture were the primary reason the growing Charismatic movement rejected him; his views also prevented him from following his contemporaries who were transitioning from the healing revival to the new movement. He taught that immoral women and education were the central sins of modern culture. Branham viewed education as \"Satan's snare for intellectual Christians who rejected the supernatural\" and \"Satan's tool for obscuring the 'simplicity of the Message and the messenger'\". Weaver wrote that Branham held a \"Christ against Culture\" opinion, according to which loyalty to Christ requires rejection of non-Christian culture.\nPentecostalism inherited the Wesleyan doctrine of entire sanctification and outward holiness from its founders, who came from Wesleyan-influenced denominations of the post-American Civil War era. The rigid moral code associated with the holiness movement had been widely accepted by Pentecostals in the early twentieth century.  Branham's strict moral code echoed the traditions of early Pentecostalism but became increasingly unpopular because he refused to accommodate mid-century Pentecostalism's shifting viewpoint. He denounced cigarettes, alcohol, television, rock and roll, and many forms of worldly amusement.\nBranham strongly identified with the lower-class roots of Pentecostalism and advocated living an ascetic lifestyle. When he was given a new Cadillac, he kept it parked in his garage for two years out of embarrassment. Branham openly chastised other evangelists, who seemed to be growing wealthy from their ministries and opposed the prosperity messages being taught. Branham did not view financial prosperity as an automatic result of salvation. He rejected the financial aspects of the prosperity gospel that originated in the teachings of Oral Roberts and A. A. Allen. Branham condemned any emphasis on expensive church buildings, elaborate choir robes, and large salaries for ministers, and insisted the church should focus on the imminent return of Christ.\nBranham's opposition to modern culture emerged most strongly in his condemnation of the \"immorality of modern women\". He taught that women with short hair were breaking God's commandments and \"ridiculed women's desire to artificially beautify themselves with makeup\". Branham believed women were guilty of committing adultery if their appearance was intended to motivate men to lust, and viewed a woman's place as \"in the kitchen\". Citing the creation story in which Eve is taken from Adam's side, Branham taught that woman was not part of God's original creation, and she was a byproduct of man.\n\nThere is nothing designed to stoop so low, or be filthy, but a woman. A dog can't do it, a hog can't do it, a bird can't do it. No animal is immoral, nor it can be, for it is not designed so it can be. A female hog can't be immoral, a female dog can't be immoral, a female bird can't be immoral. A woman is the only thing can do it. She is designed, alone, for filth and unclean living. ... A dog can't, and no other female can. It's just the woman that can. A dog or any other animals, once a year, and that for her babies; not for sexual pleasure, but for her babies. The old sow hog, the old slut dog, once a year, one moment, that's for her babies. But a woman is designed for any time she desires. ... A woman is a by-product of a man. She's not even in the original creation. That's exactly right. ... By her beauty and her sex control, her shape that was given to her by Satan, the by-product that Satan did, she is sent to deceive sons of God. And she can sway more of them to hell than any other instrument Satan has got. That's exactly right. Only a piece, scrap, made of a man, to deceive him by; God made it, right here has proved it. That's what she was made for.\nAccording to Weaver, \"his pronouncements with respect to women were often contradictory\". Branham once told women who refused to dress according to his instructions \"not to call themselves Christians\" but qualified his denunciations by affirming that obedience to the holiness moral code was not a requirement for salvation. While he did not condemn women who refused the holiness moral code to Hell, he insisted they would not be part of the rapture.\nWeaver wrote that Branham's attitude to women concerning physical appearance, sexual drive, and marital relations was misogynistic, and that Branham saw modern women as \"essentially immoral sexual machines who were to blame for adultery, divorce and death. They were the tools of the Devil.\" Some of Branham's contemporaries accused him of being a \"woman hater\", but he insisted he only hated immorality. According to Edward Babinski, women who follow the holiness moral code Branham supported regard it as \"a badge of honor\".\n\n\n== Serpent seed, Predestination, & Race ==\n\nBranham taught an unorthodox doctrine on the source of original sin. He believed that the story of the fall of man in the Garden of Eden is allegorical and interpreted it to mean that the serpent had sexual intercourse with Eve, and their offspring was Cain. Branham also taught the belief that Cain's modern descendants were masquerading as educated people and scientists, and were \"a big religious bunch of illegitimate bastard children\" who comprised the majority of society's criminals. He believed that the serpent was an intelligent human-like ape he described as the missing link between the chimpanzee and man. Branham believed that the serpent was transformed into a reptile snake after it was cursed by God.\nBranham believed the term \"predestination\" was widely misunderstood and preferred to use the word \"foreknowledge\" to describe his views. Branham's teachings on Predestination were deeply connected to his serpent seed doctrine. Branham taught that humanity's choice in salvation was negated by their ancestry, and that genetics determined one's eternal destiny; the offspring of Cain were foreordained to damnation while the offspring of Seth were foreordained to salvation.\nWeaver commented that Branham seemed unaware that his teachings conflicted with free will, and that he taught a Calvinistic form of the doctrine of predestination and openly supported Calvin's doctrine of Eternal Security, both of which were at odds with the Arminian view of predestination held by Pentecostalism. Unlike his views on the Godhead and Annihilationism, there was no precedent within Pentecostalism for his views on predestination, and opened him to widespread criticism. Branham lamented that more so than any other teaching, Pentecostals criticized him for his predestination teachings.\nAccording to Steven Hassan, \"Branham's sermons lay the foundation to believe that black people are the inferior race.\" Branham used the term \"hybrid\" to describe anything he believed to be tainted by the serpent. Branham accused Eve of producing a \"hybrid\" race, and he provided a way to trace the hybrid line of the Serpent's Seed to Africans and Jews through Ham the biblical progenitor of the African peoples, King Ahab, and Judas Iscariot.\nBranham reported discussing the possibility that blacks were descended from apes as early as 1929, but claimed to reject the belief at the time. In his recorded sermons, Branham first publicly hinted at his belief in the serpent seed doctrine in 1953. He began to openly teach serpent seed in 1958 at the height of racial unrest in the United States.\nDoug Weaver, Jon Schambers, and Michael Barkun have investigated Branham's serpent seed doctrine to identify its origin. Weaver suggested that Branham may have become acquainted with the serpent seed doctrine through his Baptist roots. All three have suggested Branham may been influenced by the teachings of Baptist minister Daniel Parker's two-seed doctrine. Although not widely accepted, Parker's teachings were well known among Baptists in Indiana and Kentucky; Parker also connected the serpent's seed to the non-white races.\nBarkun and Schambers also connected Branham's teaching to the white supremacy movement and Christian Identity preacher Wesley Swift. Branham was baptized and ordained by Roy Davis, a founding member and later Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan; Branham and Davis continued to associate throughout Branham's life. Barkun wrote that Branham was the most significant proponent of the racial teaching outside of Wesley Swift and the Christian Identity movement. Steven Hassan described Branham's Serpent Seed teachings as \"rebranded\" Christian Identity theology.\nBranham was open about the implications of his beliefs and publicly supported segregation.\n\nGod is a segregationalist  [sic]. I am too. Any Christian's a segregation. God segregates His people from all the rest of them. They're... They've always been a segregation. He chose a nation. He chooses a people. He is a segregationalist  [sic]. He made all nations. But still, a real genuine Christian has to be a segregationalist  [sic]. Separating himself from the things of the world and everything, and come into one purpose, Jesus Christ.\nBranham also openly opposed interracial relationships and connected people of mixed race ancestry to the wicked \"hybrid\" race of the serpent.\n\nWhat good would a white woman want to have a baby by a colored man making him a mulatto child? It's not sensible. ... If I was a colored man, or a brown man, or a yellow man, or a red man, I would be just as happy about it. Yes, sir. I sure would. That's the way that my Maker wanted me and that's the way I am. Right. Why does man want to tamper with anything for? When man gets into it, he ruins it. Let it alone the way God made it. Let a man be what he is; by the grace of God let him be. But he has to cause great fusses now calling our... causing riots, and big fusses, and everything else across the nations, and across the world just because he wanted to stick his head out about something. That's the ignorance of the man. That's right; hybrid again. Instead of leaving it the way God wants it, he wants to make his own way. He has to do something about it, you know. He has to make his own self a name. God be merciful to him. It's a pitiful thing.\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \"Not all Branham churches are racist or embrace the anti-race-mixing position,\" \"but the theology clearly invites racism.\" Weaver called Serpent Seed Branham's \"most disreputable\" doctrine. Branham's embrace of the serpent seed doctrine alienated most of the members of his Pentecostal audience. According to Pearry Green, the broader Pentecostal movement considers Branham's version of the serpent seed doctrine repugnant and in their point of view, it was the \"filthy doctrine ... that ruined his ministry.\" No other mainstream Christian group held a similar view; Branham was widely criticized for spreading the doctrine.\nBranham's followers consider the serpent seed doctrine one of his greatest revelations, and his most original; despite its racial nature, most are unaware of the origins of the teaching within the white supremacy movement. When confronted with the accusations of racism, some of his followers have denied the teaching of serpent seed has any connection to white supremacy or racism, and have pointed out that non-white followers of Branham accept the doctrine and its implications. Some African followers of Branham's teachings have embraced the racial components and openly call for the \"submission of the black man to the white man\". Hassan wrote that Branham's followers use \"deceptive tactics to recruit and indoctrinate unsuspecting people,\" and that \"recruiters do not tell new members\" about the historic \"deep ties to white supremacy groups.\" Leaders in Branham's movement have taken actions to prevent followers from discovering the true origin of the serpent seed teaching.\n\n\n== Eschatology and the Seven Seals ==\n\nIn his later years, Branham began to preach almost exclusively on biblical prophecy. In 1960, Branham preached a series of sermons on the seven church ages based on chapters two and three of the Book of Revelation. The sermons used the dispensational system of C. I. Scofield, Clarence Larkin, and Jehovah's Witness founder Charles Taze Russell. As in their dispensational systems, Branham said each church represents a historical age, and that the angel of each age was a significant church figure. Branham identified historical Christian figures as church age messengers, naming some of the same men as Russell.\nWhereas Russell had claimed to be the seventh messenger himself during the 1890s, Branham's sermons differed and he described his own characteristics as the attributes of the Laodicean Church age messenger; Branham believed the age would immediately precede the rapture. Branham explained the Laodicean age would be immoral in a way comparable to Sodom and Gomorrah, and it would be a time in which Christian denominations rejected Christ.  As described by Branham, the characteristics of the Laodicean age resemble the modern era.\nBranham also asserted the final messenger would be a mighty prophet who put the Word of God first, that he would be a lover of the wilderness, that he would hate wicked women, and be an uneducated person. Branham compared the messenger to this last age to John the Baptist and said he would come in the spirit of Elijah the prophet and cited the Book of Malachi 4:5–6 (3:23–24 in Hebrew) as the basis for claiming the Elijah spirit would return.\nBranham preached a series of sermons in 1963 on the Seven Seals, which he regarded as a highlight of his ministry. Branham believed the sermons would produce \"rapturing faith\" which was necessary for his followers to escape the tribulation, and that the sermons contained \"the complete revelation of Jesus Christ\". Weaver wrote that \"the importance of the revelation of the seals to Branham's 'prophetic' identity cannot be overestimated\". Branham viewed the revelation of the seals as the crowning achievement of his ministry and the ultimate fulfillment of his purpose as a prophet.\nAccording to Weaver, the sermons were primarily \"a restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages\". The sermons focused on the Book of Revelation 6:1–17, and provided an interpretation of the meaning of each of the seals, which Branham connected with his prior sermons on the church ages. Like his sermons on the church ages, Branham's sermons on the seals were largely borrowed from the writings of Charles Taze Russell and Clarence Larkin.\nBranham claimed the sermons were inspired through an angelic visitation and the appearance of what he believed to be a supernatural cloud in Arizona that was visible in the American Southwest on February 28, 1963. Branham interpreted the cloud to be the face of Jesus Christ, and a fulfillment of 1 Thessalonians 4:16: \"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout\". Branham believed the events of 1963 indicated the rapture was imminent. As a result of his teachings, many of Branham's followers believe that Jesus Christ returned in some form in 1963.\nBy 1987, it was widely known the cloud Branham believed to be supernatural had been manmade and was reported as such by Weaver in his first biography of Branham. James McDonald of the University of Arizona Institute of Atmospheric Physics was present when the 1963 cloud phenomena appeared. He investigated the phenomena and discovered that the cloud had been created by an exploded Thor rocket carrying a classified spy satellite launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base that failed to make orbit.\nThe United States Air Force later declassified the launch records and acknowledged the manmade origin of the cloud. Military personnel involved in the launch stated that they had \"immediately recognized the McDonald cloud as from an explosion of a rocket the afternoon of 28 February 1963\". Branham claimed to his audiences that he was hunting in Arizona when angels appeared to him and created the cloud overhead. Peter Duyzer presented evidence that Branham falsely claimed to be hunting in Arizona when the cloud appeared, and was actually in Texas where he was assisting with efforts to have the death sentence of Leslie Elaine Perez overturned.\nIn his sermons on the seven seals, Branham again indicated he was a prophet who had the anointing of Elijah and was a messenger heralding the second coming of Christ. Branham did not directly claim to be the end-time messenger in either of his sermons on the church ages or the seven seals. Weaver believed Branham desired to be the eschatological prophet he was preaching about, but had self-doubt. At the time, Branham continued to leave the identity of the messenger open to the interpretation of his followers, who widely accepted that he was that messenger.\nBeginning in 1958, Branham began to claim Luke 17:30 was being fulfilled. By the 1960s, he began to make frequent references to the scripture claiming that through his ministry the \"Son of Man was being revealed\". According to Weaver, Branham's \"obsession with Luke 17:30 and Malachi 4:5–6 dominated the end of his ministry\". In 1964 and 1965 he began to make special emphasis that the Son of Man could only be revealed through the ministry of a prophet. Branham's teachings on the subject caused confusion among his followers who repeatedly asked him to clarify his relationship to Christ. Some of his followers believed he was claiming divinity and were prepared to accept his claims.\nBranham's responses and statements on the subject of his divinity were contradictory, leaving his followers divided on the subject. In his final revival meetings before his death, Branham stated \"The Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is to come according to Luke 17:30. The Son of Man is to reveal Himself among His people. Not a man, God. But it'll come through a prophet.\" His final statement on the subject convinced a number of his followers he was indeed claiming divinity.\n\n\n== Anti-denominationalism ==\nBranham believed denominationalism was \"a mark of the beast\", which added to the controversy surrounding his later ministry. Branham stated that he was not opposed to organizational structures; his concern focused on the \"road block to salvation and spiritual unity\" he believed denominations created by emphasizing loyalty to their organizations. Branham's doctrine was similar to the anti-Catholic rhetoric of classical Pentecostalism and Protestantism, which commonly associated the mark of the beast with Catholicism.\nBranham, however, adopted the teaching of Charles Taze Russell which associated the image of the beast with Protestant denominations. In his later years, he came to believe all denominations were \"synagogues of Satan\". Branham's teaching was particularly damaging to his relationship with Pentecostal denominations who were angered that he would associate them with the mark of beast.\nScholar Robert Price and Doug Weaver suggested that Branham's stance on denominations was developed in response to their rejection of his teachings in an attempt to maintain the loyalty of his closest followers. Throughout the 1960s, Branham demanded his listeners leave any denomination they were part of to demonstrate their loyalty to him and his message. He argued that continued allegiance to any denomination would lead to an acceptance of the mark of the beast, which would mean missing the rapture.  He insisted the prior healing revival when he cooperated with denominations had been a preparatory step to get the attention of God's chosen people, so he could eventually inform them of their need to exclusively follow his teaching ministry.\n\n\n== Prophecies ==\nBranham issued a series of prophecies during his lifetime. One of his first was a prophetic vision he reported having in 1916 foretelling that 16 men would fall to their death during the construction of the Clark Memorial Bridge. Branham claimed repeatedly throughout his ministry that the vision was fulfilled during the 1927–1929 construction of the bridge, but there is no evidence of the drownings having ever occurred. Branham also claimed that he foretold the coming of the 1937 Ohio River Flood, the same flood he told his audience led to the death of his wife and daughter.\n\nHis most significant prophecies were a series of prophetic visions he claimed to have in June 1933. The first time he published any information about the visions were in 1953. Branham reported that in his visions he saw seven major events would occur before the Second Coming of Christ, including the prediction of the rise of Adolf Hitler, the Second World War, the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, and the rise of communism. Most of his predictions had already been fulfilled by the first time he reported the visions in 1953.\nIn the 1933 visions, he reported seeing self-driving \"egg-shaped\" cars in one vision. Branham later claimed he saw a car in 1960 that fulfilled his vision. Among the prophecies was also a prediction that the United States would \"elect the wrong president\" as a result of giving women the right to vote, which he later interpreted to be John F. Kennedy. He also predicted a powerful woman would take control of the United States, which he later interpreted to be the Roman Catholic Church, which he reported as also being fulfilled with the election of Kennedy who was Roman Catholic. His visions ended with the apocalyptic destruction of the United States that left the nation's cities in smoldering ruins. After sharing his prophetic visions, Branham offered a prediction that the rapture would happen by 1977.\nIn 1964, Branham said judgement would strike the west coast of the United States and that Los Angeles would sink into the ocean, his most dramatic prediction. Following the 1964 prophecy, Branham again predicted the rapture would happen by 1977 and would be preceded by various worldwide disasters, the unification of denominational Christianity, and the rise-to-power of the Roman Catholic Pope. Branham was deeply anti-Catholic, and viewed the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church as the agents of Satan who would bring about the end of the world. Branham's prediction of the end of the world by 1977 was widely circulated and well known. After the world failed to end in 1977, Time Magazine included the failed prediction as one of the \"top ten end-of-the-world prophecies\".\nWeaver wrote that Branham gradually revised and embellished some of his prophecies over time, sometimes substantially. Critics of Branham investigated his prophecies. They claimed that many of Branham prophecies were only publicly reported after their fulfillment. Duzyer also reported that several of Branham's prophecies, like the 16 drownings or the destruction of the United States, were never fulfilled. Branham's followers believe his prophecies came true, or will do so in the future.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBabinski, Edward T. (1995).

        "content": "On February 8, 2013, fighting broke out between the Red Berets of Mali's 33rd Parachute Commando Regiment and the Green Berets in the military camp in Djicoroni, Bamako, Mali. The  Red Berets supported the regime of Amadou Toumani Touré, who was overthrown in a coup led by Amadou Sanogo and supported by the Green Berets in 2012.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAmadou Sanogo overthrew the administration of Malian president of Amadou Toumani Touré (ATT) in 2012 due to grievances within the army, police, and national guard over ATT's lackluster handling of the Tuareg rebellion in 2012. The Red Berets of Mali's 33rd Parachute Commando Regiment, one of the most elite military units in Mali, supporting the ousted ATT, launched a counter-coup in Kati in April 2012, but failed.\nOn January 30, 2013, twenty-nine prisoners from the counter-coup attempt, including twenty-six soldiers and three civilians, were released from Malian detention. One of those released was Malamine Konaré, son of former Malian president Alpha Oumar Konaré. Twenty putschists remained imprisoned however, with their families organizing a protest at the Malian military camp in Djicoroni on January 31 to free them. Remaining red berets sent a message to president Dioncounda Traoré, requesting authorization to be sent to northern Mali to fight the jihadist insurgency.\nOn Malian national television, General Tahirou Dembélé stated that the Red Berets will be sent north to fight the Islamists alongside French forces, although in different units. Red Berets who did not oblige would be disbanded from the regiment. 417 men joined the front alongside the French, but 800 remained in Bamako out of protest.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nClashes broke out at the Djicoroni military camp on February 8, where the Red Berets lived with their families. Both Red Berets and Green Berets blamed the other for instigating the clashes. The Malian Ministry of Defense stated that the Red Berets were revolting due to the \"disciplinary measures\" against them, while the Red Berets stated Green Berets planned and conducted the attack in defense of Sanogo.\nA doctor living in the camp stated that troops of the Malian National Guard and national police invaded the camp around 5am. He stated that the Green Berets and allies \"fired warning shots into the camp. Then, an 18-year-old was shot and killed. There were five women and around ten children injured by bullets.\" Women and children blocked the entrance to the camp by the Green Berets and allies, after they claimed they needed \"to secure it.\" As tensions increased, one protestor stated that the Green Berets would enter the camp \"over our dead bodies.\" This sparked clashes as the women and children picked up sticks and stones, and the Green Berets shot at them. Elements of the National Guard, Gendarmerie, the Malian Air Force, and Green Berets took part in the attack, using BRDM-2's.\nAnother source reported that shots first broke out in the camp around 7am, and the clashes continued until midday. A local resident testified that Green Berets arrived and surrounded the camp. Women and children were chased out of the camp, following Green Berets. Police present at the scene did not shoot, and just ran off. Further reinforcements arrived at the camp around 7am, sparking the battle.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe first assessment detailed by a Malian official stated that one person was killed and six were wounded. Both sides had injuries, but the dead soldier was a Red Beret. A civilian nearby stated that three people were killed, a boy and two women. Five women were injured in the crossfire as well. A Malian government press release later stated that two teenagers were killed and thirteen were injured. The Red Berets stated that six people were killed, including two women and four teenagers. Another Malian military official stated that three soldiers were killed between both sides.\nPresident Dioncounda Traoré urged calm between the two sides, and a French mission that arrived in Bamako that same day stated the \"army was in a state of despair.\" Malian junta officials arrested various Red Berets, with General Yamoussa Camara siding with Sanogo on a military crackdown on the Red Berets, labeling them as deserters. Prime Minister Django Sissoko led political negotiations with the Red Berets in the days after the battle. Sissoko on February 15 stated that the Red Berets would no longer be disbanded, and instead \"restructured\".\n\n\n== External links ==\nRed Berets, Green Berets: Can Mali's Divided Military Restore Order and Stability? - Jamestown Foundation, February 22, 2013\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Grete Ly (October 20, 1885 as Grethe Lichtenstein in Beuthen - April 1, 1942 in Kaindorf an der Sulm, Austria) was a German soubrette, theater and silent film actress and film producer.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nThe daughter of the merchant Siegfried Lichtenstein and his wife Johanna, née. Steinitz, began her stage career in 1908 at the newly built Stadttheater in Katowice. In 1910, she worked at Berlin theaters, from 1911 in Vienna at the theater and in operetta. From 1918, she appeared in front of the camera for several films, some of which she produced herself with the Grete Ly Film-Gesellschaft Reß & Berger OHG (from December 1920: Grete Ly Film-Gesellschaft Grete Reß). Already at the beginning of the 1920s, she largely withdrew into private life. Presumably in connection with repressions that threatened her because of her Jewish descent, she committed suicide in 1942.\nGrete Ly was married four times: from 1910 to 1911 to the actor Richard Großmann, from 1913 to 1921 to the lawyer Ernst Reß, then from 1923 to 1925 to the banker Julius Feige and finally from 1926 until her death to the Major Gustav del Cott.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n1918: Die schöne Risette (actress)\n1919: Menschen (actress and producer)\n1919: Todesurteil (actress and producer)\n1920: Dieb und Weib (actress and producer)\n1920: Sturm (actress and producer)\n1921: Die Ratten (producer)\n\n\n== Literature ==\nRainer E.

It was during this time that Gibson worked for Danny O'Quinn Jr.'s USAR Hooters Pro Cup Series team; Gibson went to the same high school with O'Quinn Jr. After O'Quinn Jr. went on to drive for Roush Racing in the NASCAR Busch Series, Gibson went on to work for Henderson Motorsports. Afterwards, he went on to work for Morgan–McClure Motorsports as a front tire changer for the No. 4 Chevrolet driven by Ward Burton before he was laid off along with twenty other crew members the following year. He has also worked as a tire specialist for ThorSport Racing. It was also during this time where he continued to race sporadically, winning the limited late model championship at Lonesome Pine Speedway in 2022.\nIn 2024, Gibson participated in pre-season testing for the ARCA Menards Series at Daytona International Speedway driving for Rise Motorsports in the No. 31 Chevrolet, and placed 64th in the overall results between the two testing days. It was also announced that Gibson would attempt to make his debut in the season opening race at Daytona with Rise. After placing 35th in the sole practice session, he ultimately failed to qualify for the race after setting the 47th quickest time in qualifying. Afterwards, it was announced that Gibson would run the No. 31 for Rise at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\n\n\n== Perosnal life ==\nGibson currently resides in Weyers Cave, Virginia, and has three children.

It a residencial area dominated by single family housing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe ealierst known records of Moczydło date to 1528. It was a small farming community, located on the road leading to Imielin, within the Catholic Parish of St. Catherine. The village was owned and inhabited by a petty nobility. Between 1580 and 1658, the village, and its adjusted farmlands, had an area of around 9 ha, and in 1661, there were 5 houses.\nIt was owned by Dąbrowski family until 1725, when it was sold together with Wolica to Elżbieta Sieniawska, owner of the Wilanów Estate for the price of 60,000 złoties. She has ordered protection of the nearby Kabaty Woods from deforestation. In 1775, the village had 7 houses, and in 1785, 10 houses. In 1827, it had 10 houses and 80 inhabitants. Between 1850 and 1861, the population of Moczydło fought in court to lower costs of their feudal duties. Following the abolition of serfdom in 1864, the village was incorporated into the municipality of Wilanów. At the time it was inhabited by 131 people and included 360 ha privately owned farmland, and 36 ha of nobility-owned farmland. In 1905, there were 20 houses and 146 inhabitants.\nIn 1879, in Moczydło was built horse stable, owned by count Ludwik Józef Krasiński, and the village became specialised in breeding horses for the local upee class. In the 1930s, it became a suplier for the newly opened nearby Służewiec Horse Racing Track. It operated until the beginning of the Second World War. The ruins of the stable survive to the present day, now with the protected status of a cultural property.\nFollowing the end of the war, the farmlands in the area were nationalised. On 14 May 1951, Moczydło was incorporated into the city of Warsaw. In 1956, the area was given by the state to the Warsaw University of Life Sciences.\nIn 2009, there was opened the Moczydełko Park.\nCurrently, the area is a residencial neighbourhood, dominated by single-family housing, with some presence of the multifamily housing. There remain a few surviving historical structures of the former village.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nMoczydło is a residencial neighbourhood within the district of Ursynów located within the City Information System areas of Kabaty and Natolin. It is dominated by the single-family housing, with some presence of the multifamily housing.\nBetween Stryjeńskich Street and Wełniana Street is place the Moczydełko Park, which is centred on the pond Moczydło 3. Nearby are also ponds Moczydło 1 and Moczydło 2.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Annemarie Seidel (born November 28, 1894, in Braunschweig - August 30, 1959 in Munich) was a German actress and proofreader.\n\n\n== Life ==\nAnnemarie Seidel, called Mirl, was a younger sister of the writer Ina Seidel (1885–1974). When she was barely a year old, her family left Braunschweig, where Annemarie Seidel had been born. Her father, Hermann Seidel, took his own life in November 1895. The cause was presumably an impending disciplinary proceeding against the physician for incorrect treatment. The family first moved to Marburg and later to Munich, where Annemarie Seidel made a career as an actress at the beginning of the Weimar Republic. During this time, she met Carl Zuckmayer, with whom she lived together in 1921/22. After falling dangerously ill, she had to leave Zuckmayer's damp basement apartment in Matthäikirchstraße 4 - the writer Julius Elias lived in the same house. Her \"savior\" in this situation was the Dutch millionaire and musicologist Anthony van Hoboken. He became Annemarie Seidel's first husband. This marriage lasted from 1922 to 1932. In 1935 she married Peter Suhrkamp. Her marriage to Peter Suhrkamp suffered from Annemarie Seidel's alcoholism in later years. The divorce had already been decided, but Suhrkamp died on March 31, 1959, two days before the court hearing. Annemarie Seidel died only a few months later.\nAnnemarie Seidel worked as an editor for Suhrkamps Verlag. She also translated the novel The Grass Harp by Truman Capote into German together with Friedrich Podszus. Friedrich Podszus was also the heir to her last apartment in Munich's Ohmstraße.\n\n\n== Correspondence ==\nAnnemarie Seidel and Carl Zuckmayer remained friends for many years. Their correspondence lasted until 1957 and was published in 2003.\nThe publication of Peter Suhrkamp's letters to his wife under the title Letters to Mirl was planned for May 2009. The letters date from the period between 1935 and Peter Suhrkamp's death in 1959. They had long been considered lost. Letters from Annemarie Seidel to Peter Suhrkamp had not been found until then. In May 2009, however, the editor Wolfgang Schopf found more than 40 letters from Annemarie Seidel to her husband from the period from April 1944 to February 1945. The project Letters to Mirl was thus expanded at the last moment. On March 28, 2016, Peter Suhrkamp's 125th birthday, a total of 450 letters that Suhrkamp and Annemarie Seidel had exchanged were finally published under the title \"Nun leb wohl! And be well!\" were published.\n\n\n== External links ==\nLiterature by and about Annemarie Suhrkamp in the German National Library catalogue\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Ruth Bietenhard, née Lehmann (11 January 1920 in Bern – 19 February 2015 in Thun), was a Swiss author and teacher. She became known as the editor of the Bernese German Dictionary and for her Bible translation into Bernese German.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBietenhard was the daughter of a Bernese notary. She attended the Muristalden Seminary School (Campus Muristalden), the Neue Mädchenschule and the Freies Gymnasium Bern, from which she graduated in 1938 with an A-matura. After studying Romance languages and literature in Bern, Geneva and Paris, she obtained a grammar school teaching diploma in French, Italian and Latin in Bern in 1945 and completed her doctorate in Romance languages and literature here in 1949 with the dissertation Le sémantisme des mots expressifs en Suisse Romande.\nIn 1969, her great-uncle Otto von Greyerz left her his linguistic legacy of around 5,000 words in Bernese German, from which she published the Bernese German Dictionary in 1976. She later wrote specialised articles and had a column on language and dialect for the newspaper Der Bund until 2003. She taught French at Seminar Thun from 1977 to 1980, taught Bernese German elsewhere and wrote other books. Together with her husband, she translated the New Testament into the Bernese German dialect from 1980 to 1984 and parts of the Old Testament from 1990 to 1994.\nIn 1946 she married the theologian Hans Bietenhard. They moved to Steffisburg and had six children together. She actively supported her husband until 1969 in building up the Sonnenfeld-Schwäbis parish, which was directly adjacent to the town of Thun. She also served as church council and parish president in Steffisburg. As a conservative woman, she belonged politically to the SVP, although she was also interested in feminist theology.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nBurger Medal of the City of Bern.\nIn 1993, she received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Theology of the University of Bern.\nIn 1994, together with her husband, she became an honorary citizen of Steffisburg.\n\n\n== Works ==\nBerndeutsches Wörterbuch (based on the work of Otto von Greyerz, first edition 1976), 9.

        "content": "Lioba Albus (born September 27, 1958) is a German actor and cabaret actress.\n\n\n== Career ==\nLioba Albus was born and grew up in Attendorn,  Sauerland as the seventh child of her parents Heinrich and Hedwig Albus. After her Abitur at St.-Ursula-Gymnasium in 1977, she studied theater studies in Munich and attended the private acting school Zinner. During her training, she first appeared in touring theaters for children, and from 1983 she was a member of the permanent ensemble of the Dortmunder Kinder- und Jugendtheater. Before moving to Dortmund, she worked as an announcer for Bayerischer Rundfunk.\nSince 1991, Lioba Albus has performed as a cabaret artist on stage, radio and television. Her main broadcaster is WDR. She has appeared in the programs Mitternachtsspitzen, Ladies Night, Blond am Freitag and 7 Tage, 7 Köpfe, among others. From 1995 to 2001, she hosted the WDR radio program Unterhaltung am Wochenende. In her home town of Attendorn, she hosts the annual Gauklerfest.\nLioba Albus has three children and lives in Dortmund. A cousin is the actor and dubbing artist Thomas Albus.\n\n\n== Program ==\nThe cabaret artist takes up everyday situations in a satirical way and exaggerates typical social behaviour. Her most popular topic is the relationship between men and women. She often slips into the role of the fictitious Sauerland housewife \"Mia Mittelkötter\", who reveals her (sometimes only superficially) simple wisdom. Some press reviews have called Lioba Albus a \"volcano of words\".\nSolo programs:\n\nMit heißem Herzen\nWenn Männer zuviel liegen\nGewählte Höhepunkte - Kabarett à la carte\nOwie lacht\nVon der Göttin zur Gattin\nSingle Bells (Weihnachts-program)\nKönigin von Egoland\nHitzewallungen (summer program)\nDas Weg ist mein Ziel\nMia - eine Weltmacht mit 3 BuchstabenLioba Albus also performed with the cabaret artist Martin Herrmann (alias \"Der Frauenflüsterer\"), with the program Pottsau trifft Frauenflüsterer, with Norbert Alich in the program Was Gott getrennt....

The historic stone house was built around 1781 by tradition, perhaps later by architectural evidence. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 10, 1983, for its significance in architecture. It was listed as part of the Early Stone Houses of Bergen County Multiple Property Submission (MPS).According to the nomination form, Albert Terhune bought 330 acres (130 ha) here in 1746. The house was left to his son, John Albert Terhune, and then to his son, Albert Terhune. The house next went to his brother Harmon Terhune, and then his sister Elizabeth Terhune, who married John Eckerson Hopper, listed as the owner in 1846.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Bergen County, New Jersey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A data memory-dependent prefetcher (DMP) is a cache prefetcher that looks at cache memory content for possible pointer values, and prefetches the data at those locations into cache if it sees memory access patterns that suggest following those pointers would be useful.\nAs of 2022, data prefetching was already a common feature in CPUs, but most prefetchers do not inspect the data within the cache for pointers, instead working by monitoring memory access patterns. Data memory-dependent prefetchers take this one step further.\nThe DMP in Apple's M1 computer architecture was demonstrated to be capable of being used as a memory side-channel in an attack published in early 2024. At that time its authors did not know of any practical way to exploit it. The DMP was subsequently discovered to be even more opportunistic than previously thought, and has now been demonstrated to be able to be used to effectively attack a variety of cryptographic algorithms in work called GoFetch by its authors.\nIntel Core processors also have DMP functionality (Intel use the term \"Data Dependent Prefetcher\") but Intel states that they have features to prevent their DMPs being used for side-channel attacks. The authors of GoFetch state that they were unable to make their exploit work on Intel processors.\n\n\n== References ==",

After joining on (Government College Chittur) college, he meets Sara Mary John and falls in love with her. However, a fight between Tamilans and the locals was erupted soon after. A so-called college fight was turned out to be more when politicians and police were involved.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nOn 2 December 2021, K. E. Gnanavel Raja's Studio Green officially announced that they would collaborate with C. V. Kumar's Thirukumaran Entertainment for their 25th production venture. Directed by debutante Nikesh RS, the film was titled as Rebel. While G. V. Prakash Kumar would play the lead actor and also score the music, a muhurat puja was held the same day at a film studio in Chennai. The cinematography and editing would be handled by Arun Radhakrishnan and Vetre Krishnan, respectively.

There is no rebellion in imitation, and hopefully, Nikesh will do better in his next\".Harshini S V of Film Companion said,\"These shots pull you out of the film's world and wonder:in a film as serious and important as this, shouldn't hero worship be the least of its concerns?\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRebel at IMDb",

It was first discovered and observed during the IRAS Sky Survey. This is a relatively short-lived phenomenon that gives astronomers an opportunity to watch the early stages of planetary nebula formation, hence the name protoplanetary, or preplanetary nebula. \n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIRAS 13208-6020 has a very clear bipolar form, with two very similar outflows of material in opposite directions and a dusty ring around the star. It does not shine, but is instead illuminated by light from the central star. IRAS 13208-6020 is not currently in the planetary nebula stage, and it is assumed to be very early in its lifespan.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) is a member of the species Alphanudivirus oryrhinocerotis in the family Nudiviridae. It causes lethal infections in larvae and adults of the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros), a serious pest of coconut and oil palms in tropical Asia and the Pacific. The virus was discovered by Alois Huger in 1963 while searching for diseases of O. rhinoceros in Malaysia. It has been demonstrated to be an effective biological control agent against this beetle pest.\n\n\n== Description and biology ==\nThe Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus develops in the nuclei of infected cells, where the rod-shaped capsids are assembled to a size of 180 x 65 nm. Like in other nudiviruses, the capsids have a characteristic thread-like tail. They acquire an envelop and the final virus particles have a size of 220 x 120 nm.\n\nThe Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus is a double-stranded DNA virus with a large circular DNA molecule. The example (representative) isolate Ma07 has 127,615 base pairs and 139 open reading frames. Among others, the genes are associated with DNA replication and virus structure.\nThe virus is transmitted perorally in O. rhinoceros larvae and adults. In O. rhinoceros larvae, the virus multiplies mainly in the fat body. As a result, the fat body disintegrates and the infected larvae have a transparent appearance. In O. rhinoceros adult beetles, the virus infects mainly the cells of the midgut. Midgut cells killed by the virus are discharged into the gut lumen. The gut becomes filled with virus particles and the infected adult beetles excrete the virus, transmitting it efficiently within the O. rhinoceros population. Transmission of the virus is important for maintaining it within the beetle population, since it does not persist for long outside its beetle host.\nInfected third instar larvae typically die after around 3 weeks, 1st and 2nd instars earlier. Virus infections are, however, not transmitted to the pupal stage and adult beetles emerging from the pupae are always uninfected. They acquire infections through contact with infected larvae or adult beetles in breeding sites, or during mating and feeding in coconut palms. Virus infections reduce the lifespan and fecundity of the adult beetles. Infected females stop laying eggs and there is no transmission through the egg stage.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nAlois Huger described the virus as being similar to viruses from the family Baculoviridae, but lacking the proteinaceous crystals which surround and protect baculovirus particles. He named it Rhabdionvirus oryctes, however it became subsequently mainly known as Oryctes rhinoceros virus (OrV). A genomic analysis in 2007 revealed similarities to another unassigned and non-occluded baculovirus, the Heliothis zea virus 1, but significant differences to other baculoviruses. Therefore, the new genus Nudivirus was proposed for both viruses within the Baculoviridae.\nFurther studies on the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus and other non-occluded baculoviruses led to the conclusion that they are significantly different from other members of the family Baculoviridae. Therefore, in 2012/2013, the creation of a new family, the Nudiviridae, was proposed with several new genera replacing the genus Nudivirus. The Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus was regarded as the type species (now called 'example') for the first genus, the genus Alphanudivirus, and for the new family. Since the introduction of the binomial system in virus taxonomy, the species Alphanudivirus oryrhinocerotis is recognized with the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus belonging to this species.\n\n\n== Prevalence and introduction ==\nThe Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus has been found to be naturally present in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and India. It appears to be widely distributed in tropical parts of Asia, that is the native distribution range of its host, the coconut rhinoceros beetle. However, it was absent in the Pacific Islands invaded by O. rhinoceros and in the islands of the Maldives. Releases of the virus into virus-free islands resulted in a significant reduction of the beetle population.\nThe virus affects mainly the population of O. rhinoceros adults, spreading easily among adult beetles and reducing their lifespan and fecundity. In Samoa and the Maldives, where the virus was introduced, the infection rate among adult beetles was typically between 30 and 40% after its introduction, whereas the virus was only found in 10% or less of the larval breeding sites. In countries where the virus is naturally present (Philippines, Indonesia) the incidence of virus infections among adult beetles is also usually higher than the number of breeding sites containing the virus.\n\nComparing O.rhinoceros populations before and after the introduction of the virus in the Maldives as well as populations in the Philippines and in Indonesia with different levels of virus prevalence showed that the average lifespan of adult beetles was reduced to less than one half in populations with a high level of virus infections. This corresponds well to the reduced palm damage following the introduction of the virus. This reduction of palm damage was well documented in Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga and Fiji.\nThe palm damage depends on the density of palms, since the same number of O. rhinoceros adults per hectare will cause less damage in areas with a high palm density compared to areas with a low palm density. For accurate comparison of the effect of the virus on the O. rhinoceros population, it is therefore necessary to account for the density of the palms and convert the palm damage into an estimate of the number of feeding O. rhinoceros adults per hectare. In the Maldives, such a conversion showed that the introduction of the virus often reduced the number of O. rhinoceros adults attacking coconut palms to less than one quarter of the level before the release.\n\n\n== Resistance to the virus ==\nThere is evidence that some O. rhinoceros populations have developed resistance to the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus. This is reflected in a natural low level of virus infections in some populations (e.g. South Sulawesi and Java in Indonesia), combined with a high level of palm damage, as well as high resistance to artificial virus inoculations in the invasive O. rhinoceros population in Guam. In Guam, the resistant population was found to belong to a specific haplotype (haplotype G) of O. rhinoceros which is also present in Indonesia, the Philippines, Palau, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.\nAt the same time it was shown in laboratory experiments that O. rhinoceros larvae and adults have different sensitivities to different strains of the virus. Virus releases with different strains in the Maldives supported these laboratory results. Therefore, resistance to the virus seems to be a combination of a general insensitivity to virus inoculations and differences in the virulence of different virus strains.\nThis was also supported by virus releases in coconut plantations in Central Java, Indonesia. In Java, the O. rhinoceros population was initially thought to be virus free, but was later found to have an extremely low level of natural virus infections, suggesting resistance to the virus. In 1976 and 1977, O. rhinoceros adult beetles infected with a virus strain from Sumatra were released in 8 locations in Java, while keeping 4 nearby locations untreated for comparison. Three years after the release, the palm damage in the treated areas had declined from 67.5% to 20.8%, expressed in % of fronds damaged. In the untreated areas the damage had not changed significantly (69.4% before and 76.5% after the release). Resurveying the treated and untreated areas in 1987, 10 years after the virus release, still showed a low damage level in the treated areas (17.1%) and some reduction in the untreated areas (41.8%).\n\n\n== Ecology of the virus ==\nAlthough the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus has been demonstrated to be able to suppress O. rhinoceros populations effectively, outbreaks by the beetle can still develop during replanting of coconut or oil palms, even in the presence of the virus. Under such conditions many breeding sites become available and transmission of the virus is often interrupted. Transmission of the virus occurs when infected adult beetles come in contact with healthy larvae and adults in breeding sites, apart from contact between adults in palm trees.\nDuring replanting, when many breeding places become available, the contact between adults and larvae is reduced, because many potential breeding places are not yet occupied. Under such conditions it is advisable to hide the decaying coconut or oil palm trunks by planting cover crops around them. Cover crops not only hide the decaying palm trunks from the beetle, they also have a repellent effect on O. rhinoceros. In addition, the spread of the virus can be promoted by leaving a few dead standing coconut palms in the replanted area. Dead standing coconut palms are the most preferred breeding places, there is frequent contact between adult beetles and larvae in dead standing palms and they are hot spots for virus transmission. As pointed out above, other factors like the density of palms or resistance to the virus can also influence the ecology of the virus.\n\n\n== References ==",

The historic stone house was built in 1790 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 10, 1983, for its significance in architecture. It was listed as part of the Early Stone Houses of Bergen County Multiple Property Submission (MPS).According to the nomination form, the house may have built by Abraham Terhune, but more likely by his son, Albert Demarest Terhune. Hassel Garretson bought it in 1816, Peter D. Westervelt in 1839, and Jacob P. Hopper in 1854.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Bergen County, New Jersey\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Neudeck Palace (Polish: Zamek w Świerklańcu; German: Schloss Neudeck) was the residence of the aristrocratic Henckel von Donnersmarck family in Upper Silesia. The palace complex and park was one of the largest and most magnificent in the German Empire and was popularly known as Little Versailles or Upper Silesian Versailles. It is located around two kilometers south-east of the town of Neudeck (Polish: Świerklaniec) in the Tarnogórski Góry County in Poland.\nThe Old and New Palace were set on fire by the Red Army in 1945 and demolished in August 1961. Today, the complex consists of the palace park, the Cavalier Palace, the Donnersmarck funeral chapel and several farm buildings and monuments.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the Middle Ages, the area around today's Świerklaniec was a strategically important point, as the Brynica formed a natural border between Silesia and Poland. In addition, an important trade route ran from Częstochowa to Bytom. As early as the 11th century, a manor house was built to fortify the border, which later became the present-day Old Castle. It was surrounded by a moat and a mound of earth for defense purposes. It was also the seat of a starost of Boleslaus the Brave. In 1179, Duke Mieszko I of Ratibor acquired the manor from the Polish Duke Casimir II. Later, it was the Cieszyn princes who took over the Świerklaniec estate from the Ratibors in 1337. The manor was probably expanded into a fortified castle by Duke Konrad II of Oels during this transitional period, although there were 18 principalities and several estates in Silesia at this time, meaning that almost every major town was the seat of its own principality.\nThe 15th century was characterized by many changes of rule. The last documented mention of the Cieszyns as owners was in 1451. In 1477, Świerklaniec was first mentioned as part of the Duchy of Bytom and in the same year the name of the border castle Swiklenczy was mentioned for the first time. The Opole Duke John II, the last Opole Piast, acquired the area around Bytom for 19,000 guilders in 1498 and rebuilt the existing castle. Bricks were used in the Gothic style. At this time, Neudeck was part of the most important Silesian principality. When John ran out of money in 1526, the castle had to be mortgaged. Six years later, in 1532, the year of his death, the lordship of Neudeck and the entire surrounding area fell to Georg von Brandenburg-Ansbach and thus to the House of Hohenzollern. This gave Świerklaniec a certain political significance for the first time, which lasted a good hundred years. During the Thirty Years' War, the Hohenzollern lost their entire Upper Silesian possessions to the Habsburgs in 1621, who were only able to call them their own for a very short time.\n\n\n=== Ownership by the Donnersmarcks ===\n\nIn 1623, Lazarus I Henckel von Donnersmarck initially received the estate as a pledge from the Silesian High and Princely Court, thus ushering in the long Donnersmarck era. The name Neudeck appears for the first time in this context. On May 26, 1629, his son Lazarus II officially purchased the Neudeck estates from Emperor Ferdinand II and made Neudeck the seat of a Donnersmarck line. From then on, the entire Donnersmarck estate was indivisible hereditary property. The family was elevated to imperial counts in 1651. In 1670, the hereditary lands were divided into the entailed estates of Beuthen (Byton) and Tarnowitz-Neudeck. The first representative of the Protestant Tarnowitz-Neudeck line was Carl Maximilian Count Henckel von Donnersmarck. Between 1670 and 1680, he had the old castle redesigned by an Italian into a prestigious Renaissance residence with an adjoining park. In keeping with the spirit of the times, the castle was \"modernized\" in Baroque style in the 18th century.\n\n\n=== The 19th century ===\n\nIn the 19th century, Count Carl Lazarus increased the family's holdings by purchasing new estates. It was during this time that the estate underwent its most significant alterations. First, the old castle was extended and rebuilt in the Tudor style. In 1848, Carl Lazarus transferred his entire estate to his son Guido Count Henckel von Donnersmarck, probably the most important scion of the family.\nThe construction of a new, second palace was then begun on the large lake in the palace park in 1868 following his commission. Initially, the French architect Pierre Manguin was in charge of the construction work. In close stylistic reference to the Château de Pontchartrain, Donnersmarck's new residence was built in the neo-baroque style. After Manguin's death (1869), Hector Lefuel, then chief architect of the new Louvre, took over the construction management and completed the new building in 1876. Since then, the Tudor style palace has also been known as the Old Palace. The third and smallest palace, the Cavalier Palace, was built to the south-east of the New Palace until 1906.\nAn Irish engineer called Fox was commissioned to design the 250-hectare park in 1865, based on plans by Peter Joseph Lenné, who died shortly afterwards, and his pupil Gustav Meyer. An English-style landscape park was created, interspersed with groves, small wooded areas and meadows and crossed by small streams with stone and cast-iron bridges. Neudeck thus not only had one of the most magnificent palace complexes, but also one of the largest parks in the German Empire.\nThe place was visited several times by Emperor Wilhelm II, who not only went hunting in the surrounding wooded areas, but also often took loans from the Count. Finally, he elevated Count Guido to the rank of prince (Guido Prince Henckel Fürst von Donnersmarck) for his services. Neudeck was thus also a princely seat. From here, extensive estates with a total area of 27,500 hectares were administered throughout East Central Europe, above all in Upper Silesia (ownership of numerous mines), but also in Austrian Galicia and in Russian-occupied Congress Poland.\n\n\n=== Interwar period ===\nIn 1922, Neudeck fell to Poland after the referendum in Upper Silesia and has since been called Świerklaniec again. However, the Donnersmarcks were able to save their property under Polish rule, as Guido's son Kraft opted for Poland in the referendum. From 1924 to 1937, the former President of the Swiss Confederation Felix Calonder lived in the castle as President of the Mixed Commission for Upper Silesia. His task was to monitor compliance with the German–Polish Convention regarding Upper Silesia as an independent observer.\n\n\n=== Destruction and the post-war period ===\n\nDuring the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Świerklaniec was occupied by German troops, as was the whole of Eastern Upper Silesia. The 316-year reign of the Henckel von Donnersmarck family in Neudeck finally came to an end in 1945. The family was expropriated by the communists and the Old Palace and the New Palace were destroyed by arson by the Red Army at the end of the war. The local population completed the destruction by plundering the interior and devastating the exterior and the park. The two formerly important palaces remained as ruins, which were neither preserved nor rebuilt in the post-war period, but were finally demolished in 1961. Although the Kavalierspalast was also affected in 1945, the damage was limited and it was later rebuilt. Even though the Neudeck castle ensemble is only partially preserved today, the park and the preserved buildings and monuments are very popular as an excursion destination.\n\n\n== Architecture and building history ==\n\n\n=== Park ===\nThe entire palace complex is surrounded by a 154-hectare park; at the time of its creation, it was one of the largest in Germany at around 200 hectares. The Baroque Garden à la française and landscape park, with significant statues by 19th-century artist Emmanuel Frémiet and fountains that survived, is within the former Palace's extensive forested landscape grounds. Two pairs of lion statues survived, now decorating parks in Zabrze and Gliwice, as well as a wrought iron gate currently at the Silesian Zoological Garden in the Katowice and Chorzów districts of Silesia.\n\n\n=== Old palace ===\nThe appearance of the castle until 1945 was due to its reconstruction in the 1840s. Among other things, the irregular, ultimately baroque remodeled complex was given neo-Gothic wings, which formed an outer bailey. Later, two octagonal Tudor-style towers were added and the previously large windows were reduced in size to match the style. This gave it a castle-like character again. However, the count's family only lived in the castle for a few decades and it finally lost its importance in 1875 in favor of the new residence. In 1961, the well-preserved ruins were demolished. Today, there are hardly any remnants of the historic castle left.\n\n\n=== New Palace ===\n\nAlthough the New Palace was only built in the 19th century, it formed the center of the entire complex. The idea for a new palace came from Guido's future wife, Blanka Marquise de Païva, who wanted a new representative palace instead of the old, irregular palace on the edge of the park. The palace was an elongated, magnificent neo-baroque building that was in no way inferior to the great European palaces. Although the palace was later referred to as Little Versailles or Upper Silesian Versailles due to its size, the model for the building was, as mentioned above, the palace in Pontchartrain near Paris, which was also owned by Prince von Donnersmarck from 1857 to 1888. The central section was provided with a high roof and a small lantern on top, thus elevating the north and south wings of the castle. Four higher roofs were added to the sides, which protruded like bay windows. Single-storey pavilions were added to the south and north. A clock and a wrought-iron fence were attached to the west-facing entrance front for guests, forming a semi-circular forecourt. It was interrupted by a high lion-crowned entrance gate (now in Chorzów Zoo). Terraces with balustrades were built on the east side of the park, from which the lake could be reached via steps. These terraces with the water basins and sculptures are the only remains that survived after the demolition in 1961. They give an idea of the splendor of the complex. The remarkable sculptures depict fighting animals and were created by the French sculptor Emmanuel Frémiet.\nStatements about the layout and appearance of the interior can only be made on the basis of descriptions, as no photographs or plans have survived and nothing was documented during the demolition. However, it is known that the castle had 99 rooms, and a brief description of the castle mentions five halls. The most magnificent is said to have been the ballroom with its galleries.\n\n\n=== Cavalier's Palace ===\n\nThe Cavalier's Palace (Pałac Kawalera in Polish and Kavalierspalast in German) is the only secular building to have survived the devastation of 1945. As the last part of the complex, it was built at the beginning of the 20th century as a residence for the younger members of the family and as a guest house in the immediate vicinity of the New Palace. The main reason for the construction was that there was not enough space in the two palaces to accommodate the family's many guests and a guest house was urgently needed.\nThe Berlin architect and court architect Ernst von Ihne was commissioned with the plans, but he had to adhere to the specifications of the count's building commission. The building was erected between 1903 and 1906 in the neo-Renaissance style. The almost square building was constructed from brick, which contrasts with the rich stucco crowning of the window frames and the natural stone parts of the façade. The entrance is formed by an elliptical bay window made of natural stone and decorated with the Henckel von Donnersmarck family coat of arms, preceded by a balcony with arcades\nSince 1992, the building has housed a hotel with a restaurant. Together with the park, the Cavalier's Palace is the main attraction of modern Świerklaniec.\n\n\n=== Funeral chapel ===\nThe preserved neo-Gothic burial chapel of the Donnersmarcks was built between 1895 and 1897 by Julius Carl Raschdorff to the north-east of the old palace. The building is surrounded by canals and centuries-old trees. The graceful neo-Gothic chapel has a rectangular shape and is crowned by a ridge turret. On the north side is a cloister with the adjoining mausoleum itself. An angel of death made of copper is attached to the top of the roof of the square building, symbolizing the function of the building. The many sculptural details include a relief of the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) and several gargoyles. Inside, the old furnishings could not be preserved as the church was plundered after the Second World War. In the following years, the local parish made efforts to take over the burial chapel and bought it in 1947. After overcoming numerous bureaucratic hurdles, the chapel was reconsecrated in 1957 after it had been renovated and refurnished. However, it was not yet saved: Over the next few years, it fell into disrepair again as, for political reasons, it could only be entered for an entrance fee, even by those attending church services, and was therefore hardly used. Later, plans were discussed to demolish the chapel or convert it into a changing room with toilets for a new swimming pool. However, the parish finally managed to renovate the church in three years up to 1983. Today, the chapel serves as a branch church for the local Catholic community.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nDanuta Emmerling u. a.: Górnośląskie Zamki i Pałace.

        "content": "Bakhmut Fortress (Ukrainian: Фортеця Бахмут, romanized: Fortetsia Bakhmut) is a song by the Ukrainian music group \"Antytila\" , dedicated to the city of Bakhmut , the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the entire Ukrainian people who resisted against the Russians during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The composition was released to the general public on February 3, 2023.\nWith this song, the musicians aimed to strengthen the morale of the military defending Ukraine.\n\n\n== Idea and creation ==\nAccording to the musicians, the text of the song was written in just a day by Taras Topolya, and the music was composed by Serhiy Vusyk. Taras Topolya thus described the idea of creating a song:\n\nAs musicians, we understood that we needed to do something inspiring, with which we would want to tear the earth, go into battle, stand and not retreat. But as citizens who have combat experience, we understand that we need to do our work and our task calmly, as we were taught, and that behind our backs, behind the backs of those who are right now with weapons against the occupiers, is the future of Ukraine.\nIn the text, Taras refers to the heroic past of the Ukrainian people, in particular, the participants of the Battle of Kruty in 1918 are mentioned.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe band presented the song on February 3, 2023. This song became the first full-fledged musical work since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Together with the song, the band presented a music video, which showed footage of the destroyed city of Bakhmut.\nOn February 10, the official music video was released, which the band \"Antitila\" filmed for 3 days in real positions during the execution of combat missions near Bakhmut during the Battle of Bakhmut. The basis of the future scenario was proposed by director Kadym Tarasov. The director was Viktor Skuratovskyi . The video shows a combat unit of the 59th howitzer artillery division of the 45th separate artillery brigade, which works with M777 howitzers. According to the authors, the idea of the video clip is that projectiles with quotes from the song written on them are launched by gunners in the direction of the enemy and destroy them with the words from the composition. Also, according to the musicians themselves, a car of the \"Maestro\" medical unit of the 130th Territorial Defense Battalion of the 241st Territorial Defense Brigade, which was used on combat missions by band members when they performed tasks in the war zone, appears in the frame.\nOn February 24, 2023, the musicians presented an acoustic version of this song and a video clip for it. The announcement was accompanied by the following post:\n\nIn memory of the fallen comrades of the 130th TRO battalion, 241st brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the war of liberation against the Russian occupiers. Dedicated to everyone who is on the shield and with the shield. Together with our unit, we performed this song in a new way. In the frame, the native 4th company and combat medics of the \"Maestro\" unit. In the acoustic version, our sorrow for our brothers and respect for them, as well as our determination to take revenge for every broken Ukrainian fate, are heard. The clip was filmed when the battalion was withdrawn from the front line in the Bakhmut direction for recovery. Eternal glory to the Heroes on the shield.\nAs of May 18, 2023, the official music video has amassed 12 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Tell Muhammad (also Tell Mohammed and Tall Muhammad), is an ancient Near East archaeological site currently in the outskirts of Baghdad, along the Tigris river in the Diyala region. It is a very short distance from the site of Tell Harmal to the north and not far from the site of Tell al-Dhiba'i to the northeast. The ancient name of the site is unknown though Diniktum has been suggested. The lost city of Akkad has also been proposed. Based on a year name found on one of the cuneiform tablets the name Banaia has also been proposed.Not to be confused with Tell Mohammed Arab, excavated as part of the Eski Mosul Saddam Dam rescue project in Iraq or Tell Mohammed Diyáb in Syria.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nIts original extent was about 25 hectares, now reduced to about 5 hectares with a maximum height of 2.5 meters. There was six meter wide fortification wall the full extent of which has not been determined. The site, at that time about 6 miles southwest of Baghdad, was excavated by J. F. Jones in 1850. He found several bronze mace heads with an inscription of Hammurabi, ruler of Babylon. The site was examined by A. H. Layard in 1853 who also found mace heads inscribed \"E.GAL ha-am-mu-ra-pi\" - \"(property of) the palace of Hammurabi\". In the early 1900s it was sketched by E. Hertzfeld showing dimensions of 550 meters north to south and 350 meters east to west. In 1957, during an archaeological survey of the region (Adams site #414), it was reported to have been partially destroyed by a modern canal construction. To the northeast there was a large square enclosure (now built over) measuring 900 meters northeast by 900 meters southwest. It was worked for 8 seasons between 1978 and 1985 and again in 1999 by the Iraqi State Antiquities Organization, under the direction of Sd. Mu'tasim Rashid Abdur-Ra. The excavations have revealed remains dating to the Isin-Larsa, Old Babylonian, and Kassite periods.A number of Old Babylonian period cuneiform tablets were found in Levels II and III and are now held at the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad. About 70 of the tablets have been published and are from a private context and record contracts of two generations of a commercial family. Those in Level III carry the old event style date year name formula and those from Level II carry two dates, one of the event style formula and one of the newer date formula. This is thought to represent a transition from Babylonian to Kassite control. The latest tablets carry only a date formula year name.Work at the site has resumed under an University of Catania (Baghdad Urban Archaeological Project) effort led by Nicola Laneri of the University of Sicily with excavation seasons in 2022 and 2023. Before the site was fenced in 2017 it had been used as an unofficial garbage dump and much of the first season involved removing that garbage. Residential, commercial, and water management areas were examined. Finds included three cylinder seals and a number of terracotta plaques, models, a toilet, a funerary chapel, and figurines. One cylinder seal was inscribed with the text \"Awil-Adad, son of La-sani, servant of Sin\".Excavators have determined that the site stratigraphy encompassed 8 levels:\n\nLevels V-VIII - Isin-Larsa - Ur III (late 3rd millennium BC)\nLevel IV - Early Old Babylonian (c. 19th century BC)\nLevel III - Mid-Early Old Babylonian (c. 18th century BC)\nLevel II - Late Old Babylonian (c. 16th - 17th century BC)\nLevel I - Kassite (c, 13th - 15th century BC)where only pottery remains and graves of the Kassite level were found.\n\n\n== History ==\nTell Muhammad was occupied from the Ur III to the Kassite period but is primarily an Old Babylonian period site (the 1957 survey reported Akkadian period pottery but later excavations were unable to replicate that find). Two rulers are known from recovered tablets, Ḫurbaḫ (Ḫurbaḫ/zum) and Šipta-ulzi, both Kassite names. These match the names of early Kassite rulers on the Synchronic King List. They are thought to have ruled at roughly the same time as Samsu-ditāna (c. 1625 – 1595BC), last ruler of First Dynasty of Babylon and Sealand Dynasty rulers Pešgaldarameš and Ayadaragalama. An alternative proposal is to date these Tell Muhammad rulers to the time of the previous ruler of Babylon, Ammi-Saduqa.At Tell Muhammad several tablets, silver loan contracts, were found that were dated with two year names \"Year 38 after Babylon was resettled\" and \"The year that the Moon was eclipsed\". The former year name is of a format used by the Kassites, a change from the event format used through the Old Babylonian period. Attempts have been made to use this eclipse to date the sack of Babylon and its resettlement by the Kassites. Other known year names include \"Year in which the son of Ḫurbaḫ was killed in  Tupliaš\" (mu ša dumu ḫu-ur-ba-aḫ i-na tu-up-li-ia-aš di-kú), \"The year when the son of Hurbah became hostile to the king\" (mu dumu ḫu-ur-ba-aḫ ki lugal ik-ki-ru), and \"Year Ḫurbaḫ restored the gods of Ešnunna\" (MU DINGIR.DIDLI ša áš-nun-naki ḫu-ur-ba-aḫ ú-ud-di-šu).\n\n\n== See also ==\nCities of the ancient Near East\nChronology of the ancient Near East\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAbass, M.H., \"Duqqer and Amulet from Tell Muhammad and Fly Amulets from Ur\", Sumer 52, pp. 152–68, 2003/2004 (in Arabic)\nAl-Khayyat, A.

        "content": "Golden Autumn is a landscape painting by Russian painter Isaak Levitan (1860–1900), completed in 1895. The painting, which measures 82 × 126 cm, is part of the State Tretyakov Gallery's collection in Moscow (Inventory No. 1490). Levitan began working on the canvas in the autumn of 1895, while living in the Gorka estate in the Tver Governorate, where he painted the first sketches. Researchers of the artist's work believe that the painting depicts the Syezha River. It is thought that the work was completed in Moscow at the end of the year.\nThe painting Golden Autumn was exhibited at the 24th exhibition of the Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions ('Peredvizhniki') in February 1896 in Saint Petersburg, and later in March of the same year in Moscow. It was also displayed at the The All-Russia industrial and art exhibition 1896 in Nizhny Novgorod. In that same year, Pavel Tretyakov purchased the painting from the author.\nGolden Autumn belongs to a series of joyous paintings by Levitan created between 1895 and 1897. The series includes other canvases such as March (1895), Fresh Wind. Volga (1895), and Spring. Big Water (1897). This series is considered a characteristic example of the influence of Impressionism on Levitan's work.\nAccording to art historian Alexei Fedorov-Davydov, the painting Golden Autumn \"amazes and captivates with the fullness and beauty of its emotional content, so clearly expressed in the splendour of the colours, in the joyful tone of the golden colouring.\" Art historian Dmitry Sarabianov wrote that the artist was inspired by the \"unusual, striking effect of the colour scheme, in which the contrast between gold and blue plays the leading role.\" According to art historian Faina Maltseva, Levitan's aim in creating Golden Autumn was not only to convey the vibrant autumn colours, but also to show \"such precious features that help us see the image of great integrity and poetry behind this elegant, somewhat decorative form.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background and creation ===\n\nThe painting's creation began in autumn 1895 while Levitan resided in Gorka estate, situated 1.5 kilometres from Ostrovno village in the Vyshnevolotsky Uyezd of Tver Governorate (now part of the Udomelsky District of Tver Oblast). The estate belonged to Privy Councillor Ivan Nikolayevich Turchaninov, a senator and assistant to the governor of Saint Petersburg. His wife, Anna Nikolayevna, frequently visited with their daughters Varvara, Sofya, and Anna.\nLevitan had a romantic relashionship with Anna Nikolaevna Turchaninova, whom he met in the summer of 1894 in Ostrovno. He lived at the Gorka estate in August and September 1894, and returned there in early spring 1895. It was during this time that he painted March. Levitan returned to Moscow at the end of March and stayed in Gorka until early October, with a possible brief return in the second half of October. A two-storey workshop house was built for the artist on the shore of Lake Ostrovno, at the confluence of the Syezhi River, as there were no suitable rooms on the estate. The house was humorously referred to as a 'synagogue'.\nThe painting Golden Autumn is believed to depict the Syezha River. According to some sources, the location chosen by Levitan was only half a kilometre from the Gorka estate. The Syezha River originates from the western part of Lake Udomlya, flows north-west past the Akulovskie hills, and then flows into the south-western end of Lake Ostrovno before continuing northwards. The river's name originates from the verb 'to go down' (Russian: съезжать, romanized: syezzhat'), as it was historically used to go down towards Novgorod. Syezha flows into Uver, Uver into Msta, and Msta into Lake Ilmen, from which the Volkhov River flows through Novgorod.\nArtist Vitold Byalynitsky-Birulya, who also worked in those places, stated that Levitan based his painting Golden Autumn on a sketch made during his stay in Gorka. Art historian Faina Maltseva also believes that Levitan used autumn sketches created in Gorka, while the final version of Golden Autumn was painted in Moscow. According to her, the impression that the landscape was painted from life is due to the painter's \"exceptional visual memory and inspired skill.\" Apparently it was the passionate work on this landscape that led Levitan to refuse the artist Vasily Polenov's offer to visit him at the Borok estate in a letter dated 13 November 1895: \"I was on my way to see you, dearest Vasily Dmitrievich, when suddenly, just suddenly, I was passionately drawn to work; I was carried away, and it has been a week already that I have not broken away from the canvas day in and day out... As I began to work, my nerves became calmer and the world was not so terrible.\"\n\n\n=== 24th traveling exhibition and subsequent events ===\nTogether with nine other works by Levitan, including March, Fresh Wind. Volga, Spring. The Last Snow, Ferns in a Forest, Twilight, Nenuphar and others, the canvas Golden Autumn was exhibited at the 24th exhibition of the Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions ('Peredvizhniki') in Saint Petersburg on 11 February 1896. The exhibition then moved to Moscow in March of the same year. The Saint Petersburg exhibit was held in the building of the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, while the Moscow exhibit was held in the premises of the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture.\nLevitan's exhibited canvases received mixed reviews from critics. In particular, in the note 'The Exhibition of Peredvizhniki', published in the Vsemirnaya Illustratsiya (Vol. 55, No. 1413 for 1896), Vladimir Chuiko praised Levitan for his choice of subjects and his peculiar way of painting, noting that \"almost all his paintings (10 in number) attract attention, with the exception of two: March and Spring, which are too rough and harsh in tone.\" In an article published in the magazine Russkaya Mysl (May 1896 issue), the writer Mitrofan Remezov ironically referred to the entire landscape component of the travelling exhibition, including Levitan's \"'forests' of autumn gold\": in Remezov's words, \"we pay tribute to the artists' skill, but we begin to become indifferent to their works: we have already seen all the 'moods', experienced all the impressions, and are repeating the sensations.\" Petersburgskaya Gazeta published a poetic feuilleton mocking the painting Golden Autumn: \"Ochre dosage very big, / The bold punch of the brush to the canvas, / So much for the 'Golden Autumn', / And 'A gift to the Museum'\". Nevertheless, in most reviews Levitan's works were evaluated positively, which, according to art historian Alexei Fedorov-Davydov, testified to \"the recognition of the artist's talent, the originality of his work and his bright individuality.\"\nIn May 1896, Pavel Tretyakov bought the canvas from the author for 700 rubles, directly from the travelling exhibition, which was still in Moscow at the time. However, the implementation of this transaction was delayed for some reason: the first receipt Levitan received for the painting is dated 10 May, and in a letter dated 29 May he writes that \"yesterday, returning from a trip, met P. M. Tretyakov, who for some reason now thought to buy my painting \"Golden Autumn\", having seen it dozens of times\", and only on 3 June he reported to Tretyakov: \"My painting Golden Autumn has not yet been sold, and therefore I consider it for you. It goes without saying that I am very glad that you wanted it.\" Pavel Tretyakov acquired over twenty works by Levitan for his gallery. The first canvas, Autumn Day. Sokolniki (1879), was purchased in 1880 and also featured autumn themes. March and Golden Autumn were acquired in 1896 and reflected the artist's search for a \"more colourful and decorative palette.\" These works continued \"Levitan's monograph,\" which was established by the founder of the Tretyakov Gallery.\n\nThe painting Golden Autumn was also exhibited at the All-Russia industrial and art exhibition, which opened on 28 May 1896 in Nizhny Novgorod. Levitan himself visited the exhibition, where a total of eighteen of his paintings were displayed. In addition to works from the travelling exhibition, a number of Levitan's works from the late 1880s and early 1890s were presented in Nizhny Novgorod. This was the first wide retrospective display of the artist's work. The 24th travelling exhibition continued its journey to other cities of the Russian Empire in autumn and winter, visiting Kharkiv (October–November), Kyiv (December–January) and Tula (January–February). The exhibition catalogue issued in Kharkiv described the paintings Golden Autumn and March as \"property of the Moscow City Gallery of brothers P. and S. Tretyakovs.\"\nIn Kharkiv, the painting Golden Autumn was damaged when a copper canopy from a wall heater fell on it and tore through the canvas. This incident was reported in a letter dated 22 November 1896 by Georgy (Yegor) Khruslov, the artist and commissioner of the Association for Exhibitions, to Ilya Ostroukhov: \"This morning we had an accident at the exhibition. The paintings had all been taken down from the easels, some were lying on the floor, some were against the walls, all were working at one end of the hall. Suddenly, at the other end, there was a loud bang, I ran there - it turned out that a heavy copper canopy of the calorifier had been torn from the wall and fallen on I. Levitan's painting Golden Autumn, the canvas of the painting was torn through, although the wound is insignificant and it is easy to repair, but considering the fact that the painting belongs to P.M. Tretyakov, I humbly ask the Board to inform me as soon as possible in Kyiv what I should do with the painting...\" In a letter to Khruslov dated 27 November 1896, Ilya Ostroukhov wrote: \"Regarding Levitan's painting, I have sent you a message about sending this thing to Moscow. It will probably be easy to restore it here, as the crack is fresh, but of course it is necessary to see it.\" Subsequently, Dmitry Artsybashev, a restorer from Moscow, skillfully repaired the damage, and it went virtually unnoticed.\n\nIn 1896, Pavel Tretyakov donated the painting he had purchased to the Tretyakov Gallery. The canvas was titled Autumn in the catalogues of 1896 and 1917. Levitan himself was not entirely satisfied with this work, considering it somewhat \"rough\". In the same year, he painted another, less famous painting with the same title - Golden Autumn. This painting is also in the collection of the State Tretyakov Gallery (canvas on cardboard, oil, 52 × 84.6 cm, inv. 5635).\nThe painting Golden Autumn was exhibited at various exhibitions, including Levitan's personal exhibition in 1938 at the State Tretyakov Gallery, and the jubilee exhibition in 1960–1961 in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv. However, it was only displayed in the Moscow part of the exposition. The painting was exhibited in 1971–1972 at 'The Peredvizhniki in the State Tretyakov Gallery' (Moscow) and 'Landscape Painting of the Peredvizhniki' (Kyiv, Leningrad, Minsk, Moscow) exhibitions, which were held to celebrate the centenary of the Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions. The painting Golden Autumn was exhibited at the New Tretyakov Gallery on Krymsky Val as part of the exhibition celebrating the 150th anniversary of Levitan's birth. It was restored specifically for the exhibition and was considered a highlight of the project.\nAn opinion poll of visitors to the Levitan anniversary exhibition, held in Moscow in 2010–2011, was conducted. The poll results show that Golden Autumn ranked sixth among the artist's most popular works, surpassing At the Pool (1892, State Tretyakov Gallery), Over Eternal Peace (1894, State Tretyakov Gallery), March (1895, State Tretyakov Gallery), Quiet Abode (1890, State Tretyakov Gallery) and Evening Bells (1892, State Tretyakov Gallery). The painting Golden Autumn is currently on display in the Levitan Hall (Room No. 37) of the main building of the Tretyakov Gallery in Lavrushinsky Lane.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nLevitan was known for his love of painting autumn landscapes, with over a hundred paintings dedicated to this season. One of his most famous and popular works is Golden Autumn, which portrays a small river surrounded by trees adorned with yellow and red autumn leaves. In the distance, village houses and fields can be seen, with an autumn forest painted in shades of yellow visible on the horizon. Above it all is a blue sky with light clouds floating. The bright, joyful, optimistic colours of this painting are not typical of Levitan's work, which usually features softer and more gentle tones.\nThe artist's perspective is well chosen, allowing for a broad and multidimensional landscape to be depicted. Despite some asymmetry, the painting's composition does not appear unbalanced. The busy left side is compensated for by \"the grouping of objects, distribution of illuminated and shaded masses, and division of plans.\" A group of trees, including birches with bright yellow foliage and aspens with the last reddened leaves, is depicted in close-up at the left edge of the canvas. They create a \"bright and sonorous patch\", which contrasts with the \"slowly flowing, 'cold' river reflecting the coolness of the sky\" to the right, which appears dark and cold. The meadow in the foreground appears to be a single colored patch, although it is actually painted in various shades of green and yellow. These colors are conveyed through small smear marks. Brownish shades can also be seen in some areas. The surface of the river appears to be another large color patch, with the base being blue, to which brownish reflections from the banks are added. Against the background of water, a bush with reddish leaves is clearly visible.\nThe viewer's gaze follows the riverbanks, crossing wide meadows flanked by forests on both sides. In the distance, the eye is drawn to the forests. A lone slender golden-yellow birch stands out on the right bank of the river, with a green foliage forest to its right. The river bends to the left in the distance and disappears from view. This bend enlivens the composition, adding an element of \"coincidence.\" At the edge of the distant forest, where the terrain rises slightly, there are green fields with winter crops and several village houses depicted. Moving further into the depths, the colour gradually softens and changes to a calmer scheme.\nThe painting Golden Autumn shares the main colour components of March, namely yellow, blue, and green. However, the key difference between the two paintings is that March features cooler tones, while Golden Autumn predominantly uses warmer tones. In Golden Autumn, the green colour plays a minor, supporting role, with the main emotional impact coming from the yellow colour. This colour choice \"determines the solemn joyfulness and calm, self-confident beauty\" in the painting.\n\nAnother similarity between March and Golden Autumn is that both paintings are considered to be the best examples of influence of Impressionism on Levitan's work. Like in March, the artist uses Impressionist techniques in Golden Autumn and combines gold and blue colours to create a decorative effect, but in a \"more open and strong manner.\" In Golden Autumn, the brushstroke's expressiveness is of particular importance. This painting showcases even more vigorous and varied brushstrokes than March. The birch tree leaves are painted with thick, expressive strokes, creating a relief-like effect in some areas. Unlike March, Golden Autumn has less glaze, mainly applied to the lower body layer. Dry brushstrokes are repeated in some places, causing them to crumble due to weak connections with the lower layer. In general, the painting Golden Autumn combines traditional painting techniques with a free, almost impressionistic interpretation of individual details. However, it differs from classical impressionism in that the colours do not dissolve in the light but retain their intensity.\n\n\n== Reviews and critique ==\nArt historian Alexei Fedorov-Davydov wrote that the painting Golden Autumn \"amazes and captivates by the fullness and beauty of its emotional content, so clearly expressed in the splendour of colours, in the great sound of the golden colour scale.\" In his opinion, before the appearance of this painting, none of the representatives of Russian landscape painting (including Levitan himself) \"had given such a solemn, joyful in its tranquillity image of autumn, such a depiction of \"lush nature fading away\". According to Fedorov-Davydov, the Golden Autumn canvas is a new, plastically enriched stage of \"landscape mood\", it \"sounds like a song or a poem\", and standing in front of it, we once again realise \"what a poet of nature, what a finely felt and organically expressed poetry of the man Levitan was\".\n\nComparing Golden Autumn with March, painted in the spring of the same year, the art historian Dmitry Sarabianov wrote that in the autumn landscape there was no fragmentariness, that is, \"the feeling of a fragment of nature\", which was inherent in March. According to him, the artist was inspired to create Golden Autumn by the \"unusual, striking effect of the colour scheme, in which the contrast between gold and blue plays the leading role\". At the same time, he noted the natural balance of the composition of the painting, which is \"unfolded towards the viewer and in width\".\nArt historian Olga Lyaskovskaya wrote in her book \"Plein-air in Russian Painting of the XIX century\" that Golden Autumn, unlike March, was not one of Levitan's best works. According to Lyaskovskaya, the whole painting is \"somewhat conventionally, decoratively painted, which is emphasised by the flat white clouds in the bright blue sky\"; she also noted the generalised outlines of the trees and the \"nakedness\" of the colour scheme. Lyaskovskaya also quoted a passage from the memoirs of the artist Boris Lipkin, which showed that Levitan himself was not satisfied with Golden Autumn, saying when it was mentioned: \"Well, it's so crude.\"\nAccording to art historian Faina Maltseva, the image created in this painting \"carries a deep and multifaceted content\", which \"is revealed as you look at what is depicted for a long time, as you empathise with it lyrically\". In the process of such an examination, one can understand that the artist's aim was not only to convey the ornate autumn colours, but also to show \"such precious features that help us to see an image of great integrity and poetry behind this ornate, somewhat decorative form\". According to Maltseva, there is \"nothing accidental\" in the painting, and \"the immediacy of the vital impression\" was achieved through a long search for a suitable composition and the rejection of many unimportant details.\n\nArt historian Vladimir Petrov wrote that Levitan's numerous works dedicated to the Russian autumn \"together form a unique, extremely rich in emotional shades 'autumn suite'\". In his opinion, the most popular of these works is the painting Golden Autumn, which is distinguished by its brightness and particular decorative style. According to Petrov, \"in terms of its heightened sensual tension and condensed perception of nature, this painting does not even seem entirely 'Levitanian'\". He suggests that this style is more in line with the work of later masters, such as painter Stanislav Zhukovsky or writer Ivan Bunin. However, Levitan's \"comprehension of the Russian chord of nature\" is somewhat similar to the frescoes found in Yaroslavl and Rostov churches of the 17th and early 18th centuries.\nIn his discussion of the painting Golden Autumn, writer Vladimir Porudominsky acknowledges the difficulty of describing Levitan's landscapes in words. He notes that a simple enumeration of the elements depicted, such as trees, grass, river, and sky, cannot fully convey the feeling that unites and binds them into a cohesive whole on the canvas. According to Porudominsky, when we look at the bright trunks and flaming leaves of the trees, the blue sky and the cold blue of the river, we feel both the movement of the air \"that rushes into our chests\" and \"the energy that charges us on this warm autumn day\", as well as the sadness that \"the holiday of gold and blue\" will soon be over, and the joyful confidence that after the winter sleep there will be green and blue again, \"because nature lives forever and is always beautiful.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nАрхангельский, Н.А.

Meyer established a Meyer Department Store in Long Beach at 151 Pine St. c. 1905, then re-opened it in 1909 as The Emporium, selling it in 1914.\nMeyer's was founded in 1907 by G. H. and Henry D. Meyer, who until that time had been running a store in Long Beach. In 1919 the store acquired the spaces of the two stores to the north, Mertel's and Brenner & Wood, expanding its store into those spaces.\nH. T. Sundbye, Meyer's brother-in-law, purchased the family's interest in the department store after Henry D. Meyer's passing, and took up the position of general manager of the store.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Catholicosate of Gandzasar or Aghvank (Caucasian Albania) of the Armenian Apostolic Church continued to exist well into the 19th century as a separate diocese of that church. There were attempts by the Church of Caucasian Albania to adopt Chalcedonianism and break with the rest of the Armenian Church so as to be autocephalous in the mid-10th century, but they were suppressed by the Armenian clergy with the support of King Ashot III. After the transfer of the seat of the Armenian patriarch to Rumkale, Cilicia, in the 12th century, the bishops no longer appealed to the former to ordain their Catholicoi. The original order was restored in 1634 after the seat of the Armenian patriarch returned to Etchmiadzin. The See of the Catholicate remained in Partav for a while. Around 1213, it was transferred to the Khamshi Monastery south of Gadabay. Beginning in 1240, the Gandzasar Monastery grew increasingly in importance, and in the 15th century it became the seat of the Aghvank Catholicosate of the Armenian Apostolic Church. From that period on, the Catholicoi also were members of the household of the Armenian princely family of Gandzasar, the House of Hasan-Jalalyan.\nIn addition to jurisdiction of the former Church of Caucasian Albania, the Catholicate maintained control over the Armenian diocese in the Golden Horde in the 13th and 14th centuries, centered in its capital city of Sarai. In the mid-18th century, the religious life of the Armenian community of Astrakhan was also supervised by the Catholicate of Aghvank. Beginning in the early 18th century, the Hasan-Jalalyans actively contributed to the Russian conquest of the South Caucasus. In 1815, two years after the Russian conquest of the Karabakh khanate, the office of the Catholicate was abolished, and its head replaced by a metropolitan bishop. In 1836, under the decree of Nicolas I which regulated the status of the Armenian Apostolic Church within the Russian Empire, the office of the Metropolitan Bishop was abolished completely. Its jurisdictions were subordinated directly to the Armenian Apostolic Church as the Dioceses of Artsakh and Shamakhy, as well as the Vicariate of Ganja within the Armenian Church's Tbilisi Consistory.\n\n\n== References ==",

She was drawn to the church and when she was fourteen she arranged to give a vow of chastity to her priest. She had done well at school and she could speak French and Italian well and she was able to make lace which would offer her an income.\nAt the end of 1877 she joined the \"Twelve Stars of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\" which had been formed to do good works. Two years later St George's assistant priest Giuseppe Diacono created the \"Franciscan Tertiary Teachers\" and in 1881 she was part of what had become a religious community. In 1887 she took the name of Margherita of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. She continued her study of languages learning Greek and English.\nGiuseppe Diacono was dishearted by the finances of the order he had founded and he planned to dissolve it. Margerita would not agree and she proposed to take responsibility for the order and its problems. She succeeded and Giuseppe Diacono took less interest in the group from that time. She was 27 when she became a superior general and she held this role for the next thirty years. During that time she went to Rome where Pope Benedict XV gave his papal \"Decree of Praise\" to her community.\nMargaret was the Superior in the House of Corfu, Greece from 1911 to 1917 and she died on Malta in Rabat in 1952. In 2014 the Pope agreed that she should be declared Venerable which is a step towards beatification.\n\n\n== References ==",

It shows him seated on a bench with a football on his knee.The work was funded by Waltham Forest Council at a cost of £7,200 in 2019 and 2020. Several locations were explored for the statue and it remained in storage while a location could be agreed upon. It was originally to be sited at Chingford railway station, but this was rejected following a risk assessment by Transport for London. A plan to place it in Ridgeway Park was also rejected.The first pictures of the statue were obtained by the street newspaper, The Big Issue in 2024. The images were met with some criticism with some questioning whether a footballer should be sitting on a bench in the way portrayed while others made fun at its brown, chocolate appearance.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "earliest_creation_date": null,
        "content": "Starscourge Radahn (also called General Radahn) is a fictional character from the 2022 action role-playing video game Elden Ring developed by FromSoftware. A demigod, he functions as both a prominent figure in the history of the game's fictional universe, the Lands Between, and one of its main bosses. Radahn is encountered in Caelid, a once-verdant area that has been reduced to a red, highly-toxic wasteland by a fellow demigod, Malenia the Severed, in a last-ditch effort to defeat him.\nKnown by the epithet \"Conqueror of the Stars\", Radahn was formerly one of the most powerful warriors in the game's universe, able to halt the stars themselves in place using gravitational magic. During the Shattering, an immense conflict for control of the shards of the Elden Ring, Radahn battled Malenia to a standstill in the Caelid wilds. While the battle was ultimately a draw, with Malenia incapacitated, Radahn was rendered mindless after he was infected with Scarlet Rot, both a crippling toxin and an Outer God contained within Malenia. Contemporaneous to the game's events, Radahn has been reduced to a wandering, cannibalistic husk, with warriors attempting to defeat him and preserve his honor through the regular Radahn Festival.\nDefeating Radahn, while optional, is required for the player to obtain one of the game's Great Runes, shards of the Elden Ring necessary to proceed the storyline. It is also needed for the optional quest of Ranni the Witch, who requires the stars to begin moving again in order to fulfill her destiny. Radahn's lore and boss fight were praised by critics, who were impressed by the scale of the fight and Radahn's tragic backstory, calling him one of the game's best bosses and characters, and the Radahn Festival one of the game's most memorable events.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nStarscourge Radahn was the child of Radagon - a red-haired champion of the game's Golden Order faction, who worship the Outer God known as the Greater Will - and Rennala, queen of the Carians, a group of moon-worshiping nobles and astrologers predating the Elden Ring who draw power from the stars. Due to this, he is the brother of the demigods Lunar Princess Ranni - later called Ranni the Witch - and Praetor Rykard. Radagon and Rennala's marriage cemented an alliance between the Golden Order and Carian nobles, who had previously been deadlocked in battle.\nWhile Radagon resented his red hair as being similar to that of the Giants and their Fell God, who had once posed the greatest threat to the Golden Order, Radahn viewed it as a positive, believing it indicative of heroic qualities. Despite following in Radagon's footsteps as a powerful general, Radahn also studied in Sellia, a town of sorcery located in Caelid. After realizing he was growing to a giant size and would be forced to abandon his beloved steed, Leonard, he chose to study gravitational magic under the tutelage of the Alabaster Lords, a race of humanoid, extraterrestrial beings. This ultimately allowed him to lower his weight to almost nothing, and continue to ride Leonard despite dwarfing the  horse in size. \nDue to the constant threat of meteors bringing monsters to the Lands Between such as the Fallingstar Beasts, Radahn used his gravity magic to \"challenge the stars\", succeeding in a \"crushing victory\" and halting their movement entirely. This remains the case even when Radahn has long since lost his mind, and his death is required to restore their normal movement. Upon the advent of the Shattering, a war following the attempted destruction of the Elden Ring, Radahn may have lost control of the capital of Leyndell to the demigod Morgott and retreated to Caelid. Malenia marched from the Mountaintops of the Giants and into Caelid to confront Radahn, a major potential threat. The two of them fought to a draw, causing Malenia to resort to unleashing her curse of Scarlet Rot. Radahn was poisoned by Scarlet Rot so deeply that he lost his mind, and Caelid itself became a wasteland.\nRadahn can be slain by the Tarnished player character during the Radahn Festival with the potential assistance of various other NPCs, and his Great Rune claimed by the player. This immediately causes the stars to snap back into position, allowing fate to resume for Ranni the Witch, and results in a large meteor impact that unlocks an underground city.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDuring Radahn's second-phase meteor attack, Radahn pushes his horse Leonard underground as a protective measure. However, datamining revealed that Leonard also continues to track the player while underground, allowing Radahn to precisely target his meteor attack to hit the player. A \"cheese\", or easy strategy discovered by players allowed them to instantly kill Radahn by standing adjacent to a cliff, causing Radahn to undershoot them and fall off the side of the arena when performing his meteor strike.\nA 2022 patch to the game \"nerfed\", or lowered the power of Radahn to make his fight less challenging. However, the sheer degree of difficulty lowering was unintended, and a subsequent patch restored some, but not all of his former power.\nThe game's director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, stated that Radahn was his favorite character, citing both Radahn as a person and the festive feeling of defeating him. He noted that he came up with the idea of the Radahn Festival, but the other developers did not take him seriously.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIan Walker of Kotaku called Radahn the game's best character, and potentially one of the greatest Souls characters of all time, citing both Radahn's \"touching\" and \"awe-inspiring\" backstory, as well as the way his battle changes the game's world. Saying that his current form is \"a pale facsimile\" of the brilliant general he formerly was, he called Radahn's reasoning for learning gravity magic - to continue riding his prized horse, Leonard - \"adorable\". While calling the normal Radahn fight \"incredibly challenging\", Walker suggested that players make use of the other characters available to be summoned for the fight, saying that it is not only thematically appropriate but makes the fight a \"cakewalk\". He also praised the fact that Radahn's defeat added a \"permanent geological feature\" to the game's map, allowing the player passage to the city of Nokron.\nDescribing Radahn as \"everything I look for in a Souls boss\", with \"weird and heartbreaking\" lore and a \"unique experience\" with a challenge that can be scaled by the player's choices, he called it \"incredible that, 13 years after Demon’s Souls first released, FromSoftware can still create characters that have this much of an impact\".\nJames Troughton of TheGamer also praised the Radahn fight, saying that few games had captured the excitement of adventurers banding together in a similar way as the Radahn Festival. Describing it as the game's \"Dunharrow moment\" in reference to The Lord of the Rings, he was surprised that the battle with Radahn was not the endgame, but rather only the game's midpoint. He called the fight \"the sum of your journey up until this point\", and the culmination of the player's journey through the \"treacherous, inhospitable wasteland\" of Caelid. \nSimilarly, Robert Zak of DualShockers noted that the Radahn battle broke the rules of Souls fights to that point, saying that it was the moment he most wished his non-Elden Ring-playing friends got to experience. Citing the Radahn Festival's buildup to facing him in battle, he called it \"the only time I recall in a Soulsborne game that everything feels almost normal\", also noting that the pre-fight cutscene took the player out of their own perspective to depict Radahn. Continuing to the fight itself, Zak said that it \"indulges in spectacle like no other Souls fight\", even at the expense of challenge, starting with \"immense arrow volleys\" that were nonetheless easy to avoid, and continuing with \"the total headfuck where he jumps into the sky (taking the music with him), then crashes down on you in the form of a giant meteor\", elevating the battle to a \"cosmic scale\". Zak called the act of \"summoning your pals in as you’re initially charging across the battlefield\" a \"transcendent\" moment. While noting the boss was not the hardest in the game, he criticized fans who would call Radahn a poor boss due to a lack of difficulty, saying that \"everyone’s free to set their own criteria for what a good boss fight is\".\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "United States, et al. v. Apple is a lawsuit brought against multinational technology corporation Apple Inc. in 2024. The United States Department of Justice alleges that Apple violated antitrust statutes. The lawsuit contrasts the practices of Apple with those of Microsoft in United States v. Microsoft Corp., and alleges that Apple is engaging in similar tactics and committing even more egregious violations. This lawsuit comes in the wake of Epic Games v. Apple and the enforcement of the Digital Markets Act in the European Union.\n\n\n== History and background ==\nIn a press conference, the US Attorney General Merrick Garland made reference to the 30% \"Apple Tax\", criticized iMessage's \"Green Bubbles\", and called out the lack of NFC access for 3rd party banking apps.Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter stated United States v. Microsoft Corp. \"paved the way for Apple to launch iTunes, iPod and eventually the iPhone\", and that this new suit will “protect competition and innovation for the next generation of technology.”The case was initially set to be overseen by judge Michael E. Farbiarz until he recused himself on April 10, 2024. Judge Julien Neals became the sitting judge on the case in his absence.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Rewilding Argentina (Spanish: Fundación Rewilding Argentina) is an Argentine nonprofit conservation organization. It purchases private land, restoring ecosystems and developing wildlife corridors, then donates the land for national parks. The organization also reintroduces native species. Founded in 2010 by Argentine conservationists, Rewilding Argentina was preceded by Conservation Land Trust, which was established by Doug Tompkins in 1992.\nRewilding Argentina has donated land that led to the creation or expansion of six national parks, two provincial parks, and one national reserve in Argentina. Among the parks expanded or created through Rewilding Argentina are Monte León National Park, El Impenetrable National Park, Perito Moreno National Park, Patagonia National Park, Aconquija National Park, Iberá National Park, Cueva de las Manos Provincial Park, and the Iberá Provincial Reserve.\nThrough its rewilding efforts, Rewilding Argentina manages reintroduction projects for 14 species, including giant river otters, giant anteaters, Pampas deer, lowland tapirs, collared peccaries, jaguars, red-and-green macaws, and bare-faced curassows. Rewilding Argentina also works with communities adjacent to national parks to establish ecotourism.\n\n\n== Background and history ==\nSince the European colonization of the Americas, Argentina has experienced massive biodiversity loss and defaunation related to pressures placed on the environment by overexploitation and cattle ranching. In northern Argentina, populations of giant anteaters, giant river otters, jaguars, red-and-green macaws, Pampas deer, pumas, and maned wolves dwindled or disappeared completely.\n\nDoug Tompkins, a U.S. businessperson and the founder of outdoor company The North Face, founded the Conservation Land Trust in 1992 and began purchasing large tracts of land that could be used to establish national parks. The donation of a parcel of land led to the formation of the Corcovado National Park in Chile in 1994. National park officials in Argentina invited Tompkins and his wife Kris Tompkins, former CEO of the outdoor company Patagonia, to visit the Iberá Wetlands in 1997. That year, Conservation Land Trust Argentina purchased the San Alonso Ranch, a 11,400 ha (28,000-acre) island in the wetlands.\nIn 2004, Conservation Land Trust donated land to the Argentine government that was later used to form the Monte León National Park in Santa Cruz Province. By 2007, Conservation Land Trust Argentina had acquired an additional 142,000 ha (350,000 acres) for restoration and conservation projects. Additional swamp land and former ranches were purchased, and by 2010, the organization had acquired 765,000 ha (1,890,000 acres) of land in Chile and Argentina.\nRewilding Argentina was founded in 2010 by Argentinian conservationists as a spin-off of the non-profit organization Tompkins Conservation, which serves as a project partner. The nonprofit organization purchases large tracts of privately owned land, restores them, then donates the land to the Argentine government, ensuring that the land is preserved as a national park. Argentine biologist Sofia Heinonen is the executive director of Rewilding Argentina.\n\n\n== Establishment of national parks ==\nThe efforts of Rewilding Argentina and its counterpart in Chile have led to the establishment or enlargement of 15 national parks in Argentina and Chile, protecting 6,000,000 ha (15,000,000 acres). By 2022, the organization had donated $400 million to conservation efforts and had donated around 400,000 ha (990,000 acres) of land, with \"an estimated market value of US$91 million\". In Argentina, the organization's land donations have resulted in the enlargement and creation of six national parks, two provincial parks, and one national reserve. The lands comprise over 10% of the land managed by the National Parks Administration of Argentina.\nBy 2003, Doug Tompkins had acquired 110,074 ha (272,000 acres) of land in the Iberá wetlands. Rewilding Argentina purchased several private ranches in the wetlands and managed them as private reserves, eradicating non-native species, creating wildlife corridors, removing hundreds of kilometers of fences, and implementing prescribed burns. Rewilding Argentina worked with the Corrientes government to elevate the legal status of the provincial reserve to a provincial park in 2009, ensuring that the land could not be sold by the government.\n\nThe donation of the 37,500-acre (15,200 ha) El Rincón Ranch in Santa Cruz Province in 2013 enlarged the size of Perito Moreno National Park. The creation of the 128,000 ha (320,000-acre) El Impenetrable National Park in 2014 was made possible through the donation of La Fidelidad Ranch. In 2015, Rewilding Argentina donated land that led to the establishment of Patagonia National Park in Santa Cruz Province. In 2018, the organization donated land that became the Aconquija National Park in Tucumán Province. In 2018, 151,757 ha (375,000 acres) of land was donated to the Argentine government and the Iberá National Park was created. The Cambyretá Wild Nature Reserve was established in 2019. In 2019, Rewilding Argentina donated land for the creation of the Cueva de las Manos Provincial Park, which contains the rock art site Cueva de las Manos in Santa Cruz Province. In 2021, Rewilding Argentina donated over 50,000 ha (120,000 acres) to increase the size of the Iberá Provincial Reserve.\nRewilding Argentina also assisted in the passage of legislation in Argentina that led to the creation of two national marine reserves, the Yaganes Marine National Park and the Namuncurá-Burdwood Bank II Marine National Park.\nIn 2022, Rewilding Argentina was part of a coalition that created the Península Mitre Natural Protected Area in Mitre Peninsula that complements the Tierra del Fuego National Park.\n\n\n== Rewilding and species reintroduction ==\n\nIn addition to habitat restoration, Rewilding Argentina manages multispecies rewilding projects throughout Argentina, including in the Iberá wetlands, the forests of Chaco, the southern coast, and the Patagonian Steppe. The organization spends US$3 million annually on nature restoration.\nRewilding Argentina emphasizes the reintroduction of keystone species, including large predators, to restore ecosystem function through trophic cascading. Many large vertebrates in Argentina, such as giant anteaters, lowland tapirs, giant river otters, jaguars, and peccaries were mostly hunted to extinction. Rewilding Argentina acquires animals from wildlife shelters and zoos. It implements quarantine protocols and captive breeding programs, eventually releasing the animals into reserves. Rewilding Argentina makes use of camera traps and satellite collars to monitor the reintroduced species and to document animal presence and predator-prey dynamics. For pumas, the rewilding teams engage in \"capture campaigns\" to find and capture the animals. Once fitted with GPS collars, the pumas are tracked using the Iridium satellite constellation.\nRewilding Argentina has introduced giant anteaters, pampas deer, and collared peccaries. Collared peccaries were reintroduced in 2015 and the lowland tapir was reintroduced the following year. As of 2022, the organization has projects focused on reintroducing 14 distinct species, including founding populations of bare-faced curassows, red-and-green macaws, coypus, Wolffsohn's viscachas, and jaguars. Rewilding Argentina has developed a model for reintroducing keystone species it calls the Full Nature Model, which was formalized by Ignacio Jiménez Pérez in 2018.\nThe rewilding team of the Conservation Land Trust reintroduced giant anteaters to the Iberá wetlands in 2007. A giant anteater named Yvoty Porá (Guarani: Pretty Flower) was the first reintroduced species in Corrientes. The anteater had been orphaned due to wildlife trafficking and had been living on the patio of a home in Palpalá, Jujuy. Following her release she had seven offspring and lived to the age of 15. By 2022, there were hundreds of giant anteaters in five population centers across Iberá. Two of the populations are self-sustaining.\n\nRewilding Argentina has reintroduced giant river otters sourced from European zoos. Three giant river otter cubs were born in the Iberá wetlands in May 2021.\nPampas deer were translocated from the northern portion of the Iberá Provincial Reserve from 2009 to 2012 and from 2015 and 2019. They were reintroduced following a period of acclimatization and two self-sustaining populations now exist in Iberá.\nThe reintroduction of red-and-green macaws involved the construction of an aviary that has a stuffed, remote-controlled fox to help the birds learn to not feed on the ground. Only one of the seven birds that were initially released in 2015 survived, likely due to poor antipredation skills. Following improved training techniques, an additional 43 macaws were released between 2016 and 2022. Reintroduction efforts involved planting 100 pindó palms (Syagrus romanzoffiana) as food sources for the macaws. Pre-release aviaries were also constructed for bare-faced curassows and nine individuals were reintroduced in 2020.\n\nRewilding Argentina started a project for reintroducing jaguars in 2010. Construction of the Jaguar Reintroduction Center on San Alonso Island in Iberá commenced in 2012. Jaguars had been extinct in Corrientes Province since the 1930s due to hunting and habitat loss. Individual jaguars were sourced from wildlife shelters and South American zoos, with the first arriving in 2015. In 2018 the first two jaguar cubs were born in Corrientes. The first jaguars were released into Iberá Park in 2021 with Iridium GPS collars. As of 2022, a population of 12 jaguars is thought to exist in the wetlands, feeding on feral hogs and capybaras.\nRewilding Argentina has also attempted to reintroduce guanacos to the Pampas region. A population of 45 translocated from Southern Patagonia was approved by the Ministry of Environment.\nAs of 2022, Rewilding Argentina also has plans for reintroduction projects for red-legged seriemas (Cariama cristata) and lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca).\n\nIn 2022, Rewilding Argentina signed an agreement with the government of Jujuy Province to restore native wildlife. The initial collaboration resulted in the transfer of five collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) and an ocelot (Leopardus pardalis). To facilitate the reintroduction of ocelots to the Iberá Wetlands, a pre-release corral complex was created to help them adapt to the wild and develop hunting skills.\nIn April 2023, the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development approved the import of three Chilean huemuls to the Patagonian Desert in Argentina. At a meeting of the National Parks Administration in June 2023, a proposed project by Rewilding Argentine to relocate swamp deer from Iberá to El Impenetrable National Park was determined to be unviable.\n\n\n== Community relations ==\n\n\n=== Capacity building and ecotourism ===\nIn conjunction with reintroductions of species, Rewilding Argentina works with rural communities in establishing a restoration economy with an emphasis on ecotourism and capacity building. The organization has focused on developing trails, campsites and infrastructure for nature tourism. Additionally, Rewilding Argentina has established \"gateways\" to nature preserves in adjacent communities. Local people have transitioned to jobs as tour guides and park rangers. The establishment of a Northern Ecotourism Corridor was backed by then-President Mauricio Macri and the Minister of Tourism.\n\n\n=== Concerns about foreign investors and species introductions ===\nThe initial purchases of land by Doug Tompkins led to rumors that he worked for the CIA, or was buying up water resources or land for a secret military installation. In response to the speculation, Conservation Land Trust reframed their species introduction efforts as \"nature production\", resulting in a product that would attract tourism. The land trust blended its organizational goals with the Gaucho culture of Corrientes to connect rewilding efforts to local pride and heritage.\nOpposition from people worried about a foreign organization owning land in Argentina was diffused when Rewilding Argentina donated the lands to the government. Nonetheless, the prospect of restoring jaguars to a cattle-ranching region was met with skepticism by locals. Ranchers have also opposed the reintroduction of guanacos and pumas.\nIn an ecocritical article in Green Letters, Soledad Altrudi called attention to the process of habituating pumas for ecotourism, writing that it is \"predicated on controlling future animal behavior\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nConservación Patagónica\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nRewilding Argentina, Talk to Al Jazeera: In the Field (video)",

This was on the same day as other local elections. 60 of the 60 seats are up for election.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSince its creation in 1974, Walsall has varied between the Conservatives and Labour. Between 1973 and 2004, Walsall had been under Labour control from 1973 to 1976, 1980 to 1982, 1988 to 1992, 1995 to 1996, and 1999 to 2000. It was then under Conservative control between 2004 and 2011, before reverting to no overall control and being retaken by the Conservatives in 2019. In the 2023 elections, the Conservatives retained all 13 seats up for election, receiving 46.1% of the vote, Labour gained 1 seat with 40.9%, and the Liberal Democrats received 4.7%. Despite only standing in 9 of the 20 wards, Reform UK received 3.1%, performing best in Birchills-Leamore, where they received 12.6% of the vote.\nThis election will be an all-out election following boundary changes.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Thayre (fl. 1603–1625) was an English medical writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThayre describes himself as a ‘chirurgian’ in July 1603; but as his name does not occur among the members of the Barber-Surgeons' Company, and as he uses no such description in 1625, he was probably one of the numerous irregular practitioners of the period, and no sworn surgeon. He published in London in 1603 a ‘Treatise of the Pestilence,’ dedicated to Sir Robert Lee, lord mayor 1602–3. The cause of the disease, the regimen, drugs and diet proper for its treatment are discussed. Ten diagnostic symptoms are described, and some theology is intermixed. The general plan differs little from that of Thomas Phaer's ‘Treatise on the Plague,’ and identical sentences occur in several places [see Phaer, Thomas]. These passages have suggested the untenable view (Catalogue of the Library of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society of London, ii. 439) that the works are identical, and Thayre a misprint for Phayre. A similar resemblance of passages is to be detected in English books of the sixteenth century on other medical subjects, and is usually to be traced to several writers independently adopting and slightly altering some admired passage in a common source. Thayre published a second edition in 1625, dedicated to John Gore, lord mayor 1624–5. The work shows little medical knowledge, but preserves some interesting particulars of domestic life, and, though inferior in style to the writings of Christopher Langton and even of William Clowes, contains a few well-put and idiomatic expressions.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1898). \"Thayre, Thomas\".

        "content": "\"Binibini\" (lit. 'Young Woman') is a song by Filipino singer-songwriter Zack Tabudlo from his debut studio album, Episode (2021). It was released for streaming on March 26, 2021, via Island Records Philippines and UMG Philippines. Written and produced by Tabudlo, the Tagalog lyrics symbolize love as a dance, and tells of feelings and first times, showing the whole cycle of romance, including heartbreak.\nThe song was a commercial success, as it made it into the top of local Spotify Philippines charts. It broke the record for the longest-running number 1 local track by a Filipino RADAR artist on the Philippines Top 50 Chart with six weeks, and gained global footing by topping the charts for four consecutive weeks on Global Viral.\nA music video was released on April 12, 2021. Later that year, a remix, \"Binibini (Last Day On Earth)\", was released as a duet with James TW and features rewritten English lyrics.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Binibini\" is a kundiman tune with a length of 3 minutes and 41 seconds. It features a sound of 1990s alternative rock in the bridge, where it incorporates alternative rock-styled guitar effects and melodies, according to Manilla Bulletin, who believed it accompanies the track's vibe very well. The publication also thought it had a \"modern singer-songwriter flair\" that created the song's \"uniquely arresting sound\".\nIn a press release, Tabudlo revealed that he had written ‘Binibini’ at the peak of a romantic relationship with a former lover. He said \"She was the binibini that I would dance with in the middle of the rain, in the middle of a chaos, or whatever’s happening around us.” He likened the song to the mutual connection between two persons romantically swept away with each other, but are “waiting for the right moment to say what they feel.”\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nRolling Stone featured the song in its \"10 Songs From International Hitmakers You Should Have on Your Radar\".\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nIn 2021, \"Binibini\" broke the record for the longest-running number 1 local track by a Filipino RADAR artist (an international program for emerging artists) on the Spotify Philippines' Top 50 Chart with six weeks, and gained a global audience by topping the charts for four consecutive weeks on Global Viral. In a few months, it had amassed 18.3 million streams on Spotify. It also entered the Spotify Viral charts of five foreign countries, namely Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. It ended 2021 as Spotify Wrapped's Most Streamed Song in the Philippines.\nOn February 15, 2022, Billboard launched the Philippines Songs chart as part of its Hits of the World collection, in which \"Binibini\" debuted at number 13. It then peaked at number 9 on the week dated April 16. \"Binibini\" charted for 18 weeks in total, making its last appearance on the week ending on June 18, 2022.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video for \"Binibini\" was directed by Dan Villegas and premiered on April 12, 2021. It stars Seth Fedelin and Andrea Brillantes as a young couple about to break up. Together, they relive the moments they've shared throughout the relationship as time rewinds all the way back to the day they first met. This includes a scene in which the lovers dance in the rain. Throughout the video, Tabudlo performs in heavy rain symbolizing his own experiences with a previous lover.\nThe music video topped the YouTube Trending charts for several weeks. As of March 21, 2024, the music video has 45 million views on YouTube.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\n\"Binibini\" has been covered by grentperez and the a cappella group Filharmonic.\n\n\n=== James TW version ===\nIn April 2021, James TW, known for his hit single “When You Love Someone”, released a cover of \"Binibini\" on TikTok. Tabudlo then shared the cover, leading to a collaboration between them, as they also shared the same label, Island Records. On June 7, 2021, Tabudlo shared a clip on Twitter of their collaboration. On June 11, \"Binibini (Last Day on Earth)\" was released, with rewritten English lyrics.\n\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits are adapted from UMG Philippines.\n\nZack Tabudlo – lead vocals, backing vocals, producer, mixing engineer, mastering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBinibini (Official Lyric Video) on YouTube\nBinibini (Official Music Video) on YouTube",

The Saints competed in the ECAC North and played their home games at Alumni Recreation Center. They finished the season 23–6, 16–2 in NAC play to capture the regular season championship. As the No. 1 seed, they were upset in the quarterfinals of the ECAC North tournament by New Hampshire. As a conference champion and No. 1 seed who failed to win their conference tournament, they received an automatic bid to the National Invitation Tournament where they lost to Boston College in the first round.\n\n\n== Schedule and results ==\nSource\n\nAll times are Eastern\n\n\n== References ==",

It is the remains of a Type Ia supernova. \nIt is 4,500 years old, and is older than normal supernova remnants.\n\n\n== Description ==\nG299.2-2.9 gives astronomers an opportunity to study how supernova remnants evolve and warp over time. G299.2-2.9 also provides a glimpse of the explosion that produced it. G299.2-2.9 is split into several distinct and different regions: an almost complete bubble interrupted only by a blow-out, a bright center, a complex \"knot\" region on the northeastern edge of the bubble structure and a diffuse emission extending beyond the main structure. It has been heavily documented by multiple satellites and in-orbit telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Telescope, and Chandra..\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe small X-ray emission from the deep portions of G299.2-2.9 shows large quantities of iron and silicon, which indicates that it is a remnant of a Type Ia supernova. The outer \"shell\" is large and complex, with a multi-shell structure. Outer shells similar to G299.2-2.9 are usually not associated with exploded stars..\n\n\n== Research ==\nSince theories about Type Ia supernovae assume they go off in a specified environment, detailed studies of the outer \"shell\" of G299.2-2.9 have helped astronomers improve their understanding of the areas and situations where thermonuclear explosions occur.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Galway Greyhound Stadium formerly Galway Sportsgrounds, is the home of greyhound racing in Galway. The operators, Greyhound Racing Ireland host race fixtures throughout the year, primarily on Friday and Saturday evenings and the race distances are 350, 525, 550, and 575 yards. The feature competition at the track is the Champion Bitch Stake. The grass pitch inside the greyhound track is used by Connacht Rugby and when rugby union is held the stadium is known as the Dexcom Stadium for sponsorship purposes.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Galway Greyhound Racing Company was established in 1929 but it took a further three years for the first greyhound racing to take place at the west coast venue on the west side of the Lough Atalia. The opening night was slightly delayed before finally taking place on 1 July 1932. The first Racing Manager was Eugene Kelly. The company was set up with £2,000 of capital by the directors Joseph Young, Henry Anderson, Martin Brennan, C.J. Kerin, John D.Whelan, M.J.Lydon, Thomas McDonagh, Philip O'Gorman, Jeremiah O'Sullivan. J.J. Flavin and Martin McDonagh.\nAfter a successful first season, the track re-opened for 1933, with significant improvements having taken place at the 'Sports Field', including a cover added to the main stand. In 1935, the Galway Greyhound Owners' Association was formed. In 1937, Mr Pat White was appointed the new manager of the track after switching from Enniscorthy Greyhound Stadium.\nThe stadium operated through the majority of World War II and was a very popular destination, drawing in large attendances, partly due to the lack of other entertainment during the period. By 1946, the track was holding five meetings per week, overseen by Racing Manager M.A Cunningham and some races offered £300 for the win (a significant amount at the time).\nIn 1959, a dispute over rent increases arose between directors of the greyhound racing and the Galway Sports Society, who owned the grounds and threatened to end the greyhound racing. Edward 'Ned' Shea replaced Martin Divilly as track manager in 1960 and Micheál Ó Droigheaín, another former Galway track manager died in 1964. Another problem arose in 1974, when the track was closed over ownership issues. The issue was that the Galway Agricultural & Sports Society wished to sell the racing licence to the Bord na gCon and refused to let the Galway Racing Company operate (the Galway Racing Company had held the licence since 1932). It finally resulted in the track being taken over by the Bord na gCon in October 1974.\nBy 1978, the stadium required renovation and the Bord na gCon decided that improvements could only be completed with the closure of the greyhound track. Therefore, in 1978 a new stand with bars and tote facilities was built and the circuit itself was re-laid with increased cambers. The grand re-opening was on 25 May 1979, with the modernisation costing over £500,000. \nIn March 1998, the track was converted to sand from grass but the owners and breeders were frustrated at the funding levels by the Bord na gCon. In 2003, the track was subject to a major renovation project that cost the Bord na gCon €6m. The project was overseen by Racing Manager Ollie Hester, who joined the track in 2000.\nIn recent years the stadium has raced on the Friday and Saturday evenings and was also subject to criticism over attendance figures, which were distorted by TV requirements.\n\n\n== Track records ==\nCurrent\n\nFormer\n\n\n== Rugby Union ==\n\n\n== References ==",

Its current name could refer to the fact that the village is built on a high sand ridge, known as a geest. The Church of Tergast was built on the highest point of this ridge somewhere in the second half of the 13th century.\nThe Emden municipal waterworks with several reservoirs is located in Tergast.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nHabbo Gerhard Lolling (1848–1894), archaeologist\n\n\n== References ==",

He then went to London, but, meeting with little encouragement as a practitioner, he for a time served as writing-master in a boarding-school at Tottenham, and subsequently became a dispensing assistant to Timothy Bevan, the druggist. About 1765 his uncle, Gilbert Thompson of Penketh, died and left him 4,000l. He then commenced work as a physician in the city, and eventually attained to a fair practice. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 25 June 1770. He died at his house in Salter's Court, Cannon Street, 1 January 1803. He was a quaker, and is represented as a man of great integrity, of mild and unassuming manners, and possessed of considerable learning and professional skill. He was an intimate friend of the physician, John Fothergill. He is said to have been secretary to the Medical Society of London for several years, but there is no entry to this effect in the books of the society; he was a member, and was present at the first meeting in May 1773.\nHis works were:\n\n‘Disputatio Medica Inauguralis de Exercitatione,’ Edinburgh, 1753, 4to.\n‘A Biographical Memoir of the Life and a View of the Character of the late Dr. Fothergill,’ London, 1782, 8vo.\n‘Select Translations from Homer and Horace, with original Poems,’ London, 1801, 8vo.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Webb, William Wilfrid (1898). \"Thompson, Gilbert\".

        "content": "Bárbara Plaza Hernández (26 October 1976 – 24 August 2003) was a former Spanish rhythmic gymnast. She was a World and European medalist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShe started rhythmic gymnastics in 1985 when she was 8 years old, joining the Atzar Club in Valencia. In 1990 she was third in the senior category of the Spanish Championships held in Palencia.\nIn 1991 she was incorporated into the national team, participating in the Junior European Championships in Lisbon where she won team bronze along  Carolina Borrell, Rosabel Espinosa and the substitute Peligros Piñero. In November 1991, as a senior individual, he won team gold and silver in the All-Around at the IV Ibero-American Gymnastics Games in Curitiba.\nIn April 1992 she was 4th at nationals and in July she won team, All-Around and hoop's gold, as well as silver with ball, rope and clubs, at the Ibero-American Gymnastics Games. In mid-1992 she became part of the group, after being called by coach Emilia Boneva because shortly before the World Championships in Brussels, the team's gymnasts Teresa Fuster and Isabel Gómez were injured. Bárbara did not compete in the 1992 Olympic Games because rhythmic gymnastics was an individual-only sport at the Olympics at that time, although she participated with the rest of her teammates in the opening ceremony, leading the parade of participating nations.\nFuster and Gómez's injuries led to a change in the group's lineup: remaining both as alternates and being replaced by Barbara, Alicia Martin and Cristina Martinez. The three would be joined by Deborah Alonso, Lorea Elso, Montserrat Martin and Gemma Royo. In Brussels the group won silver in the All-Around, with their score just one tenth of a point away from allowing them to retain the world title they had won the previous year. In addition, on November 22 they won bronze in the 6 ribbons final and were 8th with 3 balls and 3 ropes.\nIn 1993, Ana Roncero became national head coach and María Fernández Ostolaza joined as coach of the group. After many of the previous group members retired Bárbara, Carolina Borrell, Cristina Martínez, Maider Olleta, Alicia Martin and Pilar Rodrigo, with María Álvarez, Regina Guati, Lorena Barbadillo, Paula Cabo and Eva Velasco as substitutes, constituted the new national group. At the European Championships in Bucharest, the Spanish group won the bronze medal in the All-Around and with 4 hoops & 4 clubs, taking 6th place with 6 ropes. She retired after the European Championships.\nAfter her retirement in 1993, she dedicated herself to working as a coach at her former club, Club Atzar in Valencia. She died on August 24, 2003, in a motorcycle accident. On October 9, 2004, a tribute was held in her honor.\n\n\n== References ==",

According to Endeavour Mining, the Houndé Mine employs approximately 1,860 people. It is the company's second-biggest gold mine, and accounted for nearly 30% of gold produced by Endeavour Mining in 2023.\n\n\n== History ==\nEndeavour Mining first purchased the land on the site of the mine in 2012, and published a feasibility study for gold mining the following year.\nIn 2015, the government awarded Endeavour Mining a permit to begin mining, and construction on the mine began the following April.\nCommercial production of gold began in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn May 2022, the Houndé Mine was the site of a series of violent protests. Per a government spokesperson, the protests started on May 17 after the government ordered the expulsion of gold miners it said were there without permits. The spokesperson said this \"was not to the liking of the miners\", who protested by ransacking the mine, injuring seven people and causing significant property damage. The arrest of 12 of the protestors led to another violent episode on May 24, in which two protestors died, one of whom was fatally shot.\nFollowing the September 2022 Burkina Faso coup d'état, Endeavour Mining stated that its work in Burkina Faso was \"unaffected by recent political events\".\nOn January 21, 2024, workers at the Houndé Mine went on strike. On January 30, a Burkinabé court ruled that the strike was illegal, and ordered the expulsion of the striking workers. On February 1, Endeavour Mining said that work at the mine had resumed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "William Thornhill (fl. 1723–1755) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThornhill was a member of one of the younger branches of the great Dorset family of Thornhull of Woolland, a nephew of Sir James Thornhill. He was educated in Bristol under ‘old Rosewell,’ a noted barber-surgeon of the city. He was elected on 20 May 1737 at the surgeons' hall in the market-place to be the first surgeon to the Bristol Infirmary founded in 1735.\nHis attendance at the infirmary was so remiss that he more than once fell under the censure of the ‘house visitors,’ and in 1754 he was called upon to resign his office. He refused to do so, and it was not until June 1755 that he retired. His services were, however, recognised by a unanimous vote of the committee. He left Bristol and practised for a short time at Oxford, but without much success, and he finally retired to Yorkshire, where he died.\nHe married, in 1730, Catherine (d. 1782), daughter of Richard Thompson, a wine merchant of York, and by her had a daughter Anne, who married in 1749 Nathaniel Wraxall of Mayse Hill, near Bristol, and by him became the mother of Sir Nathaniel William Wraxall, who wrote the ‘Historical Memoirs of my Own Time.’\nThornhill claims notice as one of the earliest English surgeons to adopt and improve the operation of suprapubic lithotomy. The records of his work, published by his colleague, John Middleton, M.D., prove that his experience in the operation and his success were greater than any contemporary English surgeon could show. He performed his first suprapubic operation on a boy privately on 3 February 1722–3. In 1727, when his cases were recorded by Middleton, he had performed like operations thirteen times. He did not confine his attention to this part of his profession, for he was also celebrated as a man-midwife. He was a handsome man, of polished manners, and habitually wore an entire suit of black velvet with an elegant steel-handled rapier.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1898). \"Thornhill, William\".

        "content": "The First Higher School (第一高等学校, Daiichi Kōtō Gakkō) was a university preparatory boy's boarding school in Tokyo, Japan. It is the direct predecessor of the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Tokyo.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe First Higher School was founded in 1886 as the nation's first higher school by separating the University of Tokyo's preparatory education division (東京大学予備門), focusing on European languages such as German, French, and English, as the only university in the country, the University of Tokyo, used these languages for teaching at that time.\nModelled after pre-university colleges in the United Kingdom and the United States, its role was to provide future university students with liberal arts education as opposed to specialised university education (教養主義, Kyōyōshugi).\nIn pre-war Japan, students from the upper class often followed a career path described as 'Icchu-Ikko-Teidai (一中一高帝大)', which stands for 'the first middle school (today's Hibiya High School), the First Higher School, then the University of Tokyo'. As symbolised by this phrase, the school was deemed as the most prestigious higher school in the country. Nine prime ministers of Japan were educated at the First Higher School (Kato, Wakatsuki, Hirota, Konoe, Hiranuma, Ashida, Hatoyama, Kishi and Fukuda).\nAfter World War II, American-led educational reforms, targeting 'elitism', abolished higher schools, incorporating them into universities. The First Higher School was closed on 24 March 1950, and it became the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Tokyo. Although for a shorter period of a year and a half compared to three years in the pre-war system, all undergraduates at the university are matriculated at this college and receive liberal arts education. The college still operates on the same campus as the higher school (Komaba Campus, University of Tokyo), and maintains the culture of the school up to today.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "\"Polar Express\" is a proposed Arctic 12,650 km long submarine communication cable connecting Murmansk and Vladivostok by traversing the Northern Sea Route with planned total capacity from 52 to 104 Tbit/s. The cable was proposed on October 26, 2020, by decree of the President of Russia and the project realization was started on November 18, 2020, by Morsvyazsputnik, a subsidiary of Federal Agency for Maritime and River Transportation of Russian Ministry of Transport.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe cable will connect Murmansk and Vladivostok along the shortest route between Europe and Asia, which will create an alternative to satellite communications in northern latitudes. This will help meet the growing needs of online trading, cloud technologies and processing of large volumes of data, providing a reliable and affordable Internet connection.\nIt was planned to begin laying the cable from two opposite ends simultaneously, with the goal of completing the construction by 2026. The planned cost of the project is 65 billion rubles.\nA plant was built in Murmansk for the production of submarine communication cable.\nOn October 27, 2022, the first section of the fiber-optic communication line was completed, the cable was installed in Amderma.\nIn December 2022, Rostelecom built for its own purposes the \"Anadyr – Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky\" fiber-optic line, thus duplicating the \"Polar Express\" network link planned for 2026. Duplicating submarine communication cables may be useful due to the potential accidental damage by ships.\nOn November 1, 2023, the concept of creating a trans-Arctic telecom operator was developed. However, the proposed concept was later asked to be clarified.\nIn 2023, a coastal station was built in Dikson (Krasnoyarsk Krai), work is underway on the section from Amderma to Dikson.\nOther fiber-optic communication projects, such as \"Synergy of Arctic\", are planning to connect to the \"Polar Express\".\nOn November 25, 2023, the  project layout was presented at VDNKh as part of the exhibition \"Russia in Motion\".\nITMO has organized a pilot production line for domestic optical amplifiers (repeaters) for submarine communication cables.\nIn Tiksi, in 2025, a fiber-optic connection will be provided to Arctictelecom from the coastal communication station, the construction of which under the \"Polar Express\" project should begin in 2024.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nThe system uses a specialized submarine cable with 6 pairs of optical fibers and a conductive element to power optical amplifiers. These pairs of optical fibers have different purposes:\n\ntwo pairs are used for the main connection on the route \"Murmansk (Teriberka) – Vladivostok\", with a length of 12,650 km;\ntwo pairs are used to create four independent branches to intermediate objects at various points, such as Amderma, Dikson, Tiksi, Pevek, Anadyr, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk;\ntwo pairs are used to create a backup connection for future development of the entire network.\nTotal capacity planned from 52 to 104 Tbit/s.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1] \"Polar Express\" project description on the website of \"Morsvyazsputnik\"\nполярныйэкспресс.рф — official webpage\nMap \"Communication networks in Russia, 2023\"\nSubmarine Cable Map",

        "content": "John Twysden (1607 – 13 September 1688) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTwysden was the fourth son of Sir William Twysden, first baronet in 1611, was born at Roydon Hall in East Peckham, Kent, in 1607 (Hasted, Kent, ii. 275). Sir Roger Twysden and Sir Thomas Twysden were his brothers. John was educated at University College, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 20 June 1623; he left the university without a degree and entered the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar in 1634. In 1645 he was in Paris (Mathematical Lucubrations), and in 1646 graduated M.D. at Angers. He was incorporated at Oxford 6 Nov. 1651 (Wood, ii. 107), and in 1654 settled in London, and on 22 December was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians, and on 20 October 1664 was elected a fellow. \nHis friend Walter Foster of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, placed in his hands the mathematical remains of Samuel Foster after the death of that Gresham professor in 1652. His first work, published in London in 1654, was an edition of Foster's ‘Four Treatises of Dialing,’ and in 1659 he published the residue of Foster's papers, with some mathematical essays of his own, in a folio volume entitled ‘Miscellanies or Mathematical Lucubrations.’ He published in 1666 ‘Medicina veterum Vindicata, or an Answer to a book entitled Medela Medicinæ,’ a defence of the orthodox medical doctrines of the day against Marchamont Needham. The book, which is dedicated to Lord-chancellor Clarendon, and to the chiefs of the three courts, Keeling, Bridgman, and Hales, shows a good deal of general learning and much power of argument, while many passages illustrate the author's taste for mathematics, but it contains no clinical or pathological observations. In the same year he published another book of the same kind, an ‘Answer to Medicina Instaurata’ (London, 8vo). In 1676 Needham was defeated in an action by the College of Physicians before Twysden's brother, Sir Thomas Twysden, in the court of king's bench (Goodall, Col. of Physicians, p. 273). He continued his mathematical studies, and published in 1685 ‘The Use of the Great Planisphere called the Analemma.’ He died unmarried on 13 September 1688. He was buried on the 15th in St. Margaret's Church, Westminster. His account of the last illness and death of his mother and two letters are extant in Brit. Mus. Addit. MSS. 34173 and 34176.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Moore, Norman (1899). \"Twysden, John\". In Lee, Sidney (ed.).

        "content": "Oldersum is a village in the region of East Frisia, in Lower Saxony, Germany. Administratively, it is an Ortsteil of the municipality of Moormerland. Located on the north bank of the Ems estuary, Oldersum is to the southeast of Emden and the northwest of Leer. It has a population of 1,533.\n\n\n== History ==\nOldersum and the surrounding area formed its own lordship that was controlled by the chief family who named themselves von Oldersum, after the village. Within the lordship, the village had the status of a Flecken. The lordship was sold in 1631 to the city of Emden, which then took control.\nIn June 1526, the so-called Colloquy of Oldersum (Oldersumer Religionsgespräch) took place in the church of Oldersum, between a Roman Catholic and a Lutheran theologian. The report drawn up was printed and distributed in large numbers and contributed significantly to the Reformation in Northern Germany and the Dutch province of Groningen.\nThe old church of Oldersum was destroyed by fire in 1916 and later replaced by a new building.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nUko Fockena (c. 1408–1432), East Frisian chieftain\nTheda Ukena (1432–1494), Countess and regent of East Frisia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Oldersum at Wikimedia Commons",

It was listed as part of the Early Stone Houses of Bergen County Multiple Property Submission (MPS).\nThe house was built in 1736 by tradition, but around 1750 to 1760 based on architectural evidence. It has been expanded by a two and one-half story Victorian wing.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Closter, New Jersey\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Bergen County, New Jersey\nIsaac Naugle House\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Viktor Zhitomirsky (1894–1954)  was a Soviet physician, infectious disease scientist and epidemiologist who pioneered the study of microbiology in Tajikistan.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nViktor Zhitomirsky was born in a Jewish family in Taganrog close to the modern-day Russia–Ukraine border. His father, Konstantin Israel Zhitomirsky, was a Yiddish scholar and pedagogue. His mother, Zinaida Vikteshmayer, was a daughter of a local merchant who owned a coal warehouse.\nHe graduated from the Kharkiv University in 1919 and took part in the Russian Civil War as a military doctor. Later, he lived in Rostov-on-Don and Moscow where he worked at a research institute which developed vaccines. In 1938, he organized a field trip to Tajikistan where he researched the potential threat of a cholera epidemic which was spreading in neighboring Afghanistan. In 1939, he was offered a job as lecturer at a medical institute in Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East and became a professor.\nIn the beginning of World War Two, he moved to Dushanbe, then called Stalinabad, which was the capital of the Tajik SSR. In June 1941, he became the first head of the newly established Microbiology Department at the Stalinabad Medical Institute which was later renamed to Avicenna Tajik State Medical University.\nAccording to the Tajik journalist and historian Gafur Shermatov, Zhitomirsky was one of the doctors whose work had helped stop the rapid spread of epidemics in Dushanbe of the 1940s, when the city became a destination for over a hundred thousands evacuees from the European part of the USSR.\nAlong with his work at the Stalinabad Medical Institute as a lecturer, he was a leading researcher at the local Institute for Tropical Diseases. In this capacity, he co-authored a book on viral hemorrhagic fevers with Samuil Shapiro.\nHe was fired from both institutions in 1953 under the Soviet anti-cosmopolitan campaign which has been widely described as a thinly disguised antisemitic purge. The formal reason for his dismissal was that one of his research papers on malaria in Central Asia was allegedly offensive to the Tajik people, as he mentioned that their traditional houses made of clay provided a good environment for the disease-carrying marsh mosquitoes.\n\n\n== Writing ==\nViktor Zhitomirsky was also an amateur writer. His book The Pamir Diary (1943) is a recollection of his field trip to Vanj District in Tajikistan's Pamir Mountains where he helped fight a typhus epidemic.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2023, the National Council on Television and Radio Broadcasting twice appointed an unscheduled inspection of the channel due to the use of profanity on the air. On 21 December 2023, the regulator fined the TV channel as a result of the inspection.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn 11 July 2019, the ISLND TV channel was licensed by the National Council of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting. According to the website of the National Council, the channel's founder and main owner is a pro-Russian propagandist and black campaign manager Volodymyr Petrov (he owns 94% of the authorised capital, with another 3% each held by the channel's co-founders, blogger Oleksandr Baraboshko and channel director Pavlo Nemeryuk). On 1 June 2020, the channel began broadcasting via satellite from Azerspace-1, but after the entry into force of the Law on Media in July 2023, ISLND TV changed the technology to Internet broadcasting (OTT).\nOn 26 October 2023, the National Council of Television and Radio Broadcasting appointed an unscheduled inspection of the ISLND TV channel. The National Council received a complaint from journalist Dmytro Gordon about the channel's broadcast. The regulator monitored and recorded the presence of foul language in the programmes Rozryv and Super Live with the participation of Volodymyr Petrov. According to Maksym Onopriyenko, a member of the National Council, according to the Law \"On Media\", the dissemination of obscene words can harm the mental and moral development of children. At the same time, there were no signs or warnings about this in the aforementioned programmes of the ISLND TV channel. Following the inspection, on 21 December, the regulator fined the channel UAH 268,000.\nThe channel participated in a tender for broadcasting on the state-owned MX-7 multiplex of the DVB-T2 digital terrestrial network. Based on the results of the tender, announced by the regulator on 31 October 2023, the National Council denied ISLND TV a digital broadcasting licence. Representatives of the regulator, in particular, noted during the discussion that Volodymyr Petrov and other hosts of the channel told outright lies about the regulator in their broadcasts. According to the members of the National Council, the regulator has repeatedly received complaints about obscene language and mat on the channel's airwaves.\nOn 11 December 2023, the National Council of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting appointed another unscheduled inspection of ISLND TV due to the use of profanity in the Super Live programme.\n\n\n== Scandals ==\nIn one of the broadcasts on ISLND TV, Petrov's guest was Dmytro Vasylets, a politician and head of the pro-Russian political party Derzhava, which is banned in Ukraine, who, after the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, repeated the Kremlin's propaganda lies that \"Ukraine deserved to be destroyed\" because it had been \"destroying Donbas for eight years\". In 2015, Vasilets was arrested on suspicion of aiding Russian mercenaries and assisting the separatist TV channel Novorossiya TV, but was released in 2018. In 2020, Petrov praised Vasylets for spending more than two years in jail for his pro-Russian views, which, according to Volodymyr Petrov, means that Vasylets has a \"systematic approach\".\nIn 2021, in one of the broadcasts on the ISLND TV channel, Volodymyr Petrov organised a provocation on the topic of the Ukrainian language. He posted a video in which he criticised the Ukrainian language and said that it sounded like a crawling cart. He said that Russian language was easier, while Ukrainian had letters that were difficult to pronounce.\nAfter the beginning of Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, on the ISLND TV channel, in one of the broadcasts, the host Volodymyr Petrov insulted the military. He recorded a video message to a Ukrainian serviceman, Senior Sergeant of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleh Barna, calling him worse than the Russian occupiers. On 17 April 2023, Oleh Barna was killed in action at the front near Vuhledar.\nDuring 2023–2024, threats and insults against journalists were disseminated on the ISLND TV channel. On 23 October 2023, in one of the broadcasts on ISLND TV, Volodymyr Petrov threatened to \"punish\" Natalia Lygachova, the editor-in-chief of Detector Media for her words about his work for the Presidential Office. Roman Golovenko, a lawyer with the Institute of Mass Information (IMI), notes that at the end of the video, Sergii Ivanov asked Volodymyr Petrov to stop speaking and not to threaten, and stressed that even his colleague on the air interpreted these words as threats. Danylo Popkov, a lawyer with the Zmina Human Rights Centre, explained that Petrov's words about Natalia Lygachova fall under Article 345-1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine — threatening or violence against a journalist. He stressed that Lygachova's words about Petrov's activities, which led to his threats, were spoken in public and can be interpreted as journalistic activity, and therefore the article covers this case.\nOn 27 October 2023, on ISLND TV, Petrov called Natalia Lygachova, editor-in-chief of Detector Media, and Yulia Mostova and Vitaliy Sych, editors-in-chief of Dzerkalo Tyzhnia and The New Voice of Ukraine, \"escorts\". On 7 November, Petrov called Ukrainska Pravda journalists \"wafflers\".\nOn the air of the programme Chornyi Rozryv on the ISLND TV channel, Volodymyr Petrov, discussing journalist Dmytro Gordon with co-host Sergii Ivanov, repeatedly insulted his mother, Mina Davydivna Gordon, who passed away in 2018.\nIn 2023–2024, ISLND TV channel was accused of spreading misogynistic narratives, and the channel's hosts were accused of being sexist during their broadcasts. In particular, the hosts Volodymyr Petrov and Sergii Ivanov repeatedly spoke negatively about Masha Efrosinina and the singer Alyona Alyona and humiliated them. Alyona Alyona responded to Petrov and Ivanov's statements on Instagram. She reminded that this was not the first public insult they had made against her. Masha Efrosinina also reacted to the Alyona Alyona scandal, saying that she was \"perhaps the very first woman they started upholstering their misogynistic narratives\". He adds that she \"never drew attention to it\". \"For me, they are just like a street garbage can that I pass by every morning without turning my head,\" Efrosinina said.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe editor-in-chief of the Detector Media portal, Natalia Lygachova, was outraged that the National Council on Television and Radio Broadcasting had granted a licence to the ISLND TV channel. \"The fact that the National Council granted ISLND TV a licence is nonsense. These are black political technologists working for the Presidential Office, who have no place in telethons, YouTube, or anywhere else,\" Lygachova said.\n\n\n== References ==",

Proceeding to Trinity College, Cambridge, he graduated B.A. with distinguished reputation in 1731 (Graduati Cantabr. 1823, p. 463). He at first intended to take holy orders, but afterwards he applied himself to the study of medicine, and went in 1736 to the university of Leyden, where he attended the lectures of Dr. Herman Boerhaave, and was created M.D. on 10 Sept. 1737 (Album Studiosorum Acad. Lugd. Bat. 1875, p. 967). In 1739 he came to London with a view to enter on the practice of his profession, supported by a handsome allowance from his father. He was so fond, however, of literary leisure and of the society of learned men that he never acquired a very extensive practice.\nIn 1750 he was introduced to Dr. John Fothergill with a view to institute a medical society in order to procure the earliest intelligence of improvements in physic from every part of Europe, but the plan never took effect. When the British Museum was opened in 1758, for purposes of inspection and study, Templeman was appointed on 22 December to the office of keeper of the reading-room. Gray gives an amusing account of a visit to the reading-room while under his care (Works, 1884, iii. 1–2). Templeman resigned the post on 18 December 1760 on being chosen secretary to the recently instituted Society of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. In 1762 he was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, and also of the Economical Society at Berne. He died on 23 August 1769 (Cambridge Chronicle, 30 Aug. 1769). Bowyer says ‘he was esteemed a person of great learning, particularly with respect to languages, spoke French with great fluency, and left the character of a humane, generous, and polite member of society.’ A portrait by Richard Cosway belongs to the Society of Arts, and was engraved by William Evans.\nHis works are:\n\n‘On a Polypus at the Heart, and a Scirrhous Tumour of the Uterus’ (in the ‘Philosophical Transactions,’ 1746).\n‘Curious Remarks and Observations in Physics, Anatomy, Chirurgery, Chemistry, Botany, and Medicine; selected from the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris,’ 2 vols.

        "content": "Nodosculda is an extinct genus of mantis shrimp that lived in North America during the late Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous period, between 105 and 100 million years ago. The only species is Nodosculda fisherorum, known from several specimens uncovered in the Paw Paw Formation of Texas.\n\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\nDuring the late 20th century, several fossil specimens of mantis shrimp were excavated from outcrops of the Paw Paw Formation in the area around Fort Worth, Texas by amateur paleontologists. These fossils were then collected by paleontologist Robert Reid and housed in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.. Over 20 years after their initial discovery, the fossils were studied by paleontologist Ovidiu D. Franţescu, who recognized that they represent a new genus and species which he named Nodosculda fisherorum in 2012. The generic name combines the Latin word \"nodus\" (meaning knob or swelling) with Sculda (another fossil mantis shrimp), referencing the many knobs and bumps on the animal's carapace and its similarity to Sculda. The specific name honors the Fisher family of Sherman, New York for their support. The specimen USNM 545561 was chosen as the holotype of the species, while several other specimens were designated as paratypes. \n\n\n== Description ==\nWith a flattened body, Nodosculda is largely similar in appearance to Sculda, which it is named after. The carapace of Nodosculda is trapezoidal in shape, wider at the back than at the front, and has many knobs and bumps across its surface, giving it an uneven texture. The side margins of the carapace are gently curved and each has a keel running alongside it, while the back margin is concave. A pair of lateral keels run down the length of the carapace, while a pair of transverse keels are present on the front corners of the carapace. At the back of the carapace, there is a short, wide arrow-shaped ridge pointing forwards, with a large knob directly behind its middle.\nLike all mantis shrimp, Nodosculda has raptorial appendages attached to its thorax. The propodus (penultimate segment) is ovate in shape and very broad, measuring three times as long as the dactylus (final segment). There is also a groove running down the propodus. The dactylus is short and thin, with no grooves or ornamentation. This is unlike the raptorial appendages of any living mantis shrimp, but does resemble those of Sculda. Similarly, the pleopods (appendages of the abdomen used for swimming) have an ovate shape, wider at the base than at the end. The pleopods are biramous (branched into two lobes), the exopods (outer lobe) of which are composed of six articulated segments, the lower half of which are lined with spines on the margins (15 long spines and at least six much shorter spines). The endopods (inner lobe) are around the size of the exopods and partly exposed, made up of a single segment lined with setae (bristles).\nThe first four segments of the thorax are covered by the carapace. The fifth thoracic segment (the first to be exposed) is short and only weakly ornamented, unlike the sixth to eighth segments. The sixth thoracic segment has over 10 smooth ridges running down its length, the seventh has over 17 spines arranged in two rows, and the eighth has a distinct row of at least 32 ridges which terminate as spines. Each of the six segments of the abdomen has two rows of small spines, with the number of spines on each segment decreasing along the animal's length (the first abdominal segment has 24 spines while the sixth has only 12). Lateral and marginal keels on each abdominal segment form continuous ridges running down the length of the abdomen. Two sharp, backward-pointed spines are located at each side margin of each abdominal sclerite (hardened part).\nPart of the telson is preserved, showing spines of various sizes pointing backwards and arranged in rows, as well as distinct keels running down its length. The uropods are biramous, with the endopod having a thin keel on the outer margin and a coarse dentition-like inner margin, while the exopod has a groove along its outer margin.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nDue to its flattened shape giving it an overall similarity to Sculda, Nodosculda was placed in the family Sculdidae by Franţescu (2012), making it the third known genus in the family (after Sculda and Spinosculda). This family was established by Dames (1886) and belongs to the suborder Unipeltata, which includes all living species of mantis shrimp and extinct forms that lived during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras.\nThe monophyly of Sculdidae was questioned by Smith et al. (2023), who conducted a phylogenetic analysis to determine the relations between fossil mantis shrimp. Their analysis recovered Nodosculda to be a closer relative of the extant Squilla mantis than of Sculda, at a sister taxon position with the modern species. However, the authors note that the incomplete knowledge of Nodosculda, Ursquilla and Lysiosquilla nkporoensis may be responsible for such a result, and that more material is needed to resolve their relationships. The results of their analysis are displayed in the cladogram below:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

The album was nominated for a W. C. Handy Award for best \"Acoustic Blues Album\".\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe album was produced by John Platania. Davis did not spend a lot of time on song selection, choosing what he liked, what others liked, and what was already worked out. He played banjo, six- and twelve-string guitars, and washboard; he played a didgeridoo on \"Layla, Layla\". Ken Whiteley contributed on mandolin. \"Loneliest Road That I Know\" is a version of Mississippi Fred McDowell's song \"Highway 61\". \"What You Doin'\" is a cover of the Sleepy John Estes song. \"Good Liquor\" is a cover the Big Bill Broonzy song. \"Joppatowne\" is about a prisoner returning to his hometown for a funeral. \"I Will Be Your Friend\" is a tribute to the Scottish musician Davy Steele, who died in 2001.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nRobert Christgau called the album \"country blues in the spirit of friendship, like John Hurt did it.\" The Star Tribune wrote that \"Davis continues his dogged but creative commitment to traditional acoustic blues.\" The Gazette determined that \"Davis recalls the days when jug bands ruled Memphis's Beale St.,\" writing that his original songs \"preserve and carry forward the tradition.\" The Birmingham Post opined that Davis \"has an inbuilt empathy with the music, without any of the vaudeville hokum of Keb' Mo' or the sophisticated gloss of Eric Bibb.\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution concluded that \"his previous albums have sometimes been weighed down by an artificial vocal gruffness...

        "content": "The Russian Rurik Expedition (\"Rurick Expedition\") was a circumnavigation of the world that took place from July 30, 1815 to August 3, 1818 under the command of Otto von Kotzebue and was intended to discover and explore the Northwest Passage. The expedition of the warship Rurik (Russian Рюрик) was equipped and financed by the Russian Count Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantsev (Russian Никола́й Румянцев). It took place with the benevolent support of Tsar Alexander I. Due to adverse weather conditions, however, it did not reach its destination and returned earlier than planned. The historical significance of the expedition lies in the number of new discoveries along the entire route as well as the human and cultural experiences that the crew brought back from this three-year journey.\n\n\n== Aim of the expedition ==\nThe Russian desire to find the Northwest Passage was primarily for economic reasons. It was difficult and expensive to maintain supplies to the trading bases on the east coast of Russia and in the colony of Russian America, which stretched along the American west coast from Alaska to San Francisco, by land across the Asian continent. The search for a sea route to the north of the European and Asian continents (Northeast Passage) had not yet brought the desired success. The sea routes around the southern tip of Africa (Cape of Good Hope) or America (Cape Horn), on the other hand, proved to be time-consuming and dangerous due to a variety of threats, including adverse weather and piracy. Russia therefore hoped to discover a passage to the north of the American continent, which would have been much shorter and probably easier to navigate.\nAs all attempts to discover this sea route from the east had so far failed, this time the passage was to be found from the west and explored and sailed through in the opposite direction. It was hoped that the expedition's starting position could be improved by the fact that Russia had numerous trading bases on the west coast of the North American continent, which could serve as starting points for supplying the crew and providing other logistical support for the campaign.\nThe voyage included two summer campaigns (1816 and 1817): The first was intended to explore suitable anchorages north of the Bering Strait. With the second, they hoped to advance further north and east from there the following summer.\nLike many before and after it, the expedition did not achieve its goal. However, Otto von Kotzebue was able to demonstrate a continuous ocean current, which was the first scientific proof of the existence of the Northwest Passage. In addition, von Kotzebue mapped over 400 islands in Polynesia and large parts of the west coast of Alaska. The naturalists documented a large number of unknown animal and plant species.\n\n\n== Members of the expedition ==\nIn addition to the three coxswains Khramchenko, Petrov and Koniev, two non-commissioned officers, a cook and 20 sailors, the following people took part in the expedition:\n\nOtto von Kotzebue (1787–1846), lieutenant in the Imperial Russian Navy, captain of the Rurik and leader of the expedition.\nJohann Friedrich Eschscholtz (1793–1831), ship's doctor and naturalist\nAdelbert von Chamisso (1781–1838), naturalist (titular scholar), author of the diary Reise um die Welt in den Jahren 1815-1818\nLouis Choris (1795–1828), draughtsman (was also available to the naturalists for documentation purposes)\nMorten Wormskjold (1783–1845), volunteer naturalist (disembarked in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky)\nGleb Semyonovich Shishmaryov, first lieutenant\nIvan Yakovlevich Sakharin, second lieutenant\nVasily Stepanovich Khromchenko, assistant coxswain\nThe following people were on board temporarily during the voyage:\n\nAugust 17, 1815: A pilot for the voyage in the Channel and to Plymouth.\nOctober 1, 1816: Two Russian sailors and one passenger: Elliot de Castro, personal physician to the King of Hawaii (from San Francisco to Hawaii)\nFebruary 23, 1817: The South Sea islander Kadu (during the entire summer campaign of 1817)\nMay 27, 1817: Two interpreters for the dialects of the more northern coastal peoples.\nAugust 1817: Four Aleuts to strengthen the crew\n\n\n== The ship ==\nThe Rurik, named after the Varangian prince and founder of Russia Rurik (ca. 830 to ca. 879), was a small brig of 180 tons. For the duration of the expedition, it was authorized to fly the imperial Russian battle flag. It was therefore considered a warship. As the primary goal of the voyage was the discovery of the Northwest Passage, the ship was equipped only secondarily as a research vessel. The accompanying explorers therefore had to follow the military customs on board. Kotzebue's words to Adelbert von Chamisso, \"that [he] as a passenger on a warship, where one was not accustomed to having any demands, had no right to make any.\" The explorers had little space available for collecting plants and artifacts. Most of the collections were immediately stowed away in sealed boxes below deck. As Adelbert von Chamisso describes, collections that were openly displayed were often thrown overboard (even on the captain's orders), as they interfered with the sailors' daily tasks on board.\nThe ship was only lightly armed and the eight cannons were used almost exclusively for firing salutes when entering and leaving foreign ports. Towards the end of the voyage, the Rurik encountered alleged pirate ships near the Sunda Strait, which were kept at a distance by firing warning shots.\nBefore the second summer campaign in 1817, the Rurik ran into a storm off Kamchatka and was badly damaged. The hastily carried out repair work in Unalaska was more of a damage limitation exercise than a complete restoration. The condition of the Rurik was officially regarded as one of the reasons why von Kotzebue did not want to continue north and abandoned the expedition's goal. During the return journey, the Rurik underwent a general overhaul at the shipyard in Cavite in the Philippines.\n\n\n== Course of the expedition ==\n\n\n=== From St. Petersburg to Kamchatka ===\nThe Rurik was to reach the Pacific via Cape Horn. This first major leg of the voyage, starting from St. Petersburg and Kronstadt, was already characterized by several shore excursions, from which the expedition's naturalists in particular were able to benefit. After a first short stay in Copenhagen, the journey continued to Plymouth on the south coast of England to prepare for the long Atlantic crossing. A stay of several days on Tenerife in the Canary Islands allowed the naturalists to explore a new world for the first time. Finally, on December 12, 1815, the Rurik reached the island of Ilha de Santa Catarina off the coast of Brazil and moored at Florianópolis.\n\nThe rest of the voyage to the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka - around Cape Horn - was mainly characterized by a long stay in Talcahuano, Chile, during which lavish celebrations were held with the governor, the commander and the noblemen of the town and surrounding area. The subsequent voyage across the Pacific was carried out in haste in order to arrive in the Avacha Bay early enough to prepare for the summer campaign of 1816. The aim was to use the few warm days of the year to advance far enough north before the winter ice set in again.\nOtto von Kotzebue chose a route far from the usual trade routes on his way to Awatscha. He mapped many islands in the Polynesian archipelago that had not yet been explored. However, the names given to these islands at the time have changed frequently to this day due to subsequent colonization by several other nations. On June 19, 1816, the Rurik docked in the Avacha Bay off Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.\n\n\n=== Summer campaign 1816 ===\n\nThe summer campaign of 1816 began on July 14 with the departure from Avacha Bay on the Kamchatka Peninsula and ended with the arrival in the harbor of Unalaska, an island in the Aleutian Islands, on September 7. Its purpose was to explore the sea and the coasts north of the Bering Strait and to find suitable anchorages in preparation for a further advance during the summer campaign of 1817. During this voyage, Kotzebue Sound with Eschscholtz Bay and Chamisso Island and other landmarks were discovered (see map on the right). Contact was also established and maintained with the locals living there. After an initial cautious approach, it was often possible to trade: In exchange for needles, scissors, knives and, above all, tobacco, the expedition members were able to obtain provisions, clothing and cultural items in the form of everyday objects, works of art or cult objects.\nThe Rurik sailed on from Avacha Bay on a north-easterly course until it reached St. Lawrence Island and then crossed the Bering Strait along the Alaskan coast. Here the captain first followed a sandbank-like chain of islands lying just off the coast until Shishmarev Bay was reached. After a brief exploration of the bay, the journey continued to Cape Espenberg at the northern entrance to Kotzebue Sound. Hoping to have found the entrance to the Northwest Passage there, the course was changed to the east on August 2. However, the Rurik soon encountered the Baldwin Peninsula and followed the coastline southwards until the entrance to Eschscholtz Bay opened up, into which the ship sailed between the Baldwin Peninsula and Chamisso Island. In the days that followed, the captain had the bay explored with rowing boats, but had to realize that there was no way forward. On August 7, Eschscholtz discovered icebergs in the south of the bay.\nOn August 11, the expedition resumed its journey and followed the southern coast of Kotzebue Sound to the mouth of the Kiwalik River. There, von Kotzebue asked an Eskimo about the further course of the river. He suspected a direct connection to southern Norton Sound across the Seward Peninsula. As this assumption could not be confirmed, the expedition was resumed in a northerly direction until it reached Cape Krusenstern in the north of the entrance to the sound. Because summer had now advanced, the captain decided to cross the Chukchi Sea in a westerly direction and pass the Bering Strait southwards along the Russian coast.\n\nThe Rurik sailed south of the strait into the St. Lawrence Bay (Russian: zaliv Lavrentija) and anchored there. The captain traded fresh reindeer meat with the Chukchi people living there. During the stay, many Chukchi from southern Mechigmensky Bay (Russian: Mečigmeskij zaliv) came to St. Lawrence Bay to marvel at the new arrivals. Due to bad weather, the captain did not set course for the eastern tip of St. Lawrence Island until August 29. Due to persistent dense fog, the Rurik ran at a respectful distance along the island to the east, did not dare to anchor and finally set course to the south. On September 3, the island of Saint Paul in the Pribilof Islands came into view. The Rurik sailed on here as well and entered the port of Unalaska on September 7.\nIn Unalaska, the agent of the \"Russian-American Company\" (a Russian trading company) was tasked with preparing the following year's summer campaign, while the Rurik was to spend the winter in more southerly latitudes. In addition, 16 Aleuts (including a translator) had to be ready to travel north the following year.\n\n\n=== From Unalaska across the East Pacific ===\n\nTo avoid the harsh winter in the north and give the crew some rest before the planned summer campaign in 1817, the Rurik headed south to warmer regions. This voyage took them from Unalaska to San Francisco in Spanish California and on to Hawaii and the Marshall Islands.\nIn San Francisco and Hawaii, the crew had to take on diplomatic tasks that went far beyond the scope of their scientific mission. First of all, a dispute between the Spanish governor of the region, Don Paolo Vicente de Sola, and the Russian Empire - represented by Otto von Kotzebue in his capacity as a lieutenant in the Imperial Russian Navy - concerning the actions of the Russian-American Trading Company on the Californian coast was provisionally settled in negotiations in the Presidio of San Francisco: Disagreements had arisen under international law with Russian colonists who had established a fur trade settlement and fort a little further north on Bodega Bay without permission from the Spanish. Von Kotzebue succeeded in postponing a possible armed conflict by persuading both parties to make their further actions dependent on the attitude of their respective governments. However, there was no official reaction from the governments concerned and so the status quo remained for some time.\nHawaii had also recently been the victim of a political dispute with forces of the Russian-American Trading Company. Two of their merchant ships had hoisted the Russian flag on one of the islands in an attempt to take possession of it for the Tsar. Bloodshed was avoided in time thanks to the mediation of some Europeans and Americans living there, but in response to their expulsion, the Russian sailors threatened to wage war on the islands. In this situation, the Rurik reached Hawaii and found itself confronted by a large number of armed and combat-ready islanders. Fortunately, the Rurik had taken on board Elliot de Castro, the personal physician of the King of Hawaii, in San Francisco. He was able to mediate before war broke out. As a guest of King Kamehameha I, Otto von Kotzebue was subsequently able to convince him of his and the Russian Empire's peaceful attitude.\nThe expedition then visited numerous island kingdoms in the island world of the Marshall Islands. The Ratak chain was mainly mapped and attempts were made to introduce the locals, who had to live off the rather meagre resources of the islands, to new sources of food by growing fruit and vegetables. However, these attempts almost completely failed, as rats devastated many of the allotments and the islanders had difficulty accepting farm animals. Nevertheless, relations between the representatives of the two cultures were as open as they were friendly and allowed for lively bartering and the giving of gifts. On departure, a Rataker named Kadu joined the expedition and both naturalist and captain took the opportunity to learn more about the language, culture and geography of this island community.\n\nOn the journey back north, the Rurik was caught in a heavy storm that severely damaged the ship. The expedition made it to the safe harbor of Unalaska with great difficulty. Three sailors had been seriously injured in the storm and the captain's health had also suffered. There was not much time to get the ship ready for sea again, as summer was already setting in and so the Rurik was only provisionally repaired and quickly equipped for the second summer campaign.\n\n\n=== Summer campaign of 1817 ===\n\nThe expectations placed on the expedition could not be fulfilled. Starting from the coasts and anchorages explored in the summer of 1816, the expedition was to find the Northwest Passage. Fifteen Aleuts were taken on board for this purpose, as well as a number of small boats. If it proved impossible to continue the journey on the Rurik, the plan was to leave it at a safe anchorage and continue the journey on the small boats with the help of the Aleuts. However, after the crew had stocked up on food and equipment on Unalaska and the Pribilof Islands, the prospects were bad: the winter had lasted a long time this year, the ice melt was late and the captain's health was also beginning to deteriorate due to the low temperatures and wet weather.\nWhen the eastern tip of St. Lawrence Island was reached on July 10, the captain learned from the Chukchi that the ice in the north had only been broken up for a few days and was slowly drifting north with the current. That same day, the captain raised the anchors and sailed around the island. However, ice was sighted in the evening. The captain was suffering from severe chest pains and was bedridden. The ship's doctor assured the captain that he would be risking his life if he continued north. The condition of the ship was also not ideal for defying the harsh conditions of the north.\nUnder these circumstances, the captain decided on July 12 to abandon the expedition's destination and sail home via Unalaska, Hawaii, the Marshall Islands and Manila. This decision was later heavily criticized. It was unusual at the time, especially on a warship, to make the course of a voyage dependent on the health of the captain when there were other officers (such as Lieutenant Shishmarev) on board who could have taken command. It was also speculated that the northward drifting pack ice would have opened up after the Rurik had evaded Kamchatka or St. Lawrence Bay. However, the captain's written order stood firm and the return journey to Unalaska was begun.\nThe Rurik turned back and crossed the Bering Sea heading for Unalaska without seeing St. Matthew Island and the Pribilof Islands due to foggy weather. On July 22, the Rurik entered the port of Unalaska again.\n\n\n=== Return journey across Manila ===\nDuring a short stay on Unalaska, the expedition equipment for the north and most of the additional Alëuten were disembarked. The Rurik then sailed to Hawaii, where the explorers met the king again. From there, the journey continued to the Marshall Islands. However, the reception there was not exuberant, as most of the men had gone to war against a neighboring island kingdom. The Rataker Kadu also disembarked here. In view of the unstable situation, the Rurik remained only briefly off these islands. In a hurry, an attempt was made to plant some gardens and accommodate livestock. Kadu was to oversee the maintenance of these new food sources.\nThe Rurik then sailed to Manila, where the ship, which had suffered damage during the northern voyages, was repaired in the shipyard at Cavite. After a long stay, the ship continued through the Sunda Strait into the Indian Ocean, which was crossed to the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. There, the Rurik anchored for a short time in Cape Town. The expedition then continued its journey along the islands of the South Atlantic and returned to Portsmouth in England via the Canary Islands. The last leg of the journey was a direct route to Kronstadt Fortress and on to St. Petersburg.\n\n\n== Research work ==\n\nAdelbert von Chamisso had to realize regretfully at the beginning of the voyage that his role as titular scholar on the Rurik was only of secondary importance. However, it was only at the beginning of the summer campaign in 1816 that he began to suspect the reasons for this, when he learned that the main, indeed almost exclusive, aim of the expedition was to explore the Northwest Passage and that all his research was merely a decorative accessory to satisfy the spirit of the times, which demanded that such expeditions be accompanied by scholars. Ultimately, however, it was a matter of \"high politics\", namely that Russia was already aware at the time that it would only be able to keep the colonies on the American mainland in the long term if it could open up a viable sea route in the North Sea to supply them and enter into stable trade relations with them. As the tsar considered the likelihood of success to be low, it was left to Count Rumyantsev to finance the campaign.\nHowever, this did not diminish Chamisso's curiosity. From the very beginning, he collected everything that he thought might be of importance for any branch of science at the time: plants, animals, minerals, bones and handicraft products of the peoples he visited. His passion for collecting did not even restrain him from human skulls. Wherever he could, he tried to catalog and describe what he found, and studied the languages, customs and traditions of the people he encountered. He had a great love for the peoples of Polynesia and Micronesia. More than once he had to experience that parts of his collection were destroyed or mutilated by the sailors of his own ship, sometimes willfully, sometimes out of ignorance. But he continued undaunted, and in the end he managed to bring home a considerable collection of evidence of a world that was still foreign to Europe at the time.\nAs the sponsor of the journey, Count Rumyantsev, did not insist on any title to the artifacts he had brought with him, von Chamisso was able to ship them to Berlin at the end of the journey. He donated most of the natural and cultural artefacts he had collected to the Botanical Garden in Berlin, where he found a position as second curator. In addition to a volume of the official expedition report, he published his travel diary Reise um die Welt in den Jahren 1815-1818 in 1836 and his language study Über die Hawaiische Sprache in 1837.\n\n\n== After the expedition ==\nThe Rurik was sold after arriving in St. Petersburg. Otto von Kotzebue wrote a detailed expedition report, which was supplemented by the reports of the individual expedition members.\nAfter his appointment as captain, von Kotzebue undertook another voyage around the world on the Predprijatije from 1823 to 1826, on which he was accompanied by Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz. They also visited the island chains that they had discovered with the Rurik. They discovered that the attempts to spread new food and livestock on the islands had largely failed.\nThe Northwest Passage lost importance for Russia. After the various search expeditions for the missing British explorer John Franklin around the middle of the 19th century had proven the insignificance of the Northwest Passage for shipping, the fur trade on the American west coast began to decline at the same time. As a result of the abandonment of the settlements in North America, Alaska was finally sold in 1867. The Northeast Passage, which was opened up by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1879, and the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway (1891–1916) served to supply the Russian settlements on the Pacific directly.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nvon Chamisso, Adelbert (1836).

        "content": "Momome is a female cleansing ritual among some Akan groups in the present day Ghana and Ivory Coast. The ritual is aimed at cleansing the community from impending crisis. The momome ritual in the precolonial setting was held in response to wars but within the twentieth century it was increasingly evoke in moments of crisis (illness, deposition, death) of prominent figures of the chiefly establishment.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe momome ritual existed long before the seventeenth century where practices about it was first witnessed. It had similar names and same significance among the many Akan tribes who practice. The Asantes calls it mmumue, mmusu(o)yiedee, momome or mmobomme. The ritual is known as momome amongst the Aowin, mume, mumune or momone amongst the Anyi and aworabe amongst the Akwapim. \nThe Akan people in those era considered crisis which befell their communities as attacks from evil spirits. They believe those omen had both spiritual and tangible aspects. The performance consists of a mimic fight demonstrating the terrestrial visible expression of a spiritual clash between malignant forces and the supernatural allies defending the community The ritual was a distinctly a female form of spiritual warfare.  The ritual though was mainly meant for spiritual cleansing, it gained strong political significance in the peoples fight for independence.\n\n\n== Reasons ==\nThe momome ritual has several significance, it was performed on many occasions with different purposes.  The ritual is held to avert  real or potential environmental disasters. It was on record that a momome was held to avert the flood of river Tano in 1968. It is performance  also to stop the spread of diseases. Among the Akans in Sefwi momome were often held to protect the community from epidemics. The momome rituals performed within the twentieth century was of more political reason. Momome were held to react to national political threats such as the fall of Busia in 197210 or the expulsion of over a million Ghanaians from Nigeria in 1983.    \n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Thomas Jolliffe Tufnell (23 May 1819 –  27 November 1885) was an English surgeon.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTufnell was the fifth son of John Charles Tufnell, lieutenant-colonel of the Middlesex militia, by his wife Uliana Ivaniona, only daughter of John Fowell, rector of Bishopsbourne, Kent. He was born at Lackham House, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, on 23 May 1819. He was educated at Dr. Radcliffe's school at Salisbury, and was apprenticed in 1836 to Samuel Luscombe of Exeter, then senior surgeon to the Devon and Exeter Hospital. Tufnell proceeded to London after studying at Exeter for three years, and entered at St. George's Hospital under Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie and Cæsar Hawkins. He was admitted a member of the College of Surgeons of England in May 1841, and on 11 June in the same year he entered the army as assistant surgeon to the 44th regiment, then serving in India. He proceeded to Calcutta, and took medical charge of all the troops as they arrived from England, remaining for this purpose at Chinsurah until the last detachment had landed at Christmas. By this delay he was hindered from participating in the disastrous campaign in Afghanistan in 1842, in which the 44th regiment was almost annihilated. He returned to England in October, and was posted to the 3rd dragoon guards, with whom he served at Dundalk, Dublin, and Cork. In 1844 he was married, and determined to leave the service and settle in private practice. On 14 April 1846 he accordingly obtained his transfer to the army medical staff at Dublin, and shortly afterwards accepted as a life appointment the post of surgeon to the Dublin district military prison. He was admitted in 1845 the first fellow by examination of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, and in 1846 he fitted up a class-room and lectured on military hygiene. He also lectured upon this subject at the St. Vincent and Bagot Street hospitals until his appointment as regius professor of military surgery in the College of Surgeons in 1851. He lectured in this capacity until 1860, when the chair was abolished by the government as a result of the foundation of the Netley military school. Tufnell again saw service; for in the war between Russia and Turkey, after passing down the Danube in 1854, he went to the Crimea with a Scottish regiment. He acted as an examiner in surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, but he resigned the post on becoming a candidate for the office of vice-president in 1873. He served the college as president in 1874–5, and he was for more than twenty years surgeon to the City of Dublin Hospital. He died on 27 November 1885, and is buried in Mount Jerome cemetery, near Dublin. In 1844 he was married to Henrietta, daughter of Croasdaile Molony of Granahan, and widow of Robert Fannin. By her he left two daughters: Iva, married to Peter Leslie Peacocke; and Florence, married to Thomas Turbitt of Owenston.\nTufnell wrote: 1. ‘Practical Remarks on the Treatment of Aneurism,’ Dublin, 1851, 8vo. 2. ‘The Successful Treatment of Internal Aneurism,’ London, 1864, 8vo; 2nd edit. 1875. He also devised various surgical instruments.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Power, D'Arcy (1899). \"Tufnell, Thomas Jolliffe\".

        "content": "The Arusha Sports Stadium, is a planned multi-purpose stadium in Tanzania. It is intended to be used for the first time, during the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations soccer tournament. The stadium is one of the stadia that Tanzania plans to use during the tournament, that will be jointly hosted by Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe stadium would be located in the city of Arusha, in Arusha Region, in northeastern Tanzania. The proposed stadium will sit on a total of 36.1 acres (14.6 ha) of real estate, in \"Olmoti Ward\", on land owned by the Tanzanian Ministry of Culture Arts and Sports.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nArusha Sports Stadium is mainly intended for soccer matches, although other sports such as athletics are also expected to be practiced here. The stadium has a proposed capacity of 30,000. The primary purpose of this stadium is to be part of the host stadia that Tanzania will use to host the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations in a tri-state-host tournament to be held in the East African countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The other Tanzanian stadium is the 60,000 seater Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium, in Dar es Salaam.\nIn September 2023, the Confederation of African Football (CAF), announced the East Africa Pamoja bid by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania as the winning bid to host the 2027 AFCON tournament. The bid beat out other bids by other countries including Egypt, Senegal, Botswana and Algeria.\nAt the bidding stage the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) nominated Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium in Dar es Salaam and two new stadia, one in the capital city of Dodoma and the other in Arusha. In April 2024, The Citizen reported that the third stadium will not be the proposed new Dodoma Stadium, but instead the 15,000 seater Amaan Stadium in Zanzibar.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nThe engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract\nwas awarded to China Railway Construction Engineering Group Limited (CRCEG), a Chinese state-owned company at a contract price of TZS:286 billion (approx. US$111 million). Construction is expected to start in April 2024 and last approximately two years.\nOn 6 April 2024, the construction site was officially handed over to the contractor by Damas Ndumbaro, the Tanzanian Minister for Culture, Arts and Sports. Construction is expected to start immediately and last 22 months.\n\n\n== Official name ==\nSome stakeholders have proposed to name this stadium as Samia Suluhu Hassan Stadium, in honor of  Samia Suluhu Hassan, the current President of Tanzania. That decision awaits the opinion of the head of state.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of African stadiums by capacity\nList of stadiums in Africa\nList of stadiums in Tanzania\nSheikh Amri Abeid Memorial Stadium\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTanzania Football Federation Official Website",

        "content": "Daubeney Turberville (1612 – 21 April 1696) was an English physician.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTurberville was born at Wayford in Somerset in 1612, was the son of George Turberville of that place. He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 7 November 1634, graduating B.A. on 15 October 1635 and M.A. on 17 July 1640. On the outbreak of the civil war he took up arms for the king, and assisted in the defence of Exeter in 1645. On its surrender to Fairfax in April 1646 he retired to Wayford, and practised medicine there and at the neighbouring town of Crookhorn. He eventually removed to Salisbury, and at the Restoration on 7 Aug. 1660 took the degree of M.D. at Oxford. He made a speciality of eye diseases and acquired considerable fame. According to Walter Pope, he cured Queen Anne, when she was a child, of a dangerous inflammation in her eyes, after the court physicians had failed. He was also consulted for his eyes by Samuel Pepys, to whom ‘he did discourse learnedly about them’ (Pepys, Diary, 1848, iv. 472, 482, 483). He died at Salisbury on 21 April 1696, and was buried in the cathedral. His wife Anne, whom he married at Wayford about 1646, died without issue on 15 December 1694.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Carlyle, Edward Irving (1899). \"Turberville, Daubeney\".

        "content": "Erasmus Fröhlich (2 October 1700 – 7 July 1758) was an Austrian Jesuit mathematics teacher and numismatist. He also took an interest in history and astronomy. As a teacher at the Theresianum, he influenced a number of studies in the region in history, mathematics, and astronomy. He also served as the librarian at the Theresianum.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nFröhlich was born in Graz and joined the Jesuit order at sixteen. After studies in Graz and Vienna he taught mathematics at Klagenfurt and Vienna. His mathematics students included Karl Scherffer and  He also began to collect coins and study them. This interest was inspired by Father Christian Edschlager who had worked in Turkey and Greece and Father Karl Granelli. He wrote on coinage between 1733 and 1737 in Quatuor tentamina in re nummaria vetere and related works. In 1744 he wrote on coinage related to the time of Seleucus I Nicator Annales compendiarii regum et rerum Syriae (1744). This work included some historic and theological views which were disputed by Leipzig scholar Gottlieb Wernsdorf. His work attracted the attention of Empress Maria Theresia who appointed him teacher of history, archaeology and Greek at the Theresianum. His students included Count Coronini who wrote on the history of Gorizia and Istria and Georg Pray who wrote on Hungary. He collaborated with Maximilianus Hell (1720–1792) on astronomy and on optics with Louis Bertrand Castel. Other correspondents included Joseph Khell who succeeded him at the Theresianum and the astronomer Christian Rieger (1714–1780).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNotitia. Elementaris.

        "content": "Manipur State Congress was a political party in the princely state of Manipur around the time of Indian independence. It was influential in the Constitution-making Committee set up for formulating the Manipur State Constitution Act. It contested the election for the legislative assembly under the constitution in 1948. It was the largest party in the assembly, but failed to win a majority and sat in opposition. Following the merger of Manipur into India in 1949, it merged into the Assam provincial unit of the Indian National Congress.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1934, Nikhil Manipuri Mahasabha (NMM) was established by Hijam Irabot with the-then Maharajah Churachand Singh as president. By 1938 it had become a prominent political front advocating the democratization of the powers held by the Darbar [Council] and an overhaul of the corrupt colonial administration. The organisation called for abolition of exploitative taxes, reunification of the hills with the valley, establishment of self-rule, installation of a Panchayat system, and the establishment of a unicameral legislature based on suffrage. Around the period of World War II, 1940–1946, Irabot was imprisoned and later externed from the state. In prison, he had met communist leaders and was influenced by them. After release, he took part in kisan movements (farmers' movements). During his absence, other leaders took control of the Nikhil Manipuri Mahasabha.\nWhen Irabot returned to Manipur in 1946, according to commentators, the new leaders of NMM did not wish to relinquish control, and decided to marginalise Irabot. Their strategem was to accuse Irabot of collusion with the communists. In a letter written to Irabot in April, NMM made it clear that it sympathised with the Indian National Congress and that it was anti-communist. In a submission to the British Cabinet Mission, NMM is said to have proposed a 'united kingdom' for the whole of India with the central government controlling defence, finance, trade, communications, road and transport, taxes and foreign policy. In August 1946, NMM petitioned Maharaja Bodhchandra Singh for an immediate declaration of responsible government. The Maharaja appears to have been receptive to an extent.\nIn the meantime, Irabot had set up new organisations such as the Manipur Praja Mandal, Manipur Praja Sanmelani, Manipur Praja Sangha and Manipur Krishak Sabha. Through them, he promoted mass movements and competed with NMM.\n\n\n=== Relations with Indian National Congress ===\nRelations and strategies of Manipur parties with regard to Indian National Congress (INC) are subject to debate within Manipuri scholarship, with some scholars claiming that the Manipur State Congress was an integral part of the INC,\nothers denying that it had any relation with it, and some others being ambivalent.\nINC's policies towards the princely states are found by scholars to have been \"ambiguous and negligent\". The Haripura annual session in 1938 passed a resolution confirming the long-standing policy of non-involvement in the affairs of the princely states, but individual members were not barred from getting involved in personal capacity. These involvements were via the All India States Peoples' Conference (AISPC), a conglomeration of peoples' movements in the princely states. It appears that both NMM and the Manipur State Congress after its formation, were members of the AISPC, and these links extended back to the days of Irabot's leadership. Jawaharlal Nehru, a key INC leader, was elected AISPC president in 1939 and remained in that position till 1946. In his January 1946 presidential address to AISPC (in Udaipur), Nehru stated his vision that about fifteen to twenty large states might enter the Indian federation as autonomous units with their rulers as constitutional heads while the other states would be absorbed into the neighbouring British Indian provinces. He was opposed to the formation of unions of princely states.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nThe Manipur State Congress was formed on 4 October 1946, in a meeting convened\nat the Aryan Theatre in Imphal, with the agenda of bringing together all the political parties on a common platform so that pressure could be mounted on the Maharaja for responsible government. Irabot's parties, Manipur Krishak Sabha and Manipur Praja Sangha, were given one seat each on the governing committee, but Irabot himself was barred from being their representative on account of being a \"communist\". The accusation of Irabot created an ugly scene, with the result that Irabot and his colleagues left the meeting. The remaining organisations resolved to come together under the umbrella of Manipur State Congress. The president of the new party was R. K. Bhubonsana Singh and the general secretary was Yumnam Khoimacha.\n\n\n== Activities and fissures ==\nIn December 1946, the Maharaja declared the formation of a Constitution-Making Committee for the state. Manipur State Congress won all the five seats in the valley area for the Constitution-Making Committee. Irabot's parties boycotted the election, calling undemocratic. The Manipur State Constitution was ready by July 1947, ahead of schedule.\nAlmost a whole year passed before the election for the legislative assembly under the new constitution. On 11 August 1947, the Maharaja acceded to the Indian Union and also signed a standstill agreement to continue the existing arrangements as present under the British rule.\nThe Political Agent that used to be stationed under the British rule was replaced by a 'Dominion Agent' of the Government of India. Debeswar Sarmah, a high-ranking member of the Assam unit of INC, was appointed as the Domion Agent. The President of Manipur State Durbar, who governed the state under the British Rule, was replaced by an interim council headed by a chief minister, Maharaja's brother M. K. Priyobrata Singh having been selected for the post. Two out of the six members of the interim council were members of the State Congress.Parratt, Wounded Land (2005, pp. 97–99)\nThe formation of the interim council split the State Congress, with an opposition formed under the leadership of Elangbam Tompok Singh. It came to be called the 'Tompok Congress'. A faction under Tomal Singh (the 'Tomal Congress') supported the interim council as formed. It appeared that the Tompok Congress was integrationist, supporting measures for the integration of Manipur with India in some form.\nBefore the election, a new party called Praja Shanti came into being, widely believed to have been floated by the Maharaja and his Durbar elites. The party was pro-royalist and anti-Congress. When the election was held in June–July 1948, Manipur State Congress won 14 seats, but Praja Shanti was close behind with 12 seats. Praja Shanti was able to form the government with the support of Irabot's parties (6 seats) and the hill representatives, who were not affiliated to any of the valley parties (18 seats).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nChishti, S.

        "content": "TV Globo Brasília (channel 10) is a television station licensed to Brasília, Federal District, Brazil serving as the TV Globo station for the capital and its surrounding areas, owned-and-operated by Grupo Globo. Due to difficult reception in some areas, the station also operates on channel 20 UHF in Gama and Brazlândia. Its studios are in the North Radio and Television Sector (SRTVN), in the North Wing of Plano Piloto, and its transmitters are in the Brasília Digital TV Tower, in the administrative region of Lago Norte.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhile still preparing the installation of TV Globo in Rio de Janeiro, Organizações Globo received, on April 27, 1962, the concession to establish a television channel in Brasília, through a decree signed by Prime Minister Tancredo Neves. After Rede Globo was inaugurated in 1965, its signal reached the federal capital through TV Nacional, belonging to the Federal Government, between 1967 and 1969.\nAfter two years of preparations, TV Globo Brasília was inaugurated at 1:10 pm on April 21, 1971, the date on which Brasília celebrated its 11th anniversary. At the ceremony, in addition to Roberto Marinho, owner of the station, guests such as the governor of the Federal District, Hélio Prates da Silveira, the minister of Industry and Commerce, Pratini de Moraes, and the archbishop of Brasília, Dom José Newton de Almeida Baptista, who named the installations, were present. In its inaugural program, a football match between Vasco da Gama and Flamengo was aired, and the program Som Livre Exportação, carried out live at Concha Acústica in the Federal District and broadcast throughout the country.\nSince its founding, the station has been strategically fundamental for its inclusion in national news, for political topics. In 1983, Bom Dia Brasil started to be produced from Brasília, as at the time its format was predominantly about politics and economics.\nIn 1994, the broadcaster suffered a fire in its facilities, but this did not stop the production of programming. Until 1995, the broadcaster's programming also covered the municipalities surrounding the Federal District, but after the creation of TV Rio Vermelho de Luziânia, the programming was restricted only to the Federal District. In 1996, with the production of Bom Dia Brasil starting to be carried out in Rio de Janeiro, TV Globo Brasília began to only participate with articles for the network and with comments on the news.\nOn September 7, 2013, in one of the waves of protests taking place in the country, a group of protesters tried to invade the broadcaster's headquarters in Asa Norte. Vandals stoned cars that were in the parking lot and tried to break down the access door to the building, but were restrained by security guards and dispersed by the Military Police Riot Squad.\n\n\n== Technical information ==\n\nThe station officially started its digital transmissions on April 22, 2009, during DFTV's 2nd edition. On December 2, 2013, the station's news programs began to be produced in high definition, alongside the network's news programming.\nBased on the federal decree for the transition of Brazilian TV stations from analogue to digital signals, TV Globo Brasília, as well as other stations in the city of Brasília and the surrounding Federal District, ceased broadcasting on VHF channel 10 on 17 November 2016, following the official ANATEL timeline. The station's signal was interrupted at 11:59 pm during the broadcast of Adnight, being replaced by a notice from MCTIC and ANATEL about the switch-off.\n\n\n== Programming ==\nThe broadcaster participates live on national television with articles and comments about politics on television news, and also produces local programs.\n\nBom Dia DF: News, with Fred Ferreira and Natália Godoy;\nDFTV 1st edition: News, with Fabiano Andrade;\nGlobo Esporte DF: Sports news, with José Maurício Oliveira;\nDFTV 2nd edition: News, with Antônio de Castro;\nGlobo Comunidade: Journalistic, presented on a rotating basis\n\n\n=== History of local programming ===\nAt the time of its creation, TV Globo Brasília's journalism had in its programming, like other Globo stations, local versions or blocks of the network's news programs. Hoje was presented by Maria Luísa and Antônio Lúcio, and was produced entirely locally until 1974, when it became a block of the Rio version, now shown on the national network. The local section of Jornal Nacional was presented by Heitor Ribeiro, and later by Júlio César.\nOther programs would also appear throughout the 1970s, such as Globinho, a short television news program aimed at children, presented by Tania Mara, shown from 1974 onwards. In the same year, the bulletin Plantão Globo also debuted, with reports shown in daily segments, until 1976. That year, Jornalismo Eletrônico began to air, presented by Luís Lopes Correia, which lasted until 1978. And in 1977, it began to air the interview program Panel, presented by Claudio Lessa, will be shown, together with the national version made from Rio de Janeiro.\nIn 1979, Jornal das Sete debuted, presented by Carlos Campbell, which lasted until January 1, 1983. This year, with the total reformulation of the regional journalism of Rede Globo stations and affiliates and the adoption of the Praça TV journalistic standard, DFTV debuted on January 3, initially only with the night edition presented by Carlos Magno. In June of the same year, the afternoon edition of the newspaper debuted, presented by André Duda. Between March 1983 and March 1989, there was also a third edition of the newscast, shown after Jornal da Globo, with a presentation by Sérgio Machado, and later, by Ana Paula Padrão. Between March 25, 1984, and June 21, 1987, the news program was also shown on Sundays after Fantástico. In 1989, like the third edition, the first edition of the news program was discontinued, returning only in 1992.\nOn January 7, 1991, TV Globo Brasília debuted Bom Dia DF, presented by Carlos Campbell, being the last of the network's own stations to debut its version of the morning news program. Following the same pattern as Bom Dia Brasil, the program also featured interviews and debates about politics, carried out by Alexandre Garcia. Other names such as Paulo José Cunha, André Duda, Fabiana Fernandez, Carlos Magno and Cláudia Bomtempo also presented the news program in the 1990s. In the same year, Globo Comunidade also debuted, presented on Saturday mornings, and later on Sundays from 1996.\nBetween 2000 and April 6, 2002, the station aired the program Articultura, presented by Aline Maccari, which highlighted Brasília's cultural scene, with reports and special interviews with local artists. The program was produced in partnership with the production company Fabrika Filmes, and was shown on Saturdays, at noon.\nAt the end of the 90s and beginning of the 2000s, the journalistic standards Bom Dia Praça and Praça TV underwent new reformulations to adopt a more popular editorial line linked to the community. It is in the meantime that Bom Dia DF and DFTV are undergoing changes to the sets and command of the attractions. Fernanda de Brittany started to command the morning news program in 2001, while Alexandre Garcia and Márcia Zarur started to command DFTV 1st edition in the same year. Luiz Carlos Braga, who had already been in charge of DFTV 2nd edition since 1996, remained in charge of the news program until 2008, when he was fired by the broadcaster and migrated to TV Record Brasília.\nIn 2004, Liliane Cardoso took over Bom Dia DF, while Fernanda de Brittany started to present DFTV 1st edition with Alexandre Garcia replacing Márcia Zarur. In 2007, like other Rede Globo stations, the Radar DF news bulletin debuted, which provides information about traffic and weather, as well as short headlines. In 2008, Fernanda de Brittany was replaced by Camila Guimarães on DFTV 1st edition, and DFTV 2nd edition started to be presented by Antônio de Castro. In March 2009, the broadcaster's journalism expanded community participation with the creation of Redação Móvel, where the public participates live from a neighborhood in the Federal District.\nIn 2010, Liliane Cardoso started to present DFTV 1st edition in place of Camila Guimarães, who took Liliane's place on Bom Dia DF. However, in the same year, Fred Ferreira and Viviane Costa took charge of the morning news program. In 2011, Flávia Alvarenga replaced Fred Ferreira and Viviane Costa at Bom Dia DF, while Alexandre Garcia and Liliane Cardoso were replaced by Fábio William in charge of DFTV 1st edition. In 2012, the broadcaster began offering \"Globocop\", giving more dynamism to news programs with live aerial coverage. In the same year, on August 21, Globo Esporte became entirely local, under the command of Gabriel Ramos and Viviane Costa. In 2013, Flávia Alvarenga left the Bom Dia DF bench, being replaced by Guilherme Portanova, while Viviane Costa started to present Globo Esporte alone.\nOn November 7, 2015, Distrito Cultural debuted on Saturdays, a seasonal program presented by Márcia Zarur, which shows events in music, literature and the arts in the Federal District, running until December 28, 2019. On May 13, 2019, Beatriz Pataro debuted as presenter of Bom Dia DF, alongside Guilherme Portanova. Portanova left Bom Dia DF and the broadcaster on November 12, after signing with RecordTV Brasília, being replaced by Fred Ferreira, who returns to television news after 8 years.\nOn January 20, 2020, Natália Godoy takes over Bom Dia DF in place of Beatriz Pataro, who went to report, thus forming a pair with Fred Ferreira. In May 2020, after 7 years in charge of Globo Esporte, Stephanie Alves left the broadcaster, being replaced by José Maurício Oliveira. Still in 2020, TV Globo Brasília extinguishes Radar DF and its bulletins during programming, with the format remaining only in the \"Traffic in DF\" section of Bom Dia DF.\nOn April 5, 2023, with the series of layoffs promoted by Globo in its branches, journalists Fábio William and Márcia Witczak were laid off in Brasília. With Fábio's departure, DFTV 1st edition started to be presented by Fabiano Andrade.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The Black Boy is an 1844 painting by William Lindsay Windus in the collection of the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool, England.\nThe painting is an oil on canvas painting measuring 76.1 x 63.5cm and depicts a black child looking at the viewer. He is wearing torn clothing. It is the only portrait painting depicting an individual black child in the collection of the National Museums Liverpool. There are believed to be fewer than 10 individual portraits depicting a single Black figure from the mid 19th-century in British national collections.\nAn X-ray analysis of the painting revealed that four or five other faces were painted by Windus on the canvas before their erasure.\nAn 1891 catalogue listing described the boy as having been a stowaway that Windus had met on the steps of Liverpool's Monument Hotel on the London Road. The listing further described how a passing sailor had seen Windus's completed portrait in a frame maker's shop and reunited the child with his family. The story is believed to have been invented to make it more appealing to wealthy buyers who would have taken pity on the subject.\nIn 2024 the museum made a public appeal for more information about the child subject.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Museums Liverpool - The Black Boy",

        "content": "Roberto Costa de Abreu Sodré (21 June 1917 — 14 September 1999) was a Brazilian lawyer, businessman and politician. He was a state deputy, governor of the State of São Paulo and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil.\nHe was one of the founders of the National Democratic Union (UDN) in 1945, and later a member of the National Renewal Alliance (ARENA), from 1966. He was indirectly elected to the government of São Paulo, a position he held from 31 January 1967 to 15 March 1971.\nHe was married to Maria do Carmo Mellão de Abreu Sodré, who died on January 24, 2012, who was president of the Social Solidarity Fund, which she encouraged her husband to create as soon as he took over the São Paulo government in 1967.\nHis father, Francisco Sodré, was the second mayor of the municipality of Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo and was responsible for the arrival of the Sorocabana Railway tracks. Because of this, one of the districts of Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo was named Sodrélia.\n\n\n== Governorship ==\nAbreu Sodré was the first governor to be indirectly elected, for the period from 1967 to 1971, during the period of the Brazilian military dictatorship.\nIn energy, he continued with the state's energy plan, implementing the Urubupungá line towards São Paulo. In transport, he completed the first section of the Rodovia do Oeste, whose name was changed to Rodovia Castelo Branco, in honor of the recently deceased president. Abreu Sodré also began the construction of Rodovia dos Imigrantes, as an alternative to Rodovia Anchieta, which was already on the verge of saturation; also began the first excavations for the construction of the São Paulo Metro. His government was also responsible for acquiring the first Boeing 737 in Brazilian civil aviation, provided to VASP.\nIn basic sanitation, he created the companies Comasp (Companhia Metropolitana de Abastecimento), focused on water production, and Sanesp (Saneamento do Estado de São Paulo), focused on sewage treatment, companies that would later give rise to Sabesp (Companhia de Saneamento Básico do Estado de São Paulo), along with other state-owned companies. During this period, Abreu Sodré began water supply works for the Cantareira System, in the North Zone of the City of São Paulo;\nIn public security, during this period the state security force, then called Public Force, was renamed the Military Police; in addition to the name, the institution began to receive instructions and apparatus from the Army, DOI-CODI and other institutions linked to the military regime at the time.\nIn education and culture, he also oversaw the creation of the Fundação Padre Anchieta and the TV broadcasters TV Cultura and Rádio Cultura of São Paulo and also created the CEETEPS (Paula Souza State Center for Technological Education), a state agency linked to the Department of Development, Science and Technology, responsible for ETECs and FATECS, which offer secondary education, technical and higher education courses.\nA controversial gesture of his tenure was the gift he distributed to the players of the Brazilian team that won the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Sodré distributed miniatures of the Jules Rimet Trophy made in gold to the players and the coaching staff. The government ordered 50 miniatures, but only distributed 42; it is not known what happened to the other eight miniatures. The value of each one was Cr$2,800; in 2020, it would be equivalent to R$1,750,000.\n\n\n== President of state-owned company, minister and businessman ==\n\nIn 1980, Abreu Sodré was one of the founders of the Democratic Social Party (PDS), successor to ARENA. Abreu Sodré was also president of Eletropaulo in 1982.\nIn the Nova República, Abreu Sodré was Minister of Foreign Affairs during most of José Sarney's presidency (1986–1990), being succeeded by Francisco Rezek. During his term as foreign minister, Brazil resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1986, which had been severed since 1964, appointing Ítalo Zappa as ambassador. In 1988, while still a minister and affiliated with the Liberal Front Party (PFL), he supported João Mellão Neto, his nephew, from the Liberal Party (PL), in the municipal elections in São Paulo.\nIn the last years of his life, he abandoned public life, working as a lawyer and businessman.\n\n\n== References ==",
